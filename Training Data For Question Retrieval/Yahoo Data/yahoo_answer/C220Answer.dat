9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? Yes.. and you need to tell your doc that your craving those things (if you are), because your lacking in some sort of minerals and your body is making you crave those things, and he/she can advise you on what to take to replace those minerals, so that your not craving them anymore and getting what your body needs.|`|8oAlBL91aa	Troll|`|ZusC87WBaa	It's called pica and needs to be brought to the doctor's attention.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	Eating those things is not nearly as dangerous as the fact that they indicate your body is lacking certain nutrients that it is craving and trying to find.  Please tell your doctor about this.  They will not think you are weird, it is actually quite common.  The condition is called Pica.<br>  <br>  Brick is not exactly good for your teeth or digestive system, and mud could be contaminated with animal feces, runoff from fertilizer, etc.  Definitely not good for you!|`|bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	Eating mud and clay is a normal practice in some societies- it's how they get necessary minerals.  However, you can't be sure if there are chemicals or organisms that may be dangerous to you if you are eating it.<br>  <br>  Pica is a condition where a person eats non-nutritive substances as a craving because the body is deficient in some mineral it requires. It's often a sign of iron-deficient anemia.  You should have your blood tested if you are craving things like clay and dirt.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	um gross! yes it's harmful, lots of bacteria.|`|b0ff0526fe90638f8e2ac0fea7c1171caa	um what???? eating mud and bircks is harmful wheather your pregnant or not. grossss|`|h3HjLZ4daa	it's called pica, and while it's been theorized women do it because they are lacking some nutrient that's never been proven.<br>  <br>  is the condition harmful in and of itself?  no.<br>  <br>  can eating those things be harmful?  possibly if heavy metals or other toxins are consumed.|`|ACc1skbPaa	Of course it is whether you are pregnant or not...you need to tell your OB (if this is a real question) as cravings of this nature can be a sign of a metabolic disorder or hormonal issues related to pregnancy.|`|oWAUb6vpaa	Yes - you need to tell your doc asap and don't eat that crap. There may just be something missing from your diet. Tell doc - it's important that they know this. <br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations!|`|9a3sNrEqaa	okay I don't know if this is a real ? or not but you should NEVER go and eat mud or brick. Even if you weren't pregnant. GOOD LUCK!|`|AA10260497	i wouldn't think it exactly healthy|`|yKS2UI87aa	Tell your Dr. Immediately! I can't remember what it's called but they will need to see you. and no it's not safe|`|uTEr67Bhaa	Yes they are very harmful.  Tell you doctor ASAP!!

ay8tXLD2aa	Yes, you definitely need to dump your pumped stash. I know, it's hard.....<br>  <br>  My son is dairy and soy intolerant - if there's not milk in it, there's soy in it, so it's SOOOO hard to avoid both, and for us, hypoallergenic formula (Nutramigen) was the best option.  Gutted at first, but.....oh well. <br>  <br>  You can have soy milk, as well as rice milk, although neither are grat for cooking. <br>  <br>  Milk is also "hidden" in things like bread, so be careful with that. The small amounts of milk in bread combined with the small amount of the milk protein that makes it through your breast milk may mean that it doesn't affect your children, but it may.  You might have to do a "milk challenge" to test it.  <br>  <br>  There are TONS of websites for dairy free living, although most use soy as an option, so if you find out they are MSPI (milk/soy protein intolerant) then you will have to do some more digging. There is a great cookbook by (uuuhhhh thinking here, Tamara somone?) - check on Amazon for "MSPI cookbook" that has recipes for the diet. <br>  <br>  Good luck, it can be tough, but if you are able to do this for your children, you can do anything!!  Well done for giving it a go in order to keep BFing!!!!|`|dzNnf3LHaa	I would read the label on everything, if it contains milk or nut products, don't eat it.  Remember he is just guessing, this may not be the case at all.  I would keep my breastmilk in the freezer and see how the babies do in a month or so, if they stay the same then it is obviously not an allergy but if they improve then you doctor guessed right and I would dump the milk.
d6e11chxaa	Broday sounds so fancy! *wink* <br>  <br>  I think a lot of people ask about nicknames because they want to know what you'll allow. For James, we've asked for people to call him James or Jamey only, not Jim or Jimmy. You can pick their nicknames, and give people options if they don't like the name for now. Of course, once they're old enough to speak up for themselves, your child will tell you what they like to be called, and there's not too much you can do! My family loved calling me Katie as a little girl, but around three, I demanded to be called Katherine only. I like Finley on a boy, but you know how I feel about unisex names on girls, dear. I can't believe that people are so rude about it! I do think it's a sweet name, and works really well with your boys. I think Liam sounds bit funny with Finley, but I'll go into detail on your other question.|`|yXGlmUqlaa	i know. i agree. i always thought nicknames we given by people because of personality and what not. not something to be thought of.<br>  <br>  i understand having a long family name or something and saying her name is ouhfdgjkdfgkbfdbghbgjhd but we're just going to call her ksjfhs.<br>  <br>  but yeah i agree.<br>  <br>  Finley wouldn't be my choice but it's a cute name.|`|IvkNTqDMaa	Although I myself am not really a fan of the name Finley, if that's the name you'd like for your child then that's fine...I do not think you should have a nickname...I cannot stand when people come on here saying "If I name my child _____, what should his/her nickname be?"...why do they need a nickname?? Call them by their name!|`|NNki7qiFaa	I agree with you. People keep asking "What nicknames would be good for these names?" Why don't you just call the kid what you named them? It's annoying.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I agree with it.|`|VEkkn2Otaa	Well whoever said that is dumb or jealous cause they have an ugly name! Finley is perfect!!!|`|ORa2ZNAlaa	I actually HATE nicknames! If you are naming your child, you want them to have that name. For instance, if I wanted to name my baby Katie, I would do just that, and not name her Katherine and nick her that just because people say there should be a "proper" name on a birth certificate.<br>  <br>  Brody, Riley and Finley are extremely gorgeous names and do not need a nick name! <br>  <br>  PS I love Finley (esp on a girl!!)|`|tVvXHynfaa	First off- chill out.<br>  Some people try to think of nicknames because, as a child, some names do not fit well. Let's take, for instance, Eleanor. You don't see very many, if any, children walking around being called Eleanor. However, you will see Ellie's and Elle's and Nora's... Some names are better suited for children, and then for adults.<br>  Now, if you're going to get so upset over what someone said on Yahoo! Answers, why are you even asking? It's your child, not theirs. If you want to name him/her Finley, then name her Finley. I guarantee you, somewhere along the line, she will be called "Lee" or "Fin." It's an okay name, but really? Come on. We're all just voicing our opinions because YOU asked. If you don't want to hear the negative responses then don't ask. Plain and simple.|`|UXxsDUECaa	My name is Alyson and people try to call me Aly. Its  so annoying and I hate it. <br>  <br>  I hate nicknames sometimes. Especially when parents pick out nick names before their kids are born.<br>  <br>  My sister is Emelia Lucille and my parents wanted to call her Emie Lu.<br>  They never call her that because it just doesn't suit her at all.|`|groIDUPJaa	I can't stand nicknames either.  Stick to your choices, I like them, and just ignore everyone who isn't so nice.|`|1WS0ojj5aa	I have no idea the same with me when I was pregnant and her name is Jalissa. Just Jalissa. Not Jelly. Not lyssa. Jalissa. I guess some people cant understand that.|`|DhmjLRoUaa	Im the one that said it was stupid. and i still think it is.|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	My nickname is Brandy and they knew that would be the nickname when they chose my name, I think Finley is cute, it is unique and different. It isn't my favorite name but it is sweet. I am not sure if I would personally use it on a boy or a girl. Some people choose names with a specific nickname in mind, we love the name Lillian and we already know when we have a daugther we will call her Lilly/Lily, that was how I started liking the name Lillian. In your case it is different and don't let people bother you. It is everyone's OPINION, it shouldn't affect your life at all. Good luck....|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I'm with you on that one. I thought nicknames were something that happened by chance and stuck with you, but they had a meaning. I see so many postings on here of people trying to nickname their kids before they are even born. It's ridiculous!|`|0fbb5e27ed4790306bd5062233798e68aa	I think they are your children and you gave birth to them and if you want to name them shoe cream it is up to you. I personally like the names you have given each one of your children. They are unique names but I like them. Nicknames are given regardless of your real name sometimes. I would not worry so much about what other people think.|`|DHW8x1d8aa	Probably to avoid embarassing nicknames which some names get, eg Lucy always gets Juicy Lucy and Loose-y. People don't want their child to be teased (although obviously they will be if not for their name for something else).<br>  <br>  And people see it as affectionate, not many people with names like Elizabeth use their full first name as it is too long, there's also the idea that hardly anyone likes their first name at some point in their life(normally young/ teenage years) and will probably go by a nickname at some stage in their life, future parents want to prepare for what other people or their child may change their name too.<br>  <br>  I agree that Finley is fine on it's own, it isn't too long and doesn't need a nickname however someone will call him/ her Fin at some point in his/ her life.<br>  <br>  I personally like Finley Rose but I don't think the Ley of Finley and the Li of Liam go well together.|`|LoP2CRE2aa	I think that was rude an uncalled for of him, but it happens so much on this site. People have anonymity, and a lot of them feel like this gives them a reason to be a jerk. Don't worry about it too much.<br>  <br>  I don't really consider nicknames when choosing names, unless there is a particular reason. for example, I love the name Dell but most people don't. Since I wouldn't want to name my daughter something she might hate or get picked on for, I think I would name her Adelle rather than Della and call her Della for my own pleasure. That way she could choose which name she wanted to go by in school or what not. <br>  <br>  But as far as choosing a name based on a nickname, that seems just silly to me. Besides, even if people did end up calling him/her Finn, I think its cute!!<br>  <br>  Good luck again and I hope you get your little girl! (or boy :D)|`|rGWiOVDIaa	Exactly. Why give a kid a name and a nick name? If you don't like the name in the first place then you shouldn't have named it that. However, my sister named her daughter MaryJane. I think that is stupid and mean to the kid. Since before she was born I called her Mary. My sister regrets it now, but wouldn't listen to us then.<br>  <br>  If you ask "what do you think of this name" and someone tells you, don't be offended. You asked. I like Brody and Riley but think Finley is something the child will be teased about. Brody and Riley are somewhat old fashioned but they sound like the tough/cool kids. Finley sounds like a name the other two would to beat up for his/her lunch money.
AA12220887	I have the same problem with my 3.5 year old.  I think it's because your son is with you 99% of the time.  Do you have a neighbor, friend, Grandma, Grandpa that your son could go to for awhile to give him a break from Mommy?  What about play groups to get some social interaction?|`|0IPxeDJiaa	Congrats about your baby!  The fact that you love it and don't seem to encourage him to find other activities might be part of the problem, but it also sounds very normal.  I wouldn't worry too much, just make sure you're spending one on one play time with him.  It sounds as if you have your hands full.|`|LZfEhqYdaa	I think that it is a combination of his age and your pregnancy.  My son is only 1, but I have been told that sons become very attached to mommy around 2 - 3.  And when I was pregnant with my son, my daughter was 2, and she was very touchy-feely and snuggly.  She wanted to be on my lap anytime I was resting.  I think it is so normal, and it will pass.  I hope you are able to really enjoy this bonding time with him before the baby comes.  Blessings to you and your growing family!|`|LoLwBDnIaa	It could be a phase.<br>  <br>  But if you get him to join a club like acting or dancing and maybe he will leave you alone a little. Or if you give him all the attention you have and keep bugging him he might back off a bit.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	I personally think it is bc ur prego bc my son is don the same thing   & he is 12 months old but i cant do anything without him holding on to my leg or something
AA12145826	Ah...I remember this stage. Some say its your subconscious fears being played out in your dreams, other say its just hormones going wacky. Personally, I think its the former assisted by the later. We all have deep down fears about impending motherhood, whether its your first child or your 14th, and having all those hormones running through your body isn't helping calm those fears. In my weird dreams, the diaper company took my child away because I wasn't measuring up to their standards of being a "good parent" or I would forget her in places like a public bathroom or even at the hospital. Weird, I know.<br>  <br>  Don't worry, its normal to have these dreams and chances are none of them will come even remotely true.|`|AA11481603	It sounds as though you have concerns about your mother being pushy in how you raise your child.|`|sNvF6KPbaa	Its a sign that you have to raise this baby|`|U1RcZjqJaa	Maybe you're afraid that your mom will want him as her own, but that's probably too practical for dreams :) I had a dream after my sister told me she was pregnant (she is 3 months behind me). I dreamed she was trying to kill me by torturing me (like in the Saw movies) and she blew my ears out (like in a cartoon) and there was a hole you could see through in my head. So I had to go through this wearhouse to find my parents and when I found them, my whole family was sitting around fawning over her baby, Gross dream. But the weirdest one I've had!|`|OaOf4oxQaa	Is your baby very young by the way? Maybe you are just getting used to him.|`|bQfwwUYhaa	death is coming|`|zOUEE48haa	ok that is a weird dream but dreams dont neccesarily mean anything!!maybe whbaby anden you went to sleep you were thinking of your son and moms conflicts if u do have,but anyways ive had so many weird dreams and nothing happens one time i dreamed when i was preggo that i lost my baby and had blood all over my clothes but you know what i was just to worried about my baby.<br>  my baby is 18 months and very healthy dreams dont mean anything<br>  ive had all kind of dreams death,that iam dead,family, that imeven rich<br>  <br>  so just dont stress out and before you go to sleep drink a glass of milk|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Your 'house' when you're dreaming is usually a symbol of your 'mind' - where 'you' live.  So, you're still feeling like you live in your mother's house, within the structure that she built and supplied for you.  <br>  <br>  It sounds like you're working towards breaking away from that a bit, making the place where your subconscious mind lives into something that belongs to you, where you are in control, not mom.  <br>  <br>  The baby is not, necessarily, the actual baby that's coming but could be, instead, the birth of this new 'you', the 'you' that you want to create, want to be.  <br>  <br>  It sounds like you're worried that things won't go according to your plan, though, but in your dream you're flexible enough to switch to plan B and persistent enough to think that you'll try again later. <br>  <br>  The second dream has your mother trying to direct your life again, calling your baby (or the new direction in your life) by a name that is not the name you chose, that you want it to have.  <br>  <br>  Again, this is you feeling like you need to step out on your own path, creating your own life, away from what mom wants & has created for you. <br>  <br>  <br>  This doesn't have to be contentious, though.  This can be peaceful for both of you, in your real life.  You can honor what she has provided for you so far & what she can offer you in the future, but still, respectfully, responsibly & confidently, live your own life.|`|N6VykHCFaa	Its just a dream. no worries.<br>  But if you want to know we can't<br>  decode your dream only you can.<br>  I can't remember my weirdist dream,<br>  but my dream last night was pretty weird.
IHgU9sK7aa	It is possible for some pregnancy test to give you a false negative. I would try a different brand and if that comes out negative, i'm would feel pretty confident to say that your not pregnant. Rather be safe than sorry.  As for your symptoms, if you are experiencing any type of stress or depression it can really pay a toll on your body. For some woman it results in missing there period. I know when i was working two jobs and going to school i lost my period for THREE months. I was not pregnant, but i was suffering from stress.|`|F3BRG72iaa	well there is still a chance that you are.. my friend had to take 6 pregnancy test to find out she was pregnant, all 5 came back negative and the 6th one came back positive so good luck|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? My guess would be that your not pregnant, if you took 2 test and they are negative.|`|t2X3lBCYaa	Why dont you go to the DR's? you will find out for sure,You probly want to be on the safe side.|`|bpqxtkFfaa	Well if the hpt tests say NO then its a no dear. If you're period is late then there should have hcg in you. I dont think you are pregnant. Sorry|`|a0Vg5vMyaa	most of the time test are not right!
oWAUb6vpaa	You may be in labor, luv! <br>  <br>  Good thing you have your doctor's appointment today so you'll know for sure. Tell him what your feeling. <br>  <br>  Congratulations, mom!|`|8oAlBL91aa	I think your going to be a mommy today or sometime in the next few days. You probably feel the baby's head baring down and it's probably causing your pelvic muscles to hurt. Best of luck.|`|IHgU9sK7aa	i agree, you may be experiencing mild contractions. You are probably going to go into labor any day or minute. Congratulations.
84558de0349fa374ed3605ac33e8e36daa	I agree with you, she could keep him busy. That's what a good babysitter does. If she just wants to be lazy and not deal with the babies, then she shouldn't be a babysitter. I completely understand you!!<br>  Find another babysitter that actually is worth spending your money on.|`|rxScdXM4aa	yes she could keep him entertained while the other children are napping. however, you didn't mention weather or not she is legally watching your child, and if she's not then you really don't have a right to complain and neither does she. she could be arrested for illegally watching children. <br>  <br>  look at some other places and then talk about it with her|`|IPSWR5w2aa	If your babysitter isnt going to take the time to do her job right, and do what is best for your baby, I say you should get a new one anyway. It doesnt sound like she has your sons best intrest in mind. And you can go on websites like <a href="http://www.babysitters4hire.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.babysitters4hire.com/</a> and view some in your area. Good Luck|`|bMyq2nOTaa	I'd fire her.|`|c0R0apSVaa	Yes, she can EASILY keep him busy. I babysit and I keep a baby busy, easily. Put him a bouce-and-move, play with him on the ground, read, or anything, really...<br>  Plus, she shouldn't leave him in a room if he's "screaming and screaming". I understand trying to have him in there for a few minuets, but if this is a repetitive issue, this shouldn't be happening. <br>  In my opinion, you need a new babysitter. Try finding a day care now. They have a much shorter nap time and the kids play and interact with more kids.Less time with an adult, but it's more rewarding in the long run for your child. <br>  Good luck! :-)|`|lzB6Amiuaa	Ok, here's my two cents: I am a babysitter also. I watch two kids during the day, a 1 and 2 year old and I have a scheduled naptime. For several reasons. <br>  <br>  A) Kids are much easier to deal with when fully rested. They need that down time. It actually concerns me that your 9 month old is not napping and makes me question your ability to get him on a regular sleeping schedule. He is NOT too young to be on a schedule, so stop trying to act like he is. He will be a toddler in 2 months.<br>  <br>  B) At your job, I am sure you can pee in peace and quiet, I'm sure you have enough quiet to hear yourself think, and I'm sure you get two breaks AND a lunch where you can have complete solitude and re-group. She doesn't have this.<br>  <br>  My last concern is the amount you are paying her. You are almost taking advantage of her with that pay!! Even at $7.00 an hour from the two kids, I made more than that working at a retailer! And for the amount of work she does during the day....give her a voluntary raise, lady!! Show her you appreciate her watching your most valuable possession everyday while you can go off and earn probaby triple what she is.<br>  <br>  Now get down off your high horse and start to get your kids on a schedule.|`|AA11481603	She is obviously looking for "easy money" by keeping the kids napping as long as possible and avoiding having to interact or entertain the kids. I'd say find another sitter as quickly as possible.|`|OaOf4oxQaa	Get someone who will just take care of your son. Things might get out of hand and you don't want to go there. Good luck and do this for your son.|`|ae12c1d8c1c47a1b878b6100f2dccc4eaa	She sounds very rude, but she may also be under a lot of stress from watching the 4 kids everyday.  I am not sticking up for her, but I do have a suggestion.  One day, why don't you take your son over to her house and stay the entire day.  You can see if she's doing something that is affecting his behavior.  He's 9 months old, he's not going to communicate to her that he isn't tired by having a full blown conversation with her.  No wonder when he's upset he cries and screams.  I'm surprised that she hasn't asked you suggestions on soothing him, and just so rapidly decides that you NEED to find a new babysitter.  Not every child naps, but a nap every now and then is good for infants.  He shouldn't be required to nap and she could keep him busy with plenty of activities like you said.  If she's not willing to do this, she's not the right nanny / babysitter for you.  She should be more flexible and willing to work with you considering you are paying her to take care of your pride and joy.  A great place to look for a new sitter is on craigslist.  Just make sure they have their clearances, are cpr certified, and have excellent references.  Best of luck.|`|p9GOxzsNaa	You might need to start working with your son on how to relax and comfort himself so that your son is ok to be left alone for napping and quiet time. Discuss with the caregiver a pre-nap routine that you do on the weekends to help your son to nap longer. Children need the naps, so your caregiver is naturally concerned by the lack of the nap time, plus the disruption to the other childrens' naps. Ask your caregiver for details on the nap timeframe and see if you can coordinate the weekend naptimes on the same schedule and create a familiar routine. These nap times are typical for young children. Most pre-schools up to kindergarten age incorporate at least a 1/2 hour to 2 hours of nap time. Since the other three children would nap except that your son keeps them from napping, this is causing disruption to the routine and the need for quiet time. The issue is probably that the other children are refusing to nap due to your son persistently keeps them awake with screaming. This behavior could be an early indicator of a future ADHD or emotional issues, so your caregiver is doing you a favor to have you seek someone who can provide full one on one care at this point. Unless you are willing to work with the caregiver on creating a consistent nap routine for your son, then it seems your lack of action has left the caregiver, who has been unsuccessful to get your son on a nap schedule, with no alternate options except for her to look for another child who is able to adapt to the routines the children need for naps, and you will need someone who can provide fulltime one on one care. I'm sure your caregiver does not mean to offend you, however caregivers usually need some nap downtime to prepare lunch and snacks, eat their own lunch and take a bathroom break, or do other caregiving related chores.|`|zOUEE48haa	Ok i think shes being harsh thats is no excuse it doesnt really matter if he doesnt want to take a nap.she could try playing with him,take him a shower,also a ride around the block or park things like that.let me tell you something this lady is just lazy!!!!!!!she just doesnt have any patience i think you shouldnt leave your son with her, thats no reason for not wanting taking care of him i mean i would feel terrible if a babysitter would tell me that. mi nephew used to cry nonstop at 2-3 months old and my sister took care of him she would never tell mi sis oh no he wont sleep or his crying too much idont want to take care of him<br>  <br>  my suggestion is look for another good babysitter i know its hard but theres a good one out there<br>  this lady is just lazy and please be carefull she might even do something to your son
ouUti34faa	Yes and no. The inconsistent, harsh discipline from her father caused her to be domineering (may also be a family trait), but her mother's consistent submissiveness is what has really messed her up. Consistency is imperative, but holds no strength when there is no discipline. There needs to be a balance, but in this case there is none. Best wishes for your friend. An attitude like that can get a girl into a mound of trouble.|`|OaOf4oxQaa	Yes consistent as to follow the rules you set in the house and if not you get punished. That is being consistent. But discipline, well it depends on the child. You see not many parents have discipline themselves. I think that the best way for a parent to make sure their children are following the right path is to accept them for who they are and be there for them no matter what. The world is a threat for all our children, why not make them confident and secure people who will be able to stand up for themselves when we as parents are not around. Why should we control the youth, we should teach them and model appropriate behavior.|`|M2yERqNSaa	gee YOU THINK ? she knows when her father is away she can act like a little *****|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Agree <br>  <br>  However, when a parent is gone a lot (my husband is ex-military), this is pretty common.... whether the other person is a push-over or not.  Our oldest was a baby while he was gone so this wasn't an issue for us but I've been around enough military to know this is a *very* common issue.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	It sounds like, by 'consistent', you mean that both parents should do things the same way. <br>  <br>  That's not really important.  Kids can learn in different ways from different people.  What *is* important is that whoever is parenting her is actively parenting, actively trying to reach & teach the child.  <br>  <br>  It doesn't sound like your friend's mom is doing that at all.  <br>  <br>  It also doesn't sound like her father is doing that very effectively - he seems to be confusing 'controlling' with 'teaching', leaving her not knowing how to make good choices when he's not there controlling her.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	Can't say what made her this way but I can tell you that yes, consistency is the MOST important part of discipline for children...for anyone really.<br>  If children are allowed to run through the house one night while playing tag because mom and dad think it's cute, but the very next day mom and dad tell the kid to stop running through the house, the child is not going to KNOW that running through the house is not okay.  The child will have learned that it is okay sometimes and not others.  He/she will constantly be trying to run through the house, not sure if THIS time is the time it's okay or not.<br>  Running through the house is only a minor example.  Bigger issues like talking back, lying, and disobedience all  need to be dealt with the same way and with the same severity every time in order for children to know what to expect.  Knowing what to expect is what helps them to make good decisions.|`|DRb4Qlypaa	No more than likely it was her father's parenting. That is known as positive discipline. It is like getting a speeding ticket. A ticket doesn't teach an adult to stop speeding, just to slow down next time they see the punisher. Same thing for this girl. It does not teach her to change her behavior, just to modify it when her father is around. <br>  Parents forget that their kids need them to explain things to them, like explaining why people wont like you if you are domineering.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Most definitely it matters. If her mother does not make her behave then of course she will get walked all over. That's common sense. She's brought it on herself. She needs to step up and teach her daughter to act like a young lady and not a spoiled brat.|`|TV1Fvhfxaa	Yes.
Ccq8zEcnaa	Yes, it's caffeine free and safe for pregnancy.. And actually better than sprite and stuff because it's natural ingredients|`|0SIhrYCbaa	7up is caffiene free. All clear sodas are I think. And Root beer, Orange,Grade. Drink away.|`|8oAlBL91aa	Yep<br>  <br>  No caffeine then I don't see why it can't be an everyday drink.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	You can pretty much drink anything in moderation. Just watch the sugar intake, you don't want to end up with gestational diabetes. You are also allowed to have up to 200mg of caffeine per day.|`|nBGjPwViaa	You should be fine!!!!<br>  Drink up!|`|gCBqdHf2aa	yes thats fine just don't have to much b/c of all the sugar|`|4GwTDea1aa	Should Be Fine..<br>  But has a lot of sugar so later onin the pregnancy baby could be bouncing off of the walls literally lol.. pretty amazing feeling! <br>  Drink Up!<br>  A 7 UP sounds yummp now :o)|`|2LO5UXUTaa	Should be fine, I can't go through the day without drinking Root Beer. It is also caffeine free.|`|RnopSbHqaa	why dont you go to the doctor and ask them they would know thw correct answer|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	it is fine but if they had diet it would b even better
j083iujcaa	I think this is a question you really need to ask your OBGYN instead of a bunch of people on the internet.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	well first of all, Tylenol is the safest drug to take during pregnancy, any doctor will tell u this.<br>  <br>  second of all, wut the heck does Vicodin have to do w/ ADD? why do u need Vicodin? r u in pain? i mean, i understand headaches and all, but headaches is not a good enough reason to take Vicodin. the only time i was given that was for my kidney stones, and i've had migraines for years.<br>  <br>  also, i think ADD and ADHD is made up anyway, i think a lot of people misdiagnose kids nowadays saying they have it, bc one of the "symptoms" is being hyper, which is perfectly normal for a child/teen. so good for u that u stopped taking it.<br>  <br>  and i don't believe Vicodin is safe during pregnancy, i'd suggest contacting an OB/GYN instead of a regular doctor, OB/GYN is specialized in pregnancy and delivery and they would know more info on what to take and wut not to.<br>  <br>  ps. u could be having headaches due to the pregnancy, it's very common to have them in the 1st trimester, also getting off meds, that means ur body needs to get used to not having Adderall in ur system without any other meds.|`|oWAUb6vpaa	NO. <br>  <br>  I've suffered from migraines for a decade and I refused to take anything during pregnancy. Surprisingly, the migraines subsided during my 2nd trimester. You'll get used to it and it'll go away. Take a nap and stay as relaxed as possible. It's safest to not take anything and let nature do it's thing. You'll be happy about that decision in the future. <br>  <br>  Congratulations mom and good luck!|`|sYUYkrzKaa	NO! FDA pregnancy category C. This medication may be harmful to an unborn baby, and could cause breathing problems or addiction/withdrawal symptoms in a newborn. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during treatment.<br>    Acetaminophen and hydrocodone can pass into breast milk and may harm a nursing baby. Do not use this medication without telling your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	What someone else's doctor may have okayed for them,may not be okay for you. You need to inform your OB of everything you are taking and let him weigh the pros and cons of you taking this during pregnancy. You can't take the word of someone over the internet or what their doctor said.|`|ee98025b513c047ed69a68224b1fb014aa	Well, I don't know about Vicodin's side effects on pregnancy, but since it is so strong I would definitly consult a doctor beforehand.|`|pJFb4LRlaa	Before i knew i was pregnant i had my wisdom teeth taken out. They give you vicodin for recovery for the pain afterwards. Anyway, when i found out i was pregnant i immediately told my doctor of the incident and she said that since it was early early weeks of pregnancy, then it should be okay. But she asked me if i was still taking them, and of course, i said no. So, i'm not sure i would take any before asking your doctor, because mine seemed a little concerned...|`|3Oiwh3Ivaa	The difference between tylenol and vicodin is that vicodin has a narcotic in it called hydrocodone . Which you already know. It is not safe for your unborn child especially in the first trimester. You come on here acting like you don't know what's up. Just say I want to get high and my unborn child don't mean nothing to me!|`|JWHtk4Xbaa	Yes Vicodin is SAFE to be taken durning pregnancy. My mom was on Vicodin for headaches and backaches when she was pregnant with me. And everything turned out fine. My cousin is 17wks and her doctor prescribed Vicodin for her.|`|AA10260497	vicodin is safe during pregnancy|`|5rXybyXwaa	As Katie W said - you really need to be asking your doctor this question, rather than a bunch of strangers on the internet who have no medical training whatsoever.<br>  <br>  I seem to remember my doctor telling me no drugs of any kind should be taken during the first trimester, except in very extreme cases, because none of them are good for a fetus at that stage in their development.<br>  <br>  <br>  That aside, take a look at this detailed information for Health Professionals on Vicodin from Drugs.com: <a href="http://www.drugs.com/pro/vicodin.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drugs.com/pro/vicodin.html</a><br>  <br>  Look about halfway down the page under "Pregnancy". You'll see the following paragraph:<br>  <br>  "There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Vicodin Tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus."<br>  <br>  And a bit further down in the same section is this:<br>  <br>  "Babies born to mothers who have been taking opioids regularly prior to delivery will be physically dependent." (FYI - Vicodin is an opioid.)|`|ACc1skbPaa	I would talk to the physician who knows you and your particular case...sometimes Doctors prescribe something because the benefit outweighs the risks, but they still carry risk and should be done in conjunction with your physician...did you stop the Adderall with the doc's permission?  Sometimes stopping cold turkey is a bad idea wrought with side effects...most docs would have you wean off of it at a more steady pace...if he/she prescribed it knowing you had a possible pregnancy, I would double check with them at let them know that you are definitely pregnant and what do they suggest...Good Luck.
PTdy6TWRaa	Try to provide more times and activities where the 3 year old boy is the center of attention and can be the one making choices. It sounds like right now he's acting up for attention and may be getting terribly frustrated by a controlling sister who is more adept at manipulating attention and everything else in her favor.  <br>  <br>  Since they spend so much time together it may be causing him to reach a breaking point with his level of frustration. His screaming at you is not really about you but more likely a way of venting his frustrations with everything else - particularly his sister. <br>  <br>  He needs time away from his sister, to do boy things, make his own choices without feeling threatened by the possibility that anyone else is going to come along and manipulate or bully him out of his fun. When that stress of being overwhelmed by an older sibling is reduced and when he feels more control and appreciation his moods may settle. Good luck.|`|OCMSTxYfaa	they are getting mixed messages, one from mom (who probably doesn't follow through) and one from you. you must follow through every time...one minute time out for each year of age, and make it stick. rewards for good behavior and you and mom have to be on the same page. if you  aren't getting 100 percent of mom's cooperation, you are fighting a loosing battle.
Q05rrSX4aa	Cramps are normal in early pregnancy and can be painful.  However if they are overly painful where they are scaring you, I would get it checked out.  The reason is that a lot of pain like that can mean an ectopic pregnancy and that can be fatal to you. It is probably normal, but see a doctor about it to be sure.<br>  <br>  Good Luck:)|`|4GwTDea1aa	Most likely just your uteris stretching.. tends to feel like period cramps! Also might be the pants but at 8 weeks probably not!<br>  Good Luck|`|LY2LSzPJaa	Mild cramping is common durning 1st and 2nd trimester , tight pants could do it , start buying a larger size! <br>  Ask your doctor if you are worried|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	go to the doctor<br>  <br>  but for some info...i had period cramps during the first three months of my pregnancy ... <br>  <br>  the tight pants could be it...why dont you try going up a size...you'll need it later in your pregnancy either way
jHH3G56Jaa	thats really all you  can do. He is still a baby, take your time and he will learn what to do.|`|tLGbtmGsaa	He is probably not use to it.  Keep doing what your doing.  Just offer little amounts and once he starts to eat more confidently then offer him more.  Still keep giving him his milk as that is still his main source of nutrition.  It took my twins 3 months to get used to food and they would have days where they ate nothing because they refused to open their mouths.  They are 14 months and are eating really well now.  He will be fine, Good luck :)|`|vUoEgKxpaa	when their ready to start eating solids they will open their mouths for it, i dont think he's ready, just give it a little time.|`|3L7D2TVWaa	What I would recommend is to hold off on solids a while longer, he's just not ready, thats all! What I do is feed my son Whole Grain Organic Rice Cereal, which i get at Target. I use 6 oz bottles. I put one scoop his regular formula and 2 scoops rice cereal. It keeps him full alot longer. you have to make the hole bigger in the nipple to let the thicker stuf fthrough. He loves it and sucks it down every time! Hes 5 months old. I started doing that at 4 months because i wasnt able to breastfeed and he seemed unsatidfied after the formula. Hed eat every 2 hrs, when he was supposed to be slowing down. Try that for now if you want, your son will get the hang of it in a couple months or so. id try it once a day just to get him to learn to open his mouth, but not when hes starving, do it between feedings just to teach him. If he seems un-interested, thats ok, all babies go at their own pace! when i give my son cereal off a spoon, he moves it around in this mouth and then pushes it back out with his tongue, beacuse he doesnt know how to swallow solids yet. when a baby bottle or breast feeds, the milk usually goes right down their throat, so solids is a lot more work for them!<br>  hope that helps, good luck!|`|pXSKSS3daa	Yes, that would be force feeding.<br>  <br>  Unless your son is opening his mouth ON HIS OWN then he isn't ready for solids. Plain and simple.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Yes, unfortunately you are forcefeeding him, and that's not a good idea.<br>  <br>  He needs to be eating because he's hungry and wants the food, not because you sneak it in whenever he opens his mouth.<br>  <br>  If he isn't opening his mouth voluntarily for the spoon, just stop for a while.  THere is NO rush here. He doesn't yet need any solids. Some babies dont' want solids until they can feed themselves, and that's fine.
z9st8cLvaa	I don't have kids myself, but I did a lot of babysitting over the years, and I can say with certainty that I had some clients whose children I preferred over others for many reasons.  Some children were very well behaved and outgoing, others threw temper tantrums for six hours straight.  My job was to make sure the kids were safe and well-taken care of in their parents' absence, not to love them or even like them.  Don't take it too personally- every babysitter will have different preferences. :)|`|AA10730513	Yes. And I was fortunate enough to be in a position where I could stop having her watch my daughter. <br>  <br>  My kid was 2 years old. The lady had a lot of nice nick-knacks out. She let my daughter play with them, and a few of 'em got chipped. Apparently she decided that my child is destructive. And I decided that she must not be a very good sitter if she thinks you can give a child little figurines and not get them broken.|`|PTdy6TWRaa	Yes it happens all the time. Even here on a regular basis you see postings from sitters and nannies talking about how they dislike the kids they have to look after. It's really not unusual unfortunately.<br>  <br>  Anyone can get a job as a sitter or nanny but not everyone is really cut out for it. I've been through some sitters and preschool teachers that I saw clearly didn't like some of the kids - and the kids knew it! It's not fair to put the kids through that, and there are good kind people out there so you might as well dump the lousy sitters as soon as you find out about them and start looking for a better one.|`|bMyq2nOTaa	I don't have babysitters, but if I did, and I thought they didn't like my children, they wouldn't be their babysitter!|`|9b0a04d9a5a6e39d0997d773f7b49e09aa	get a different babysitter
CdJtH0xdaa	I'm a teenaged father, but I know some upsides to being a teenaged parent, if you'd like to hear the upsides, even though they're coming from a teenaged father. I will be able to relate more to my son, because I am a teenager, and will be younger when he grows older. I'll be able to understand his difficulties when he's a teenager or younger more, and I'll be able to interact with him more.|`|r39EDGhPaa	They can "relate" better because they are younger.<br>  Which, IMO, is bullshit.  A 30 year old woman could relate just fine to her 8 year old.  <br>  <br>  There are no advantages to being a teen mother or father.  Your age doesn't make it any better than if you were in your 20s when you gave birth.  You get to raise a baby who will love you unconditionally, your age doesn't change that.  Being younger when your child gets older, doesn't make it better.|`|m5Qh7gYraa	Your car insurance is lower because your deemed more responsible than a teen that didn't have a baby.<br>  That's what they told my mom when she went to get new car insurance.<br>  That if me or my sister had a baby are insurance would be lower because were more responsible.|`|vOFdHvlvaa	I think there are def. advantages to be a teen parent (not just mother). 1. Teens or young adults have alot more energy (most of the time anyways) than older parents so they can run around after there kids easier.<br>  2. They will more likely be around to see there great grandchildren then parents who had there kids older (and also be able to possiably even help out with them, cuz u'd prolly be in better health).<br>  3. For some teens or young adults it helps to to learn responsiblity, which IMO is a very good thing, course that's not gonna be all teen or young parents or even all parents in general.  And learnin responsiblity early on can help u to not make really bad mistakes like partyin hard, doing drugs, and stuff like that.<br>  4. I think that it's easier to relate to ur child since ur closer in age, and remember more what it was like to be young.<br>  5. Plus havin someone to love u as only a child can there parents is the best feeling in the world, and i think for teens that can help raise there self esteem, and i know when people see me with my son, and are impressed at how good of a parent i am it makes me feel wonderful.<br>  I've sure there are other advantages as well, but can't think of any at the moment.|`|NAzAmFDnaa	The only one I can think of is that you will be young when you become a grandmother.  Probably very young if the baby takes after the teen mom and also has a child in their teens.|`|U6C4Bywwaa	I had my first child at 19 and I would say that there are no advantages. ?|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	there are none  .they are dis/advantage ,, never get ahead,,|`|eC1Jiqhtaa	Well both of my parents were 15 years old and freshman in high school when I was born. They were definitely not expecting me but both (including my dad) stayed together and decided to keep me. Now I am 15 years old and they are 30 and they can understand every thing that I am going through at my age. But my mom said that the advantages were that she learned how to be a more responsible person, she and my dad learned how to provide for me and themselves, and the oppotunity to be closer to one another. Most likely if I weren't born they would have broke up as strange as that sounds. Oh and as my mom has said before she gets to be the "hot young mom" at all of my school events.|`|Vv6Dg6Q0aa	Nope.<br>  <br>  Oh, wait.<br>  Yes, you can get welfare,sting off your parents for anything, and have an excuse to ''prove'' that you're ''mature''.<br>  <br>  But that's about it.|`|BUdZWyjdaa	....The Beauty && The Magic of a new life that U, not anyone else, brought into this world.

j2mRop0laa	How humiliating!<br>  <br>  Absolutely cruel. Where is the effing PTO money and school allowence going? Where is it going, seriously???<br>  I'm mortified by this. I see so many kids at our school, parents losing jobs etc. What if they get behind? I'm so flabbergasted.<br>  <br>  I KNOW schools have the money to feed these children. I know for 100% FACT that if these school districts didn't blow the money on whatever it is getting blown on and covered up (I use to be on the PTO but not anymore because I see how greedy it has become and I'm disgusted) and then the CHILDREN suffer because they can't give them the same lunch. It's just begging to have those children picked on.<br>  <br>  Some parents don;t care if their kids have that stigma. That's the thing. Some of those parents will tell their kids to suck it up. WHY is it the KIDS fault if the parent won't pay?|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	I think it's inappropriate for the school district to punish a child for their parents actions (or, in this case inaction). I know when I was in elementary school they would give peanut butter and jelly to kids who had hot lunch debt. It's embarrassing for the child because this isnt' something they can control, and their whole class can now see that this kid is "poor". Not only that, but it's dangerous to not feed a child for a six to eight hour school day, teachers complain daily about kids who don't pay attention or are angry and disruptive... all those things are exacerbated in a child with low blood sugar who is having stomach cramps from hunger and is headachy and dizzy. I don't know where schools get off treating the students they way some of them do. At least some school districts are giving them something... a cheese sandwich, fruit and milk is better than some of the normal hot lunches I've seen. But, my opinion is that schools shouldn't not be allowed, legally, to punish the students for what their parent's are or are not doing for them. That's what conferences and phone calls are for.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	i think is fair.  I will only think it is cruel if they don't give them anything to eat.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	school lunches are funded by the FDA|`|jLYTKr33aa	It's not cruel.  After all, they aren't required to feed the children.  There are some schools that just let kids go hungry if they can't pay.  At least they aren't letting the kids starve.<br>  At the same time, they could do it more discretely.  I think pulling the kids out of line is terrible.  Instead, the lunch staff could have the teachers give the child and/or parents a note telling them that the child will have to have the free lunch until the bill is paid.  Also, there are other  low - cost options that a child could have so that they have more of a variety.  Peanut butter and jelly, for example, is cheap and nutritious.  Or why can't they at least cook the sandwiches, so the children get a hot lunch?  It's really not going to cost much more to heat the food.  While the schools shouldn't have to keep giving lunches of choice to families who don't pay their bills, they can give the children a healthy, low - cost meal without making it seem like they're punishing them for their parents' inability/unwillingness to pay.|`|AA10648704	The parents are given several notices before the kids are given cheese sandwiches.  If they don't want the "stigma" of being given a cheese sandwich, why not either pay their bill, or if they can't, pack a lunch?  The kids don't have to eat lunches provided by the school.  I have many memories of eating PBJ's for lunch when I was in school.|`|sBHhnDwaaa	Eh, my high school did it, because soooo many people kept having like $30 in unpaid debt. I think they just told you to bring money or you had X days until you got the PB&J (high school when they started this, so not sure about younger grades, and the sandwiches were those frozen crust less ones.)<br>  <br>  Its not fair to those who normally DO have the money and something happens (Mom has a baby, death, sickness, etc). BUT its fair to those who habitually don't pay....|`|QveBSjFSaa	Having worked as a recreational aide for the school district, what is appalling is how much food gets thrown away during lunchtime, and the free/reduced meal kids seem to be the biggest offenders.<br>  I personally have never known the kids to single each other out based on who was eating what, so I don't see where the sense of embarrassment would come from.<br>  I think it's more than fair.At a bar, if a tab is unpaid, your beverages get cut off. Here in the schools, if there is an unpaid tab, your child gets to eat anyway. Sounds good to me.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	My school serves peanut butter and jelly. I think that it is fine. The parents don't seem to be concerned if their kids eat or not and the school is making sure that they are fed. The kids that are on free or reduced lunch in our school cannot be told apart from the ones that pay anymore.  Quite a bit of parents do not bother in our school and that was long before the economy turned the way it is. I am sure that it is worse. They still seem to have their cigarettes and their trips out to the bar.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	honestly, at my old school if you didn't have the money or you owed money, you didn't eat. period. no ifs ands or buts about it.. there was no courtesy lunch.. none of that.<br>  <br>  you either had the money or you didn't. <br>  <br>  it seems cruel... but its fair.. schools don't have enough money to feed every child for free. <br>  <br>  at least with the cheese sandwiches they are getting some kind of nutrition.. and thats better than nothing at all.|`|zATQaiwIaa	i actually just read this story....I think it is very fair!  At least the kids are getting something!|`|rSWX0CZ7aa	It's not cruel as long as they make it edible.  When I was in elementary school they used to give you a peanut butter sandwich made with gooey, practically liquidy peanut butter.  All of us kids thought that they were purposely punishing us for not having money. lol.  (And seriously, how hard is it to just use peanut butter that hasn't passed its expiration date?  We weren't a poor school either.) So as long as they use good cheese that isn't 10 years old on the sandwiches, I don't see how it's cruel.  It would be a lot worse if they didn't give them any food at all and let them go hungry.  But really, something needed to be done about those peanut butter sandwiches because to this day I still feel sick thinking about it, even though luckily I always had my money and never was unfortunate enough to have to eat one!|`|OUBuIKDMaa	Cruel? It is GENEROUS of schoools to provide free food for children. Back when I was going to school you either brought a lunch from home, bought a hot lunch or you went without. Parents these days are oversensitive, and that oversensitivity rubs off on the children they raise which, in turn, severely hinders their ablity to deal with the real world when they get older. Poverty is something our government should be taking care of;  not our school districts.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	When i was in school if you were 20 or 30 dollars over you would get a curtsy lunch and it was a peanut butter sandwich and a milk and that's it. My friends would share with who ever didn't get a real lunch but i think its better then sending the kid away hungry. I dont think its the kids fault that there parents are giving them money for lunches so why make them suffer.|`|37dab5663389d7a1f34cbddd0a2bdab0aa	Absolutely fair! As the article said, some school districts won't even give children ANY food if they can't pay for it. At least these children are provided cheese sandwiches, fruit, and milk! That's a perfectly sound meal. Who could complain??? I mean, they are getting a good meal and for FREE to boot. Their parents should be thankful to the school for providing their kids a free meal. I mean, what would be better, letting the kids NOT eat? I think not!|`|FZEGM3ipaa	I think it's nice that they get to eat lunch, but humiliating for the child who has to eat a cheese sandwich next to all the other kids who get a hot lunch.  <br>  It is not the child's fault for a lazy parent who can afford the school lunch but doesn't pay.  Those parents should be ashamed.|`|wUooHVU3aa	definitely fair. My son's school does basically the same thing. Kids are never turned away for a meal, but if they have not paid they receive a PB&J, fruit, milk. <br>  <br>  Schools offer the discounted/free lunch to those who apply and qualify. So any parent who doesn't file the paperwork needs to provide lunch money for their kid(s). Plain and simple.|`|ZA5QTj3Zaa	I think it is fair.  They are getting food even though their parents aren't paying anything.<br>  <br>  Although it does single them out as "the cheese sandwich kids" to be ridiculed by peers.  Maybe switch it up so it isn't so noticeable.|`|M2yERqNSaa	its fair, parents should be able to afford their own spawn. no discounts for anyone|`|pnL5WTXMaa	more than fair -|`|0f2deb09ad21a9b193c5c032d99753f9aa	Smile, I agree with you 100%.  You may as well post a kick me sign on their backs.   I know schools are very underfunded there sometimes, but surely they could make food for the children a priority.  I know this is going to get me thumbs down, but I am really apalled at the US schooling system  I am from Canada, and my sister just moved there and I just find so many of the policies awful.  Some schools get so much funding, some schools get hardly any.  Some schools have all this fancy and unnecessary equipment (such as a big, electronic scoreboard for high school games????) and some schools can't afford anything.   People who live in poorer areas, get sent to the worst schools, no wonder the rich get richer and the poor get poorer... anyways off topic.   :)|`|s4LWmcTjaa	I think if the parents refuse to pay the bill for their kids' lunches, then it's more than fair.
h5cFkP35aa	i am assuming you had a positive pregnancy test to recieve an ultrasound. they had to do a vaginal ultrasound just to see anything in me. 7 weeks is very early, so just give it some time and request another ultrasound.|`|OODwlmKJaa	You didn't indicate whether you had a positive pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  I'm a little confused by your question.<br>  <br>  I've known several people who, for various reasons, had vaginal ultrasounds at five and six weeks, but if you actually are pregnant than it's possible that, because of the early stage of pregnancy you're in, the ultrasound isn't showing correctly.<br>  <br>  Have you had any bleeding at all? Spotting?|`|LUR9MVaiaa	I'm sorry but there is no way it was too early. you should have seen something about the size of a gummi bear with lil arm and leg buds if you were pregnant. <br>  <br>  There is something called a blighted ovum where ur egg is fertilized but the embryo fails to develop, in otherwords you have an empty amniotic sac. <br>  <br>  Take a home pregnancy test it would be VERY accurate if you're 7 1/2 weeks along, if it's positive then call ur ob/gyn back and tell them they should be able to let you know of support groups and counseling if you do have a blighted ovum.<br>  <br>  Sry i couldnt help more and it's a rough situation. Hope all turns out well.|`|vEBfp8yHaa	It's not likely that they would miss it.  But if you're sure you're preggers then get a blood test at your gyno's - that test never lies. That line down the middle doesn't appear till MUCH later on in pregnancy.  Pregnancy is not the only thing that could explain what's going on w/ u - you could have some kind of problem w/ your cervix or uterus - perhaps a urinary tract infection - get checked out by your doc RIGHT NOW!|`|l4lHSn1uaa	I have heard of early ultrasounds being harder to see clearly, but I'm not an ultrasound tech so I couldnt really determine if there was anything or not. <br>  <br>  Have you tried taking a pregnancy test? <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck. <br>  <br>  and ps. If you are pregnant, they'll record by the first day of your last period. Wgich would have you at 9 weeks tomorrow. =]|`|15bfbee9158c1901c31e1158ebf6bd03aa	I hate to say this. I had the same problem. It turned out to be an ectopic pregnancy. I hope this isn't the case for you and that it is something else, but you may want to bring it up to your doctor as a possibility to look for. You DO NOT want your tube to rupture.|`|Dr3qvf3Kaa	it def. is possible to see that baby that early... but it is also possible that the baby isn;t in the right position to be seen yet.. did u go to the hospital and get blood work done to see if u are pregnant???|`|XVljoYZ5aa	It may just be wishful thinking, sorry hun. Its highly unlikely they just couldn't see a baby. Keep getting tests, maybe thyroid issues?? Also if you're convinced, take a HPT.|`|LY2LSzPJaa	what did the test say? HPT ? <br>  Doctor didnt explain why they did not see anything?<br>  Get blood test done!<br>  I hope you are too hun good luck|`|pcR7XCJsaa	Yes, If you had a Trans-vag ultrasound and you are 7 1/2 weeks pregnant, they could definitely see whats going on in there. 7 1/2 weeks isn't too early at all. They could see and measure your baby's heart beat as well as measure the size of the baby to better determine a date of conception. You would be able to make out features such as your baby's spine. It is too early to determine things like the sex of your baby though. One thing you said is that you have fevers..and that isn't necessarily a symptom of pregnancy. Be sure to mention that to your doctor.|`|toLCaFc9aa	It would show on the ultrasound. If not, check the doctor, because maybe you have other things going on. Good luck|`|cf217a7ce3f072b96b3827b9fa9b820faa	it normally takes 4-5 months to know the sex of the baby... All of the things you are experiencing are thejoys of being pregnant|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	By 7 1/2 weeks they should have seen at least a sac. Sorry, but it doesn't sound too hopeful. :(<br>  They saw my sac and fetal pole when I was 5 weeks 4 days.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	they would have seen something.|`|QYYWBrG7aa	at 7 1/2 weeks they should have seen "something"!|`|P1xlrvAaaa	Have you had a + HPT,also a + blood test?If you did then it is possible that you are pregnant just not as far along as you thought but even at 7 1/2 weeks they should have been able to see a sak and fetal pole.I am sorry but it isn't looking good.If you have been TTC for awhile you may have thought you were pregnant and now convinced yourself that could be why you have symptoms.I am sorry.Good luck!!!!|`|tmh42R6Caa	I had an ultrasound at 5 weeks and they could only see the yolk sac.  The ultasound tech even said, "Are you sure you're pregnant?"  That was devistating!  I would take a pregnancy test to be sure.  At this point, it would be more exact than an ultrasound.|`|hoX7hoINaa	Only would've seen the yolk sac and baby would look like a little peanut. You wont see an actual baby form until 20 weeks.|`|H0fXySX9aa	if you are 7 weeks then there would be a fetal pole heart beat and sac<br>  i had one at 6 weeks and there was a fetal pole and heart beat|`|LBg4DNpCaa	The doctor and I saw the baby at 6 weeks she was a little bean. So they def could seen it if you were.|`|VEkkn2Otaa	what do you mean they didnt see anything and why wouldnt your doctor of answered this question!|`|bWyKAFwuaa	They can see at 4 weeks, are you sure you are pregnant???|`|hIzQyflqaa	what do pregnancy tests say?
bMuwuAVOaa	I suppose it is better than to find the poor dear dead in a dumpster outside the school after prom night. It seems that the sexual active teen of this era has little or no morality about themselves. I pray for the youth of today. Peace&Love be with you...~M~|`|8dhe15MUaa	so so sad and some women want a baby and can not . what this world coming to i say .|`|1tmX7xbRaa	that's so sad...especially these days when all you have to do is drop the child at the hospital...they won't ask questions they wont charge you with any crime (at least in the us) but when you just leave a kid somewhere then get caught you get in trouble. people are stupid|`|xY1kohVRaa	Im not sure, there may have been many reasons this person could have been raped and thought it would go away, maybe she saw the baby and it reminded her, or something like that, its not our place to judge we do not know the situation.<br>  <br>  Why does everyone automatically think that the women that abandoned this baby is a teenager? It really winds me up, i have a cousin that is 17 and pregnant and shes doing really well for herself,<br>  this women could have been in her 40s.. age isn't always the reason!|`|P1xlrvAaaa	It is very sad but it is a better option then what some people do.Panic and throw baby in a dumpster,suffocate it,or cause deliberate harm,or abortion.At least this person had brains enough to place baby where people would find it right away.I am A HUGE believer in the "safe heaven"law.The babies get adopted by people who want them so badly.Good luck and have a good day!|`|gDEFlWnOaa	It's not better for it just to be "left" somewhere- you can drop the baby off at a hospital, or police station, no questions ask. But to just leave it on a door step is ridiculous and completely wrong. Anything can happen to it.|`|ZicqULySaa	It's sad I agree, A parent doesn't want the child so they abandon it in hopes that others will care for it. Sadly I do think leaving a child on a doorstep is better than ...say that one case I heard about a baby only a few hours old abandoned in a field and rescued by that dog. Or much much better than what Casey Anthony did when she didn't want her child anymore.<br>  <br>  No matter what horrible thing I hear on the news I try not to think of the truth that there's something even worse going on in the world (whether it's reported or not)|`|oHvmqpxmaa	It's sad, but it's for the best.<br>  <br>  I would rather have a baby abandoned and found and given<br>  a chance to lead a happy life with someone else than to <br>  be killed or abused and neglected.<br>  <br>  That's what happens when babies are born to those that are <br>  unfit for parenthood or just shady people in general.|`|s8VY7uReaa	its pure evil. Alot of women out there are praying to have babies and then theres women who abandon at door steps...i mean drop the baby at some adoption centre...not outside in the cold!!!!imagine the poor baby wasnt found...she would have died. people can be so cruel.|`|BPDXR0GJaa	Their parents may not want them because they are not matured to look after them so, to avoid being stressed to look after the child, the best way is to dump them like cabbage.
oWAUb6vpaa	Looks like your doctor forgot about it (which is not very responsible of him or her.) Yes, you are supposed to fast (no food or drink before this test, which will take about an hour.) <br>  <br>  I was so upset when my ob forgot about it, too. I switched to someone else because I no longer trusted her, (there were some other small things that bothered me as well, but for a test that important, I felt she put herself over my limit.) <br>  <br>  What I ended up doing was calling the doctor's office and reminding them about the screening and they added it into my appointment, but this was something the ob should have done with out me asking - it's thier job! <br>  <br>  Call the office, luv. Good luck and congratulations!|`|yrF1q1mdaa	they didn't tell me until I was at my doctor's appointment that they were doing it but its not that big of deal. my grandfather, dad, and 17 year old brother all have diabetes so they definitely wanted to check me. They said it didn't matter if you had eaten or not because it doesn't effect how well your body deals with it either way. the drink isn't bad either, it tastes like sierra mist but I have heard that if you do meet that higher standard in your blood sugar and have to take the longer 3 hour test that the coke like drink they give you is awful, lol. I thank god didn't have it so I didn't have to take that test. Good Luck!|`|3K7ffKn2aa	my doc told me at the apt that i needed to do one (either that day or sometimes within the week). And she didn't tell me not to eat anything, you just can't eat once you take the test. However when i had to go back and retest they told me not to eat 8 hours before. <br>  <br>  p.s. the drink isn't that bad, i had the orange.|`|R7U1sDd1aa	I'm 21 weeks along with my first baby, a boy, and at my last ob appt. @ 19 weeks, my ob told me that they will do that test in two more appt's. I go every 4 weeks, sooo that would be at 27-28 wks. I'm not sure though if every ob does it at the same time. You would think they would though.|`|sIr2fWh6aa	They tell you in advanced.  You cannot eat or drink anything (except plain water--no flavoring) after midnight..  They'll have you drink this stuff, then wait an hour (no water, smoking, food, nothing) then they'll draw your blood.|`|LY2LSzPJaa	YOu are not suppose to eat or drink anything before it , as far as when they test I do not remember but I remember is was towards the end kind of<br>  good luck , call you doc's office and ask !|`|VEkkn2Otaa	That test sucks I am sure they will make you do it next time, mine told me to eat just not really sugary foods.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Ask about it at your next appointment...|`|4GwTDea1aa	Most likely they will let you know at your next visit, but i was told in advance! And your not supposed to eat anything before and only small amounts of water.. Would get too excited for it though you have to drink some really really sweet drink! BLAH|`|kHk8rS5Xaa	i had my at 28 weeks...they gave me a piece of paper with information on it and it said you can't eat or drink anything before your test..|`|em8A42Bqaa	You will probably be told next time.  I think I was about 27 weeks or so when I did mine|`|g9ZFjl6paa	The paper the doctors office gives you does NOT tell you that you cant eat or drink before the appointment. once you do drink the stuff they give you then they don't want you to eat anything or drink anything but water. they should have you do it at your next appointment. if not just ask or tell them you haven't done it yet.<br>  <br>  edit: to sudouga and numb2 i dont know what kinda doctors office you went to but i was told i could eat before my appointment and did and everything came out fine. they just dont want you to eat after you drink the stuff they give you.|`|WvWFmwQoaa	yeah i had that glucose test at around 27 - 30 weeks and my mid wife is the one who told me about it not my doctor, you should ask your mid wife if you don't have one then you should definitely ask your doc it is important to have one done so that if you have pregnancy diabetes then they know about it so they can treat you better during labour.<br>  just ask either one just say that your friend had one and she was talking about it so you were wondering if you were suppose to have one lol if your scared to fix them because they may of forgot lol im like that i want them to remember and tell me not me tell them lol but just ask them anyway its better for you...<br>  yes you do have to fast for like 14 hours or something i had the very big one because im in high risk of it in my family but i think the normal low risk is different but they will tell you or give you info about it when you book in for it.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	why dont you call your doctor and ask<br>  <br>  for the first glucose test you dont need to fast<br>  <br>  if your results are abnormal - higher or lower than standard amount<br>  you will do the 3 hr glucose test - for this one you will need to fast (8-10 hrs) before test.<br>  <br>  at least thats what my doctor told me.|`|QYYWBrG7aa	I never thought i was gonna get mine done but she finally told me i was gonna have it done.She told me i could eat and drank before it but after i drunk the drank i couldnt eat or drank anything!I passed mine with flying colors.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	they usually tell you in advance.. give them a call and find out.

vue9NOhYaa	You mean finger foods?<br>  <br>  Fruits<br>  Veggies (cooked)<br>  pasta<br>  rice<br>  cheese<br>  egg (yolk only  if you're concerned about allergy)<br>  cheerios<br>  puffs<br>  <br>  (He doesn't need teeth. He will gum up soft foods until he gets molars.)<br>  <br>  EDIT: Even if you're asking about purees, you DON'T have to start a 7 month old (or any baby) with rice cereal.  That's just silly.|`|FXINmF6saa	I would recommend to give him steamed soft veggies or banana straight from the peal. That's if he doesn't want puree that much but if he'll take it then give him Gerber like veggies or banana and apple. You could also try buying him some Gerber fruit puffs. They are finger food that have a light taste of fruit. They're stars and are perfectly good for kids even if they don't have teeth because they dissolve easily when you get them. I started giving them to my son when he was really young because he started eating really early. Now he's 1 and he still loves them. Just make sure you only give him a couple not allot because they might get stuck in his tummy and get constipated since he's not use to them. They're a good snack though. Good Luck!|`|52bAHCaUaa	I would start with stage 1 foods. Just make sure you only give him 1 kind for a couple days, then another kind, and so on. In case he has a reaction to a certain type of food, you can narrow it down better that way.<br>  <br>  I started my daughter on carrots, then bananas neither she cared for. She kind of like applesauce...but I don't think shes completely ready. So we stopped and are going to try again in a week or so!<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~<br>  I love thumbs down! Sorry I missed part of the question! <br>  My daughter hasn't had any finger foods yet..so I am no help!|`|mvqfIjEVaa	Rule of thumb is to start with rice cereal.  Then you can try oatmeal or barley cereal.  After that you can go to veggies then fruit.  Lighter colored veggies first.  Try only one type of food at a time for a week just to be safe and make sure your baby isn't allergic.|`|3vzxSKLcaa	Bananas, peas, carrots, green beans, sweet potatoes, applesauce, pears.|`|EqxxXrvLaa	For your 7 month old you should NEVER feed them dairy. So cheese is out of the question.<br>  <br>   Always start with vegetables first. Try Carrots, peas, butternut squash, and potatoes (plain).<br>  Introduce something new every two days. If you have a 48 hour waiting period so you can see if your child has an allergy to the specific food.<br>   After all that you can introduce fruit for breakfast then after dinner.<br>  Talk to your pediatrician she/he will be able to better direct you in the proper feeding for your infant.<br>   *** most doctors will agree that dairy should never be introduced until they are a year old.|`|mO2oOqZ3aa	cheerios, Gerber puffs, both practically just disolve in their mouth, Before my son had teeth i gave him baby yogurt, past (elbows cut in half) and small peices of soft cooked hamburg, he did fine.

When my son was young, he was in daycare and has been really most of his life because I was a single mother.  I suffered a work injury last year and had a spinal surgery so now I am out of work and have more time with my son, he's 3 1/2 now.  All that time in school really benefited him because of the socialization, I also think your son who you home schooled will benefit from the one on one education yuo recieved.  So what I am saying is i think both of your children got unique and benefitial schooling.  Your son shouldn't have trouble getting into school, there is no reason, there are many mothers who only homeschool for a while and then send the kids to school.  My cousin has done it with all 4 of her children and they are all know in school just as easily as the children who were not home schooled.  As long as you have the necessary credits taht were needed to prove that the schooling was legitimate and they may do testing to make sure he or she is up to the grade level.  Otherwise no worries!  Good luck and keep your head up the economy will get better.

And its not always the sign you are ovulating if you see stretchy mucus. best to do a test to see if you are ovulating. baby dust to you|`|0KGriIC7aa	from what i have read you have 24 to 48 hours to become prego. so as soon as possibles and as much as possible.|`|vigFmfLmaa	That ewcm means you are to ovulate soon (probably).  You should have sex as soon as possible and for the next few days until after you ovulate.
8kO43YGYaa	no i had it before and had a baby girl it is scary im now 6 weeks 3 days and was cramping really bad last week|`|ApyrV5J9aa	I am 12 weeks pregnant and I have cramped on and off since implantation. My doctor and my research says that it is completely normal and no sign of an impending miscarriage unless there are other problems as well, such as bleeding a lot. I work at the hospital so I have had 6 ultrasounds done already and my baby is doing perfectly well. I was having cramping last weekend and the ultrasound tech could see that I was having minor and safe contractions, causing the cramping. Early on it was because my uterus was expanding. So no, cramping does not necessarily mean that the pregnancy will end in miscarriage.|`|tdNfQWaAaa	I have heard that it is VERY normal to cramp from ovulation for a few weeks. They say its from the baby implanting itself in the uterus and your insides are starting to stretch to make room for the baby. But it is something to watch, if they cramps get to severe or you start bleeding, go to the doctor as soon as you can.. Best of luck!!! xxxx|`|YLXpwqceaa	My miscarriage ended at 8 weeks, and I started cramping at 7 weeks.  Not after ovulation.|`|FYDw1rjlaa	Yes and no because it depends but most of time it end in miscarriage. For me it was different. When I have my second baby, I was having cramps and spotting a little so I call my doctor. I went to the clinic to get my blood drawn every two days to check if the HCG level goes up. If it keep ongoing up then that's a really good sign. I went until my HCG level got to 2000 and have a ultrasound to check on my baby. Thank God, my baby was in my uterus and everything turn out fine and she was born healthy.|`|DgqjjJqJaa	I always had a stretching feeling in my stomach, which I'm pretty sure is normal because I think its just my body trying to make room for growth. But I didnt start truly cramping until a few days before I miscarried at 8 weeks. But I was under a lot of stress.|`|8RfmosODaa	I dont remember with my first but this past time I was preggo  I had cramping and then sadly miscarried at 6 weeks. I know that cramping is normal, your uterus is stretching and growing to make room for baby. As long as you have no bleeding everything is ok. When I actually miscarried I had NO cramps, just a good bit of blood.|`|smsUZG4Iaa	cramping in early pregnancy is very common. normally the reason you have cramping is because the ovum is burrowing into the lining of your uterus.. it perfectly normal.. if you start to have any bleeding you should then call your doctor..

uuHPneEcaa	if u go to plan parenthood they should be able to give u a list of places that can assist u with ur child.

WIC is the only one I know of here but that's a good question. Made me want to look it up. If I find something, I'll be sure to post it.. (Or hopefully there's someone out there who's answering this question as we speak, but like I said, I haven't heard of any other ones.)|`|h5cFkP35aa	i am in florida also and WIC is a good program. you could also qualify for government benefits (if you need them) which would help with food, housing, money, etc. also, there is a program i went through a christian agency that provided counseling, maternity clothes, and other things for baby. good luck.
IlyS8KGzaa	Sure it's possible.  I think that is awesome.  You can put any name you want to on the birth certificate.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Of course. You can use whatever name you would like to.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	You can give the baby any last name you choose, or no last name at all, the USA has no laws saying what the last name has to be.
IuJjYz6gaa	You are 24 weeks.  At this point is it VERY risky to let anything go on that could be premature labor.<br>  <br>  Premature labor doesn't have to feel like normal labor.<br>  <br>  If it were me, I would go to the hospital and get checked out.  If you are dialating, the earlier you go in the better your chances are to stop this.|`|PYtJ2GoFaa	Go back to the doctor. Who cares if it ends up being something small or nothing at all. You and your baby's well being is most important. <br>  <br>  If you don’t want to go just yet, go for a walk with someone. You don’t have to go far, just up and down the street a few times.  If it is BH contractions then the walk should make them go away. In addition, drink lots of fluids, even some Gatorade would be okay. If after that it has not gotten better, go see the doctor. It could be pre-term labor in which case it is very serious and they might put you on bed rest. Good luck and take care.|`|FfxgHWGxaa	if i were u i wouldn't even wait to be honest with u. If you feel really bad i would just go straight to hospital, just say you leave it 2 late and something happens(touch wood it doesn't) u would be in the safest place. Good luck 2 u xx

qSmCA82Aaa	I don't even know where to begin really.  This woman blows my mind.  I can't believe they are being evicted yet she had money to do the implantation AND get plastic surgery.   I am married to a very helpful husband and we both work and our 3 children are a handful I couldn't even begin to imagine having 14!  We manage but never would I be able to afford plastic surgery!  I think this woman priorities are seriously messed up.  Even if I was rich I wouldn't have 14 kids and certainatly not 8 at once.   I want to be there for my children and raise them and show them MY love and affection.  There is no possible way that this woman can give 14 kids the time and attention that children need,   If she does get to keep them it will turn into her older children helping to raise the younger ones which will completly take away thier childhoods.  It's not fair to anyone involved.  Sad, sad story-----For the children not her!<br>  <br>  Edit to Panda Bear:  I have to disagree with some of what you said.  Yes you are correct that they're are alot of single mothers on welfare (I use to be one of them)  But at the same time those single mothers aren't going and paying to have 6 eggs implanted into them while they already have 6 young children at home.  Those single mothers are also not out getting plastic surgery OR getting thier nails done right after they had babies that were still in NICU.  While I do understand she is doing interviews to make whatever money she can you have to wonder what she is doing with that.  It was reported on a news channel not tabloid that she was out shopping for houses around the 1 million dollar range.  Does that not make you wonder.   I don't see how this woman can be getting evicted, recieving food stamps, medical care and whatever else she gets yet have the money for stuff like a nails, new house, etc.    And yes that is the part that irritates me.  I have no problam whats-so-ever with people recieving government help like I said I use too also but I do have a problem with people recieving it when My husband works 12 hours a day and I work also just to get by and we harldy ever have any spending money and I would never in my life be out shopping for a million dollar home!|`|b180facdedcb15658b8368bdeae5b655aa	I think she's a lieing idiot. She keeps talking about making sure her 6 kids are taken care of..yeah by taxpayers. She doesn't want to cause them emotional harm. Is she kidding? She wants nothing but the fame?<br>  She supposedly got hurt while working at a mental health hospital. I question if she wasn't a patient there? She avoids every question and beats around the bush answering it. She's psycho.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	This is a shame... the poor kids... its all about them and no one is giving them a million dollars for interviews... ah maybe cause the oldest 3 cant speak since they are autistic and have delays... too sad... the world is a sad place.|`|Sk6lrUeXaa	According to foxnews.com, she has also just received an offer of $1 million to perform in a porno.<br>  <br>  This story just keeps getting more interesting.|`|wUooHVU3aa	I can't tell who is the bigger media wh&%$ ...<br>  the octo mom<br>  or Dr. Phil|`|uuBeS7z5aa	i hate dr phil and i hate octo pu s s y.|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	I have been covering her story through the "Today" show in the morning. I think she wanted fame and fortune and figured this was the easiest way for her to do that. She already was in way over her head. <br>  <br>  I also blame society for a little bit of her problem. It really is no wonder that someone has done this. Watching shows like, 17 and counting and John and Kate Plus 8 gives people ideas. They are all shown to be living well with lots of kids. I'm sure she sees this and thinks...I could get a tv deal to if I mass produced kids and I am single.|`|TQW5E6olaa	I stand by my gut reaction to the first time I heard of her, she's not all there.|`|zQWNb6neaa	Now I am watching the Dr. Phil show- for the first time- thanks to this question. I was already convinced she is out there, I doubt this interview will change my mind.  Now, if you will excuse me, I have some Octo momma drama to watch ;).<br>  <br>  35 min into the show: She seems a bit deluded and horrifyingly nonchalant. How can she say that her children will not suffer from her being divided in 14 different directions with 14 children to care for? Yes, a parents love does expand the more children that they have, but their time, money, and attention doesn't.|`|5f6XnInEaa	Great question...I know it's over discussed, but I can't help myself.<br>  <br>  I just think this woman is a loser.<br>  Those poor babies don't have a chance, and I pray to God CPS gets involved.<br>  <br>  Your spot on, I think I said a similar thing before about her just being on TV all of the time, rather than with her babies.<br>  <br>  Probably because she's a lazy cow, who'd rather get money for all of the wrong reasons, rather than right.<br>  <br>  Why work when you can start of your own donation website?<br>  Lol.<br>  I just think this woman is not with it.<br>  <br>  She needs help, but not in the form of welfare checks.<br>  <br>  She seriously needs some psychological help.|`|f55619778e2c4f36156e3d1508aa6431aa	I haven't seen the show but her parents help her a lot with child care of her first 6 children.   Grandma is a retired teacher and her retirement checks are going to her forever growing number of grandchildren.    Grandpa could have retired by now but he will continue to work as long as he able so he can care for Nadya's children.   I find it unbelievable that a woman will dump so much her parenting responsibilities onto the grandparents.   These grandparents were very upset over this last pregnancy.   They are actually divorced but came together as grandparents to care for tham all.   So how does Nadya show her gratitude?   She gives them 8 more newborns to help care for.   Is she trying to give them a heart attack?   Does she worry about much of a toll this can on their health?   She is EXTREMELY selfish.   Never in my wildest dreams could I have done something like this to my aging parents.|`|s6emVQleaa	I really, really don't think she was planning on having 8 babies.  IVF is not that successful that you could ever assume that would happen.  Of course there is a possibility, but it's on the scope of 1 in multi, multi million.  Why would she have them all transferred?  I wouldn't do it but I understand her reasoning.  1.  If that was the protocol that her doctor used before (transferring 6) even though it isn't the standard, it did produce at the most twins in her previous pregnancies 2. Cost vary by clinic, but the frozen embryo transfer I am going through costs about $3000 each time so I can see why she wouldn't want to do it again.  3. Leftover embryos have only three options, you use them, they get destroyed or you adopt them out.  I am morally opposed to destroying mine and I don't feel comfortable adopting them out, so I will use them all.  <br>  "She said she just wanted one more.... ok so implant two maybe three eggs. She didn't need to implant all six of them. That to me says this didn't happen by chance."  Just to repeat again, the success rate of frozen embryo transfers is fairly low (varies by clinic and age but about 25%)- you cannot force the embryo to implant once it has been transferred, so it's really not something that you have the foresight to do it intentionally.<br>  <br>  *one more addition to my soapbox: Infertile people have the right to as many children as fertile people.  I don't think that 8 at once is a great idea, but I'm not about to crucify her because she wanted another baby.  There are plenty of other mother's who are in poor economic conditions and no one is making a fuss over how many kids they have.  It's just when you start talking about infertility treatments, there are a whole lot of opinions that people start having over a subject you have no way to understand until you face it yourself.|`|sxecXFgraa	I haven't seen the interview and don't plan on watching it.  I understand her saying she hated being pregnant.  I absolutely hated being pregnant with just one baby and I can only imagine what it's like to have 8 babies in you.  Don't get me wrong, I love my kids, but the pregnancy thing didn't work for me.  That doesn't make her out there.  As far as going to interviews, that's her way of getting money right now.  I know if one of my kids was in the hospital for an extended amount of time, I couldn't stay with them all the time without losing my job (and there goes my health insurance).  In cases of multiple births like this, the hospital won't release the babies until proper care has been set up at the home, the hospital just isn't doing this to Nadya.  Until she proves that she cannot take care of the kids, the kids should eventually released to her.<br>  <br>  I think she's more worried that public opinion is going to influence the decision to not release the babies to her.  People were screaming the week the babies were born that she was unfit.  There are plenty of non-working single parents on welfare but yet she was considered unfit and mental for undergoing IVF.  Most people don't really know what is going on in her life and believe whatever the latest tabloid gossip is.  <br>  <br>  She had six implanted each time she underwent IVF and only one took.  So I understand her thinking that only 1 of these 6 would take.  And who would of thought that 2 of them would split?  I know both times I got pregnant, the thought of twins didn't come to my mind.<br>  <br>  Lauren:  I know MSNBC changed their story on the million dollar house.  TMZ (a tabloid news show) first reported she was looking to buy a million dollar home and all of the other news channels ran with it.  And like they do with so many other things, they reported on it before they got all the facts.  Later it was discovered that she wasn't looking to buy the house, she showed up for a interview with the Dr. Phil show.  <br>  I seen lots of women using food stamps and living in section 8 homes that always have their hair and nails done.  And she has denies the plastic surgery.  I've seen the photos of the before and after but I know what I can do with Adobe Photoshop and I'm not expert on it.  She decided to get IVF again with her money.  That doesn't make her an unfit mom and doesn't warrent taking her kids away.
Jo2DfRzaaa	my personal observation/opinions aside - i can NOT agree to the govt or anyone else for that matter, investigating my home before i bring my children home.  children that i carried and gave birth too.  that is completely and totally ridiculous.  to have the govt or any other agency step in and dictate the financial abilities or not of a woman who has given birth and let that indicate the "fitness" of a parent is crap.  how can a hospital deny her, her children w/out just cause?  if she has done harm to her current children, fine that is btw her and the state, but to ASSUME that she is worthless is crap too.  <br>  i know what i THINK, but i don't have any power, you know.  just my opinions.  i can't do anything w/them.  people who have the power darn well better have more than just opinions before they take children from a mother.  they better be using the same standards they give everyone else, not go harder on her because her circumstances are so out there.<br>  i don't want or need the govt anywhere near my uterus.  it is my biz what goes on it and what comes out of it.  plain and simple<br>  i will now step down from my soap box.  :-)|`|sBHhnDwaaa	Geez, I'm glad I had Jamie now!! I would in no way pass, being a single 20 y/o living at home (and pregnancy hormones did NOT go well with me part of the time...).<br>  <br>  I have never heard of any of that, but do know in some states they have a safe haven law that you can drop a baby off between so many days....|`|AA12127693	It's my understanding that the state has stepped in because of her current living arrangements - a three bedroom house that she "shares" with her parents.  She currently has 6 children at home and is wanting to bring 8 more into it?  Where in the heck is she going to put all of them.  I think this woman is crazy and if I were her Mother - I don't know what I would do if I were this woman's Mother...she seriously needs mental help.  Asking for money on the internet and then getting photographed buying a Wii and accesories to boot!|`|7aCH91ISaa	I work for a housing program and deal with social workers on a regular bases. If they are aware that the parents are homeless, have inadequate housing or their current housing is substandard the hospital is required to notify CPS. <br>  <br>  When this nutcase, I mean Octo-mom, (Or grandma)  publicized that their home was inadequate they opened the door for CPS to step in and make sure the kids will have a safe home when they are released from the hospital. <br>  <br>  they won't be setting a precedence because this has always been the case. It has nothing to do with her financial status it has to do with her current housing conditions (OK, and maybe her mental health is an issue here).|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	The hospital can not and will not keep them indefinitely-either they will be released to their mother or to the Department of Child Welfare/Social Services.  Most likely to their mother, because no matter what her situation unless it is abuse or neglect they can not take the children.  There are, sadly, many people out there in the same or worse situation than she is in-they just do not make the news because they did not have eight babies at once.<br>  <br>  It is routine for parents in NICU to have to understand what their children need in terms of medical care before they are released from the NICU.  If she is unable to show that she can adequately do so, they will remain until she can-within reason, of course-then I assume that someone else woudl become involved.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	Shes coo coo for coco puffs. NO one raised a red flag about this women after the 3rd and 4th in vitro procedure. Or her 10,000$ plastic surgery. NO one stopped her from having more when her first 3 were deemed disabled. She didnt even stop. She decided to go on having more inferior babies... because simply put, she wanted too. She thinks shes making a good mom. A good mom thinks about her children before and after birth. She doesnt think about them shes a HORDER. IF these were animals, they would take them away and give her a fine or lock them up... The woman lives with her parents in a 3 bedroom house up for foreclosure. IF she didnt want the media attention then she should not have gone on being pregnant with 8. OF COURSE its her choice to do so but if you can not prove the ability to care for your children they SHOULD be taken away regardless of who you are and how many kids you have. These 8 were premature, they were from the same father and all had to be in NICU.... how many of THESE babies are going to be disabled and needing government care and extra care??? probably all and how is she going to care for them???? frankly this should never had happened.<br>  <br>  I agree the government should investigate thoroughly before making any decisions. Though when someone can not make the correct choices for the children's benefits, and are clearly of a deteriorated mental state, then SOME ONE has to think about what goes in or comes out of that nuts uterus.|`|gPg7qYGIaa	social work will be involved there must be something there worried about or maybe it just the fact one baby a lot of work 8 babes maybe require more than one carer|`|AA11783671	This is a great question!  My opinion is that people have messed in the story so much that people are actually questioning the hospital on this.  I have a feeling that there's pressure for them to check into her stability and ability to care for the kids, and of course, not wanting to look bad, they are.  I think this is a truly unique situation and should be handled as such.  I think that she should have a social worker assigned to her case and they could track her ability to care for her children.  Apparently she has done a decent job with her others and just like those people in Arkansas who have 18 kids, if she can take care of and provide for them, let it be.|`|FZEGM3ipaa	The home that she shares with her mother and children is about to be auctioned leaving them all without a place to live.  They are on all forms of welfare which doesn't come close to enough to raise a family of 16.  I think the fact that there is so much media attention is why social services has stepped in.  They are receiving death threats and that is not a safe environment for any child.  <br>  Personally, I think it's just another ploy to get people to send her money. I can't stand this woman for some reason and feel so bad for her kids.|`|tw1uePBbaa	i don't think this case is going to set a precedent for the future.  <br>  there have been other large sets of multiples born that have not had this kind of negative attention.   i also don't think this story became popular because we dug into it.  when she came out and started talking, that's when the real attention started.  she says she cant take care of them by herself-what does she want to happen here?  the state to pay for a nanny for her?  of course dhs is going to start watching and of course she is going to scrutinized..if she wasn't walking around with her hand out, most of this bad press wouldn't be happening-she should have thought of what she was doing when she did it.  she had no job prospects when she went in for treatment and certainly doesn't now either.  what kind of a mother has invitro when she is barely managing the children she had already?  shouldn't they have been her first priority-instead of her own selfish want to procreate??
s4LWmcTjaa	I believe that the hospital is doing what they feel is in the best interest of the babies.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry but a single, unemployed mom who already has six kids (three of which have some form of disability) and then she allows the remainder of her eggs to be implanted inside her knowing she cannot even provide for the children she already has, she does not need nor do I believe she is capable of handling eight newborns on top of her six other kids.<br>  <br>  Remember Kate Gosslen?  She had 50+ people a week to help her.  Over 30,000 diapers a week for her six babies.  She could bring her kids home to a home that was hers.  She had the means to care for those babies.<br>  <br>  Nadya has no means to care for these babies.  Hospitals will deny a parent the right to take home their child if they believe it's in the best interest and physical or mental well being of the child.  I think this is no different.  I believe it's in the best interest and in the well being of those babies that they are placed with capable parents who can provide for them and give them the attention and time that is required.<br>  <br>  I agree with the hospital's threat.  I also believe that social services plays a role in the hospital's decision.  This woman is reaping what she has sown.<br>  <br>  Also keep in mind this is not your typical case of multiple births.  This is beyond what is considered normal or typical circumstances.
BnX2c7aNaa	It could be from a dietary inbalance, but I doubt a growth spurt. Probably you're diet. you need more vitamins. Eat more fruit this week.
rR4q2e9qaa	I had breastmilk in storage bags in the freezer, and I would just grab one and it slowly melted, and when my baby was ready to eat I would just unthaw the rest under warm water, then pour it in the bottle.|`|6hrpoVUZaa	If you feel uncomfortable nursing in public (which you shouldn't:) ), breastmilk is good for 4 hours at room temperature. That doesn't mean 80 degrees. You can just buy a small cooler if it's hot out, or keep it in a thermos if it's cold and pour it in bottles. But remember, milk from the breast is always perfect temp:)|`|4c37af8f5ace80a9c4a1a84872ff8068aa	those cooler bags. you can get them online, or argos.<br>  <br>  and get some ice packs (there blue block things that you freeze or cool so things stay cooler for longer) and then you can get the milk warmed up in a cafe or somewere.|`|5apGkgS9aa	in your breasts....why use bottles?|`|7hTFflJ3aa	what I do is warm one bottle before we go and put it in a small bottle cooler kinda thing. (I got it free from the hospital). Then I keep one or two refigerater bottles with an ice pack in another small cooler. If the warm one is used within 4 hours you are fine. Note the bottle is not HOT, just warmed to room temp from the fridge. The other two can keep for days as long as they are kept cold. Then dad can warm under tap water if needed. We arent usually gone long enough to use a second bottle, but the one time we were, we were at a resturant and I asked the waitress for some hot water in a cup and they did that for us.|`|077c6d4e4b9978f72bfc78160c727f2aaa	Breast milk stays at room temp for something like 9 hours but I would put it in fridge and have your hubby warm it in a cup of warm water. If it is for a later date freeze it in plastic breastmilk bags and thaw as needed in fridge or warm water.  Just know that once thawed it is literally only good for 24 hours.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I would just go to the store and get a cooler and a warmer.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	The easiest and most simple way is to store the milk in your body, works like a charm.
smsUZG4Iaa	its quite possible to have implantation cramping right now.. you might even experience some light bleeding.. your just gonna have to wait and see.. Best of Luck|`|tdNfQWaAaa	I'm in the exact same boat  as you are! I was supposed to ovulate on the 21st. I think it might have been even a day or two early, but anyway, we have been having sex every other day since I got off my period so we have got that base covered. But last night and all day today I have felt the same cramping you have... Someone told me that implantion can happen sooner than some, so maybe we are both getting pregnant right now!!! Let's keep our fingers crossed!!!! Good luck and lots and lots of baby dust!!!! xxxx|`|J42Q48cAaa	I have been having the same issue, my OV date was the 19th, BD on 18, 19, 20,21. I have been having some mild almost like twinges I would say.  We have been TTC for 6 months now, I have been concerned because my age (37). So hopefully this is a good sign for both of us. GOOD LUCK and tons of baby dust.|`|jYCMTrcZaa	Some months I just have light cramping when my egg is being released. I am guessing that is what is happening cause I pretty much know when I am ovulating and it always co-insides with that time.|`|eS68lGulaa	WAIT TILL U MISS A PERIOD ARE U TRYING TO DRIVE URESELF MAD??
GnJWVuqyaa	Absolutely stunning name!!!<br>  Has potential, independence,<br>  and personality.|`|qitXGd0qaa	I think the name Hadley is cute. A friend of a friend of mine named her daughter Hadley Grace.|`|ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	I don't like Hadley it sounds to masculine.|`|v6DRUwH7aa	Ehh not my taste at all but, to each their own.|`|AXEp1Bu6aa	I used to really like the name Hadley but now I think it's just average. It's not really that pretty, compared to name like Lilly, Holly, Haley & Kayla.<br>  Lynn is ok, very common though.|`|hkUzSsRZaa	Sorry but I don't like it! I like the lynn but not the Hadley. I likle Hailey Lynn better.|`|05b7c1c1fbc793d554bad3875ddb6118aa	adorable! hadley grace is pretty, also. i love it!|`|VEkkn2Otaa	Sounds kinda ugly!|`|7C0inbg6aa	I think Hadley is a very cute name...Hadley Lynn has a little bit too much "L" if you ask me.|`|4WyUrWaIaa	It's silly.|`|sa6J59elaa	I like it!  It's unique.  You could call her Haddie for short which is even cuter!|`|0hxK0khKaa	No.|`|Kx0XoZpmaa	Hadley is so pretty. It sounds great with Lynn. I love the name Hadley.<br>  (:|`|CkecSp4Uaa	What does "preshhh" mean?  Personally I'm not a fan, for some reason it makes me think of Hedley Lamarr, the bad guy from Blazing Saddles.  But if she really likes it then that's what's important.  After all, it's not a horrible name that no one could pronounce or spell and it doesn't have any obvious horrible nicknames.  And those are the things that I think are most important to consider when choosing names.
NMXTzJKsaa	The great thing about toddlers is that they are so easy to please!  I know we're giving ours board books, little balls and other little toys.  Also, I do a super easy egg hunt with them.  They love going around the living room, finding eggs that are in the most obvious of places.  They don't even need candy in them!|`|a7ahxGqaaa	As a child my mother always personalized Easter for me, so just put some of their favorite things in the basket. Like for my niece she likes fruit snacks, fruit, dress up stuff (she sooo into pretend now a days, its crazy how much personality that three year old has), and a keepsake. For most children under five, the Dollar Tree is God sent. Last, I do believe they should have something religious related in the basket because the real meaning is very important.<br>  <br>  Or you can do a activity with them that has both the religious and secular value to Easter, like Easter crafts where you make little Jesus  stick figures and Easter wood blocks that you can paint (yes its okay for toddlers to paint just make sure its outdoors or in a safe area). The Dollar Tree also provides these things and they are how much??? Of course a dollar.|`|cugUukc0aa	I usually but chocolate eggs but this year apart from that I am considering plush bunnies and chicks together with hand coloured easter eggs.|`|uuBeS7z5aa	the easter bunny does that, not you!|`|tle3AGJraa	A bottle of Dora Vitamins, some blocks, a few books.......|`|G2auAv1Saa	I don't give Easter baskets. <br>  We go to church and learn about the real meaning of Easter instead of buying into the consumerism of it.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	just a little candy.  We're still finishing up halloween candy.  And second the thoughts above about keeping Easter about religion, so we do talk about the tradition behind Easter baskets.<br>  <br>  Plus I dont like my kids to get a bunch of crap for every little event.  Then you end up with a cluttered house full of  cheap toxic plastic toys.|`|ZKLFRxduaa	Because my mother in law loads everyone up with chocolate I am going to find a book about easter, a little bunny and maybe one little egg for my 2 year old. She loves books and there are plenty around. I will probably also try and find some bunny ears for her. If I can talk my husband into it an "Easter Bunny" might appear in the backyard.|`|8DnIXwnyaa	a board book<br>  a football<br>  2 little cars<br>  a few eggs with 2-3 M&M's in each<br>  <br>  he's only 16 months old so he doesnt need much to be happy|`|AUsvrW8faa	Make sure you put a bible in there and teach the real reason for the easter celebration.|`|YBQvzEhGaa	I know one thing will be paper grass my cat eats the plastic kind.  Other than that we mostly put toys and bubbles my kids aren't big on candy.
eiJOdPgxaa	LOL @ your keyboard!<br>  <br>  Yea, baked beans are a brilliant source of food for babies - mash with potatoes, etc - they are full of goodness.|`|Wn0nwNFjaa	Heinz make No Added Salt beans, I used to give these to my daughter cos beans do have quite a bit of salt in them.|`|085DXX4Qaa	lol i thought you were referring to a "nine month old baked bean"<br>  which i would not recommend giving to anyone... haha.<br>  <br>  i don't think it's bad though<br>  pretty sure beans are good for teh kidz0rs. -nodnod-|`|3qLIRorjaa	Lol, your "s" key not working?<br>  <br>  yes, they're fine to give. As they're high in sugar and salt though it may be a good idea to get the healthier eating ones.|`|X6as2nOAaa	They would be fine, just watch to make sure that they don't choke on it. I have given my 7 month old beans and she likes them and does really good with them.|`|qjDxKXENaa	yes you can with mashed potatoes. not too much otherwise he may suffer from tummy pains.|`|SzDlCwfTaa	They will be fine with them.|`|2d98c2bb1f91687f4c39b7eaa00a89c9aa	i would be cautious of the fat and sugar content|`|sAbah6dTaa	i wouldn't see why not, now i wouldn't feed him the whole can but a helping wouldn't hurt, he'd probably love them anyways =)|`|7SKVCPcSaa	yeh, just watch so baby does choke. and watch for gassy stomach.|`|q4tTabfjaa	I think so, but don't quote me on that and I would definately mash them.  Oh and have you been eating biscuits over the key board?  giggle|`|E5CnUdhsaa	yep my daughter loves beans:) with scrambled egg and toast|`|8wnvhBQTaa	I give them to my twins and they love them, jus don't give a lot if your baby is bad with wind.|`|EqxxXrvLaa	Your 9 month old is definitely able to baked beans. I know that there is a big issue on feeding your little one honey (which can be an ingredient in baked beans), but you are your child's mother. You should know by know   the ingredients that you can introduce to your little one. If he can eat it serve it!|`|2vhXqnJzaa	Yes of course but I wouldn't give too many as they are notorious for causing wind so a few maybe.|`|Plu6OVoGaa	Yes you can because they're soft and easy to swallow. Plus, the baby's 9 months so he/she can eat things like that.|`|7528b8f85033fce97e21ab5ed3de8415aa	yes but don′t give to much or your baby will have runs later|`|l2xhRHk0aa	yeah|`|jxg88KqFaa	A small bowl would do a world of good. The more foods they are introduced to, the better. Too many could cause a stomach upset though.|`|VKTRAEbWaa	yeah - i am sure that ur baby would enjoy baked beans - just make sure you mash it up - u might be better draining them and giving the baby the sauce|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Definitely! I gave my baby baked beans for the first time when he was 8 months old. He loved them!
oWAUb6vpaa	Baby is usually head down by now but that doesn't mean that s/he won't move at any time between now and delivery. There have been cases where babies moved into position just before (or even sometimes - very few - during) labor. <br>  <br>  Your ob can try at time now to manually move the baby but that's a 50/50 as far as the doctor's choice, how s/he feels. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry as pregnancy and every baby is different. I would definitely ask your ob since this seems to be of great concern to you. Ask as soon as you have your next appointment, (since there's a chance this thought hasn't even entered the ob's miond yet..) <br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations!|`|hoX7hoINaa	Some babies wont turn until right when they are ready to come out and you are already in labor. Your baby has lots of time to turn around yet.|`|LFXTpqfdaa	If it doesn't happen by the time labor begins, then worry. For now, just keep those fingers crossed!|`|AA10071149	When I was about 35 weeks, my baby still hadn't turned, either. I never had to experience the doctor trying to manually adjust her, though, as she did eventually turn. To tell you the truth, I'm not sure my doctor would have tried to adjust her. They told me if she stayed like that we would have to think about a c-section.|`|AA11538461	Why don't you try to get her to turn?  You need to do the breech tilt.  What you do is lie on your back with your pelvis higher than your head.  Lie like this twice a day for 20 minutes at a time.  Seventy-five percent of the time the baby will turn himself.  I've heard there is a website called spinning babies.
qsjGSXaRaa	I'm amazed at the woman who wrote that she was told it would disappear in just weeks! Totally misinformed!<br>  <br>  Anyway, I think a lot of it has to do with skin tone. Mind you, the line is simply a long, dark line of melanin. Fair-skinned people have less melanin..darker-skinned people obviously have more. As for me, I have olive-toned skin so my line was pretty dark. My belly looked dirty!  Now, almost 4-months post-partum, it's faded but is still visible even though I've used professional exfoliating products. I scrub with a granular exfoliant in the shower and I do notice that it helps. The line is broken in certain places...not continual.<br>  <br>  Some people have written that their's NEVER went away (though they stated that it was faint). I hope that won't be the case for you and I!!! :o)|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	You could try cocoa butter to help it fade but I don't even remember how long mine took.  I just know it's gone.|`|kzt8Kdkfaa	I still had one at 6 weeks pp...I remember asking my ob/gyn about it at my 6 week visit.  I can't exactly rmember when it went away, but I do remember that using something to exfoliate seemed to help.|`|VKgD1K3baa	From what I have heard it will take longer to disappear if you are breastfeeding. I am almost 6 months pp, and although it has substantially faded, it is still there. Friends have told me that it should be gone by a year pp. Congrats on the new baby!|`|HqOkC2YHaa	Mine stuck around forever! My daughter is now 6.5 months old and I think it left last month, but it is still there just not dark<br>  <br>  Try scrubbing it really hard because it is just dead skin thats what I did with mine to get it to fade..|`|wphLaVs6aa	It took several months (4-5, perhaps?) for mine to finally disappear entirely.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I didn't get one so I really don't know how long it takes.|`|4dd9374df6045331049807f2de428a9aaa	I had mine for about 3 months after giving birth and I hated it. It's faded for the most part now, but if you look very carefully you can still see a faint line down my belly button. Don't worry, it will go away!|`|mvqfIjEVaa	Not sure how to speed it up - but my baby is almost 4 months old and I still have a faint line.|`|UkQuMykiaa	I don't know - I am almost 5 weeks pp and I still have mine.|`|bHAlwhTBaa	Mine went away around 6 months.  My husband called it my zipper.  Lovely, huh?|`|y3vozJ8Aaa	i was told 14 days... but it has been 21 days and it is still there. i hate it
PYtJ2GoFaa	There are not silly questions when it comes to pregnancy. This is a very uncertain time in a woman’s life! Sex will not cause you to miscarry, not at 8 weeks, or any other time during your pregnancy. (if you are not a high risk pregnancy). The only time sex is not safe when you are pregnant is if there are complications. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, it is not only safe, but can make pregnancy more enjoyable because it releases hormones that get rid of pregnancy aches and pains.|`|GZn5VNlSaa	No, just have him be gentle. If you've already talked to your doctor and she said your baby was healthy and normal and sex was fine then go for it.<br>  Sometimes women are asked to abstain because of a miscarriage history or something else.<br>  I abstained because of a prior miscarriage (blighted ovum) - but now I have had my baby's heartbeat confirmed, arms and legs and everything shown, i'm nearly 9 weeks. We mated last Saturday from the side and no bleeding or cramping or anything. <br>  <br>  Wait til you've seen your doctor and you've asked the questions to be ultra safe.<br>  But there shouldn't be any danger to your baby.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	No. It can't. Do yourself a favor and buy a pregnancy book and read it. Then you will be better prepared ot have a child. I reccomend Great Expectations: Your All In One Guide To Pregnancy and Childbirth|`|XGQpERs3aa	I doubt it.   The baby is too far up and it protected by your uterus.|`|h5cFkP35aa	sex is perfectly fine during pregnancy. chromosome abnormalities cause miscarriages or heavy drug abuse.|`|sIr2fWh6aa	not at all.  sex away! :)|`|ZXeUJ4RRaa	no|`|QSodlfMraa	i think not but just be care full or run it by your doctor.|`|nwHqblWiaa	no ;] has nothing to do with it!   best of luck to you sweetie.

I would think the knees, belly, under the arm, are fine. If they don't like it, STOP. It can be taken the wrong way, so be careful.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	Its cruel to torture this kid.<br>  You asked this question days ago. And minutes ago.|`|j3wown0oaa	Tickling is fun but it can also lead to anger. I would keep it down to a minimum.  And definitely let him get his tickles in on you.<br>  <br>  My brother use to hold me down and tickle me until I cried.  I hated it.  Luckily every once and a while my older sibling would hold him down for me and let me get my tickling revenge.  I always went for the ribs and the feet.|`|BRT2teSqaa	Until it becomes unenjoyable.  Laughing so hard and long can actually realy start to hurt the stomach and it's really hard to catch a breath.  You definitely do not want the kid gasping for air.<br>  <br>  Armpits and sides are the most ticklish.|`|xRUZkFU9aa	Why do you want to tickle him so bad? Are you a pedophile?
hVVALFAPaa	Why are you posting this multiple times in multiple sections?<br>  <br>  A tickle for a few seconds is about all. Enough to make him giggle. If he puts his arms up over his belly, STOP!|`|1hciyvKdaa	I have an uncle who tickled me as a kid, I hated him my entire life and when he died I cared less, thats how much I hate being tickled. Tickling is mean and you are very cruel.|`|YupMCYHlaa	Only while the kid is enjoying it.  They DO enjoy it sometimes, no matter how ticklish they are.  Kids need physical interaction, so its a good thing, so long as they are enjoying it. If he's excruciatingly ticklish, a little goes a long way.  Perhaps a little bit of tickling interspersed with a lot of wrestling.|`|hwHJ1vzCaa	I didn't know tickling is cruel. It makes you laugh, so how is cruel? Whatever. You can act like your playing a game with him and tell him to raise his arms all the way up. Then tickle him! Under the arms. :)|`|xRUZkFU9aa	LOL Well if he doesn't want to be tickled then you shouldn't touch him. LOL @ your question. You're funny.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	Never, not at all.<br>  Never.<br>  Its cruel.<br>  This question used to come up every day for a long time. Was that you?|`|sX2oWidkaa	It depends on him. If it hurts him or he wants you to stop, obviously stop. If not, carry on, I guess. His ticklish spots depend on him, too. Personally, my worst places are my sides. <br>  <br>  <br>  All of it is different for everyone. Just respect his boundaries.|`|GEsyKBeUaa	if your tickle-ing for fun, tickle until he pees...i dont really understand what the big words mean.
GWveqx61aa	its possible that your period could have been normal then out of wack again, i dont think you are preg, i think your level would have platformed and risen, but anything is possible, good luck and baby dust to all of us
7f065a5f8c99309ffaeba42afcaa6331aa	it would depend on HOW its written...ALL  child ( so called molesters 0 are not monsters as portrayed however some are.. the media portray them as beasts ( not saying they are not ) however.. people mess up.. do stuff that they will eventully regret... so a negative paper along with something positive ( people too, trying to be such ) should be included..dont just focus on the negative aspect|`|LgEdjhe0aa	I think you should use those examples. After all, these people are part of our society, and no matter how abhorrent we find their crimes, it's still a necessary evil to know about them.

Its adds realism to ur writing|`|xWfrA3vqaa	Yeah, it should be fine, it's not like you have to know them first hand, you can probably research too, so it's really no big deal. In order to write a good essay, you need to have good examples to go with it. Good luck.
xRUZkFU9aa	I think it's appropriate. I was writing essays like that in 6th grade. If the teacher gives them that..I dunno..I think they could have waited another year or two to give them that topic,...but if they want to use it as an example themselves..then sure, they are more than ready to.<br>  <br>  They are a teenager and know that there are bad people in the world and that's exactly what their parents have protected them from. I think it's awesome to be aware and develop an opinion at such an early stage. Also, when I was 11 and up I started reading about murderers and rapists...I was intrigued, but not in a sick way or anything. I learned a lot of "street smarts" simply by read..and I was really sheltered! LOL|`|IHm8A3qKaa	Erm, I'm in 6th grade. And I know these things.<br>  I wouldn't dare give away any hints that I do know these things, let alone put such examples and references to sex offenders in an essay.<br>  But, anyway.<br>  The person is 13. S/he is old enough to see PG-13 movies which, these days, have lots of references to sex, violence, drugs, foul language, etc. <br>  Of course, these would probably need to just be examples. The essay couldn't revolve around those, otherwise the teacher might be offended/shocked.|`|15qceXaOaa	why wouldnt it be? at 13 u start 2 know the way of the real world not the world u have oviously been raising ur kid in|`|eeGN977eaa	I think it is appropriate.

Yyqhbyoiaa	Not always true. With all my kids they were very active before and during labour.<br>  With #3 baby I was 34 weeks and having false labour for 4 days and he was very active and right before a contraction, the contractions were like 12,16,13,9 Min's apart for days and even when real labour kicked in he was still active moving around before a contraction.<br>  I was also dilated to 2cm. You just never really know what is going to happen and when. Good luck and congrats.|`|PYtJ2GoFaa	Could be. Most women say that their baby stopped moving as frequently before labor. This is usually because there is just not a whole lot of space left in there. <br>  <br>  The best thing to do is to look in the mirror and see if you have dropped (aka; lightening). If so you will fill pressure on your pelvic bone. Some other signs you might be getting ready for labor are that you notice that you are breathing easier (not as strained), you have more heartburn, and you are peeing more than normal. Good luck!
6ztG71Zvaa	You have to wait a month after your last period...<br>  Coming off the pill, your next period is not a true 1 but the ona after that will be... count 10 days after that period and this will be the perfect time to concieve... after all that's how i had my beautiful boy!<br>  waiting until your true period helps doctors to work out your gestation and when your baby will be born! it will also help to see if the baby is growing accordingly! it's all a little bit complicated but the 10 day rule works i proved it lol...<br>  Don't get stressed out about it as this will not help you concieve, make thing's as relaxed as possible for you and your husband. have fun and enjoy your bed room time, it may be the last time you get to enjoy yourselves for a long time.<br>  Good luck!<br>  hope this helps a little|`|8RfmosODaa	Yeah it will probably be different from going off bc. I went off it in september and had a period 2 weeks late then for 2 cycles it was 28 days then went to 45 days. I got pregnant but miscarried and now my periods are shorter, 25 days then 23 days. So I think bc affects your periods for awhile afterwords. Just have sex all the time and you should be preggo in no time! lol|`|NAzAmFDnaa	I got pregnant two months after stopping the pill after being on it for 10yrs.  My doctor's office told me not to expect anything and not to "try" until 3mon had passed so my body could adjust.  If I were you, just relax, don't fret about the dates too much but try to make love every other day.  In my opinion, stressing about the ovulation dates and such takes the fun out of it and stress doesn't help fertility.  Baby dust to you.
AA11373979	Ok-where to start?! The "Morning After Pill" if I'm correct, needs to be taken the morning right after you have had unprotected sex. In other words you probably should have taken it on Saturday and than used protection the other two days. Play it safe, talk to you OB/GYN and take a simple urine test to determine if you are pregnant.|`|XGQpERs3aa	The morning after pill can cause spotting.  Good luck!|`|dhto1A3caa	This could be a sign of an underlying illness. Your hair falling out, eating habits, taking the pill, having sex at an early age are all dangerous habits. See your doctor now. I would suggest doing some volunteer work, get a hobby and do things that will keep you busy day and night. Life is too short to be having such worries. Enjoy life, stay away from boys.  Whether pregnant or not, quit sex. You need to make an appointment with a doctor to rule out any illnesses|`|FfxgHWGxaa	i became pregnant when i took the morning after pill. go and get checked out

XmJZkFuMaa	With the rising number of kids diagnosed with autism, I understand your point of view.  I also realize that we over-vaccinate our kids, the number of vaccinations meant to be done before the child enters daycare or preschool is ridiculous.  Sorry to all the parents who buy into it, but it really is.  If you don't have plans on sending your child to preschool, daycare, or anything until Kindergarten then you can spread the vaccinations out far more.  <br>  <br>  I recommend getting "The Vaccine Book" and reading it through.  The fact is, most doctors won't work with you, or they'll tell you just how uneducated and stupid you're being, how the dangers of the disease are so much worse than the vaccine, etc, etc.  The facts are that there are some vaccinations that our kids don't need (like the Hep B at birth when neither you or your hubby have any of the risk factors, the chances of a negative reaction are higher than the chances of her having Hep B.)  You have to weigh everything.<br>  <br>  And then you have to consider other things too.  Like... there's a city about 70 minutes from where I live where people don't vaccinate any of their kids, and about every 2-3 years their kids get Whooping Cough.  This is extremely dangerous.  If I lived in some places in the country, the chances of my daughter ever coming in contact with Whooping Cough is very minute, and I would put it off a few years.  But HERE, she would most likely come in contact with it in her first year, therefore it's not worth the chance and she got that shot.  <br>  <br>  Parents need to be intelligent about this, study it out and not just take the doctor's word for it.  Maybe my opinion is based on the fact that our doctor typically tries to bully me, and also our doctor doesn't keep accurate records about my daughter so I have to be far more involved than some parents.  I don't know.  But I can't imagine just letting them pump her full of everything they want to pump her full of by 2 years old.<br>  <br>  Add:  Just for the record, I am for getting vaccinations, but at a more spaced out schedule than getting them all done by 18 months.  To me that's plain ridiculous, especially if you don't plan on your child to be in daycare from 18 months on.<br>  <br>  Also, just for the record, the study that people are quoting is because of a connection between the measles shot in adults causing diarrhea, and this possibly having a connection to autism.  The study found that the kids who had autism didn't have measles in their intestines, so the chances of that being a cause are minute.  However, it doesn't discount the earlier connection between children who biologically may be more prone to autism being tipped over the edge.  <br>  <br>  In the end, to me it matters more about how many chemicals we're pumping in our kids when so many of them aren't necessary.  There are some vaccinations where the chance of adverse reactions are greater than the chance of the child having an issue if they got the actual disease.  Parents simply should educate themselves.|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	This is one of those questions I don't think can accurately be answered.  Those who are pro-vaccinations will say it's safe.  Those who are con-vaccinations will say they aren't.  And both sides will come up with various reasons to support their argument.  What you have to do is research the specific vaccinations you're concerned about.  Find out the ingredients and research the side effects.  Also, research the diseases they're meant to immunize the child from.  Then decide if you could live with the outcome in either situation.  If you don't vaccinate and your child gets a disease, could you handle that?  Or if you do vaccinate and your child suffers the side effects or still gets the disease, would you be alright with that?  It's a hard decision for some of us and you just have to make the decision that you feel is best for your family.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Each person has to weight the benefit versus the risk.  Some vaccines there just isn't a risk, several are considered eradicated including diptheria, polio, and tetanus 1 kid in the US gets it in a year and you have a 24 hour window to get it before lockjaw sets in so no the risk outweighs the benefits and aren't worth it.  Like you said, neither is hep B because its an std.  <br>  <br>  The MMR is one of the most controversial, its live and a combo shot, its not available seperately in the US anymore.  It is given at 12-18 months and the booster at 4-6 years.  95 percent of kids get immunity from the first one, so drawing titers should be routine before giving the second.<br>  <br>  Measles there actually is a risk to getting it so the measles portion of the vaccine nolonger available seperately in the US actually the benefit outweighing the risk could be argued.<br>  Rotavirus doesn't work, nearly all 3 year olds have had it despite 97 percent being vaccinated for it, and its only diahrrea so I'd skip that.<br>  <br>  Chicken pox is definately better to skip, nobody gets boosters, nobody knows when it wears off leaving the adult at risk for it or shingles and the disease is worse for adults.<br>  <br>  Flu shot-skip it, a new batch is made yearly, and adequate studies aren't done on it since each year is different strains that are educated guesses at best.  oh the flu shot contains egg, thimerisol and formaldyhyde.<br>  <br>  <br>  Prevnar (pneumococcal) isn't mandated and I am always wary about that.<br>  <br>  Many are concerned about autism but what about bipolar, ADHD and IDDM (diabetes)?   Correlations have been made but since everybody with a big enough pocket book has a conflict of interest, the studies are biased and none are large enough to be considered because they aren't 5000 participant, double blind, peer reviewed, and published in reputable medical journal.<br>  <br>  it is a fallicy to say that herd immunity is decreased from the unvaccinated population and that certain diseases are on the rise.  The cdc doesn't recognize certain diseases on the rise and the herd immunity is only compromised if less than 85 percent of the population is vaccinated, current compliance rates are 97-98 percent|`|oojO4WAraa	Yes.  It has been studied and studied.  There is no link to autism.  Some parents blame the vaccines - but they have to blame something. Science does not support their claims.  And vaccinations are a lot safer than a child getting polio, or the other diseases they are vaccinated against.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	There is no link to autism.  That apparent "link" was down to one study of a very small number of children.  The doctor involved was letter proven unreputable.<br>  <br>  I'd definitely rather vaccinate than have my son contract a disease.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	if they weren't safe, they wouldn't offer them.|`|LwJ7EiZ4aa	Here is my view on it....<br>  <br>  My daughter is 8 months old and she will be getting ALL of her shots. I know autism is a concern for a lot of parents but there is NO evidence that autism is linked with vaccines. I have listened to both  sides and I really believe that there is more to autism than vaccines (ex. hereditary). If you are concerned please talk with your doctor before you make your decision because he/she can answer a lot of your questions. Also, you can talk about a different vaccination schedule where they spread out the vaccines more. Please make a decision based on research and knowledge not fear. Vaccines are crucial for the health of EVERYONES children and are about preventing horrible, sometimes life threatening diseases. My opinion is that vaccines are crucial and to talk to your doctor, do your own research and listen to your options before making a decision because you could be endangering your childs life.|`|g4mvfBQ8aa	The was a recent study out to see the link between autism and vaccines and the conclusion was that there was no link.  I understand those who saw a difference in there child once they say their child had a vaccine.  The fact is that vaccines save lives.  People don't die from things they used to because of them.  There is risk involved with everything but that is the very small minority.  It just like when you sign consent to receive blood, to circumcise your son, to agree to take any medication whether it be antibiotics, etc.  You or I could have a reaction and die.  There is no 100% proof to anything because people react differently to things.  It is a possibility, but that is not the norm.   I am weary of new vaccines just because I like for them to be out awhile and time to prove the effectiveness.  As for the ones that have been out for years, I would definitely give to my kids.  If a child is to have autism it was just meant to be in my eyes.  I think that part of the explanation for autism is just like anything else...there are more people and with more people, the more prevalence of disease and illness.  Hope this helps.  I give Hep B to babies everyday and never had one bad reaction.|`|USoqyjaAaa	These vaccines are recommended to protect your baby from life-threatening diseases.  The problem is that when too many people avoid vaccines, these diseases can take hold in the population.  I can't go into each and every disease but I would suggest you look up information from the National Immunization Program.  There is information on each disease.  You might want to ask someone over 60 or so what they think of all these diseases.   They will have experienced them first hand as the vaccines were not available when they were growing up.  Please educate yourself on hepatitis B as well.  It is not just a sexually transmitted disease but is bloodborne too.  So if your kid is playing with another kid and someone gets cut there is the potential for a blood exposure.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	My thought on it is Would I rather have my child die of polio or have autism. Autism I can live with, serious diseases that can kill my child I can't! Not tom ention there's no proof that vaccinations lead to autism. The thought is that they can "bring out" autism in a child that has it ( that's what the parents of my autistic clients have said) plus your putting everyone elses chils at risk by not getting them done!|`|j5BCyi0laa	everything  people said b4 my response is completely right.  it's very irresponsible for parents to believe the hype about the link of vaccinations and autism.  my middle child has autism, my oldest does not have it.  my almost 10 month old is going to receive all of her shots, i'm not going to waive any of them.  she is up to date on the shots she was suppose to get from birth to now, and so far she is developing mentally and emotionally just fine.|`|d6ASNpNsaa	I know there is a lot of controversy about vaccines.  I have a 4 year old and a 2 year old.  They both have had all the vaccinations and have had no problem.  I think the diseases they are protected from potentially crippling and fatal are worth it.  I don't think a child can go to school if they are not vaccinated.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	as far as i have researched all injections are safe. th elinks with autism is only there as syptoms commonly arise or are more noticeable after a year old the same time as mmr is given but there has been no evidence to prove this.....you can if you want ask to get the mmr done seperately|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	yes they are safe if they weren't safe we would not give them to our children.  All three of my kids, got all of their vaccinations. I did feel scared when they were really little but better safe than sorry.
XmJZkFuMaa	Since I have been loved by a person with Down Syndrome, recognize that they love and enjoy life, I would realize that I don't have the right to kill them just because they don't perceive the world like I do.  I would keep the child, I'd do my best by he/she, and I would get what help I needed to make it work.  I would watch as my daughter now would learn to love and accept people for who they are, and not think they should be killed just because they don't have the same strengths as other people.  I know our family would love him/her and that she/he would truly add to our richness.|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	Not fair to let a child live like that!  I find your statement highly offensive I have a sister with downs and she is one of the happiest people I know!  Just because you have downs doesn't make you incapable of living it just makes it more of a challenge she may never live on her own but she goes to school and can make her own food drinks and everything I think and this is just my opinion and I know some wont agree but that is an ignorant statement... I am sure you know where I stand with that...<br>  <br>  <br>  my sister was never a burdan to me or my brother she is our sister and she loves my son and they get along so well she is the best aunt and my parents have never one time regretted keeping her and loving her and treating her as normal as possible...<br>  <br>  <br>  People downs kids do NOT have to have their parents feed them or help them go to the toilet!  If you think that you have never been around enough of them...|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	Honestly, I have no clue. I don't even want to think of that situation until it happens.|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	That's a really tough question. I'm sure that I would keep it. What is the tests all came back normal and the baby had down's anyways? I could never give it up then. I definitely wouldn't have an abortion, but I might consider adoption. I really don't know. My fiance has this special gift for interacting with people with disabilities unlike anyone I've ever seen, so for I don't think he would let me get an abortion solely for that reason.<br>  I don't agree with your comment about it not being far to them to live like that. I don't even know what that is supposed to mean. Have you ever known anyone with down's syndrome? My cousin, who is passed away now has it, and also the little boy who lives across the street from us. They are real people with real hearts and feelings and personalities and quite frankly I don't even think they know the difference. That is like saying someone who is born without legs shouldn't have a chance to live just because his life would different than yours and a little more difficult. I can see why you would be worried about the rest of your family and their needs and feelings, but not the child itself.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	I can't say definitively, but I strongly believe I wouldn't/couldn't abort if I somehow found out my baby had downs.  I'd keep the baby and raise him/her.  I know a few people with downs and they have led a fulfilling, happy life.<br>  <br>  I didn't get any of the tests done, because I wouldn't have aborted anyway.|`|wphLaVs6aa	I'd have the child and love him or her with all my heart. A child with Down Syndrome isn't any less valid than another child. They have the capacity to love, to be happy, to feel sadness, to learn things, to have hopes and dreams.|`|2d98c2bb1f91687f4c39b7eaa00a89c9aa	when I hear parents talk about their down syndrome child, they always think of them as a gift---hmmm, seems to me it would be a burden ON YOU!! (being selfish with your time)|`|u94HOVz7aa	my personal beliefs is that abortion is wrong no matter what the circumstances are.  I would never abort so i opt out of the genetic testing when i am pregnant because it wouldnt matter to me.  I would just worry for the rest of my pregnancy, but i would keep it.  as for adoption i dont think i could. i love all my babies and would think about them all the time wondering if i had made the right decision, feeling guilty for keeping the babies i have now, but not that baby.  I would feel like i was telling that baby i didnt love it enough to keep it.  Babies are a gift from god and he only gives us what he thinks we can handle. so, if he thinks i can handle a handicaped child then i will do my best to raise it with all the love and care i can.|`|4YIUxSlYaa	Would you abort if you found out in time?  No<br>  Would you put it up for adoption?  No<br>  Would you keep it and raise it?  Yes<br>  What would you do?  Treat it like a normal child, a child with downs isn't exactly that much harder, they just learn a little slower.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't be fair to kill a perfectly healthy child.  So it might learn a little slower, but I really fail to see why the child would be such a burden on your life.|`|dwdLkvgPaa	he or she is still our baby so I would give birth and live as best as we can...some people with Downs still go on to lead a pretty productive life...if you have ever see the look on a kids face with downs when he or she succeeds you would definalty agree that it is worthwhile to give them a chance at life....as for you other children they would need to adjust simple as that....I have had 2 babies and have not been tested either time...that kind of thing isnt that important to us i guess...we just love our babies no matter what...|`|6lyvhRLsaa	I'd keep them, its hardly the babies fault. They have perfectly happy lives, if you make them happy for them. <br>  <br>  Before I got pregnant I would have said I'd abort, but now the miracle of bringing a child into the world no matter what was wrong with him is something I would want to do.|`|xPfJG3FGaa	god forgive me but i would probably abort, for many reasons, i wouldn't be able to care for it forever, and i wouldn't wanna see it live like that, oh but then i should at least give it a chance, i don't know, i would be devestated and torn!|`|yCwPxulYaa	If my baby had down syndrome, I would keep her and love her just the same.  Developmental delays has no part in determining my love for my child.|`|UdtzY5ciaa	We wouldn't have.  We didn't do any of those tests.   My wife works special ed, and we both understand the stress and difficulties that could have happened, but we were both willing to accept that responsibility.|`|AA11348933	I declined to be tested for it because those prenatal tests have a high rate of false positives.  It wasn't worth the stress.|`|D5cOFZdwaa	I would keep it. i dont believe in murder or giving away your kids. it would teach us all understanding and paitence.|`|CyNFIa99aa	I cant believe how ignorant people are. Saying people with  Down syndrome cant live self sufficient lives, or have a good life is the mind set of about 50 years ago! People these days with DS can go to school college, get jobs and some do live independantly or in homes with assistance. There are people with DS who are artists, athletes (one girl swam across one of the great lakes), musicians, college graduates, special ed teachers etc. I refused the amnio for my son who is now 21 months because I would not have aborted him any ways. He ended up being born with DS (mosaic) and I wouldnt change him for the world. He is very bright, loved, loving, and funny he tries to make everyone laugh. I can see him definanlty being the class clown. People who say they would abort dont know anything about DS and especially dont KNOW anyone with DS. These days babies with DS get early intervention to help them with physical and mental delays to the point where they arent far behind other children their age and in some cases get ahead, and they are just now beginning to learn the potential of people with DS. What do you know, if we just teach them and give them a chance, they will learn, just maybe at a slower pace with SOME things.I have my hopes set high for my son, and I will never say he cant do something becuase of his genetic condition. As a society we are so infatuated with this idea of "perfection" that we want to discard anything that isnt considered perfect. Pretty soon we will be aborting blind peopple deaf people, ADD, autistic, red heads, because they shouldnt "live like that" There are literally WAITING LISTS of parents who want to adopt babies with DS, so if you dont think you couldnt handle a little extra time and patience of raising a child with DS, then adopt. 90% abort, and those people are quite possibly missing out on the most special wonderful person of their lives. My son is so beautiful and special and everyone who meets him falls in love with him. <br>  To get a REAL view on people with DS, go to WWW.YOUTUBE.COM and type in the search, "mini documentary about people with Down syndrome" and take 7 minutes out of your time to open your pretty little eyes to what people with DS are like. Its about 4 people with DS, one a special ed teacher, one a college student, one a worker at wall mart, and one who is about to get married.<br>  Also check out WWW.SUJEETDUSAI.COM to check out this musical genious and college grad who happens to have DS, he is also married and was an honor role student in HS.<br>  As humans we can sometimes be so ignorant that people like a lot of you here think that my son and people like him dont deserve to live just becuase he learns DIFFERENT then you and me. Some people with DS may not be really smart in rocket science but I can guarentee many of them are smarter than you all when it comes to discrimintation and unconditional love and smart in how to treat others, and smart in a way that they know how wonderful life really is.<br>  <a href="http://www.kcdsg.org/for_me.php?show_child=79" rel="nofollow">http://www.kcdsg.org/for_me.php?show_chi...</a>  this site shows some very talented people with DS.   Just scroll down the page and click on the highlighted names, people need to look at these sights to get a reality check.|`|ikpKEqIlaa	I work in group homes and schools with many adults and kids who have Down's Syndrome.  They are some of the most loving, sweet, funny, and sarcastic people I've ever met.  They can read and write, play sports and  musical instruments, cook; many of them can live independently with some support.  They are great friends who love people unconditionally.  Maybe you should spend some time with someone with a disability before you go deciding who has a right to live.|`|TebFtbHAaa	.<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  <br>  1. Your question is so disrespectful to life, and people with down-syndrome and parents of children with down-syndrome.<br>  2. Your idea that if a child has down syndrome, they will be better off being killed than have life.<br>  3. What will be next? Will you kill a child because they will be obese in the future, or because they will have brown eyes rather than blue eyes?<br>  4. You would rather take a "shortcut" in life to abort the child rather than take the time to care for he/she and love he/she.<br>  5. You cannot accept or trust the fact that God has a plan for that child, more than the choice to kill it.<br>  6. If the down-syndrome child was born and was maybe three weeks years old. Would you decide to kill him/her then because he/she has down-syndrome.

If it has the ability to live outside the womb, then it should have the right. Now if a baby had an open spine or something that would make it unable to thrive outside the womb, then I probabaly would, but only if it had no chance what so ever.|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	I was always so scared when I would take those tests that it would come back positive, but I love my babies so much. I would deal with whatever would come my way, when you make the decision to become a mother, you should take whatever GOD decides to give you. Just because the baby would be born with this handicap doesn't make him/her any less of a person. Thank God my babies were born healthy, but if the situation were any different they are still my kids and I would love them no matter what. Everyone has their own opinions though and I don't judge, just stating my opinion.|`|JNvUskw1aa	NO DON"T ABORT IT! IT IS MURDER. I saw on youtube.com what happens during abortion and it was awful. I would keep it and raise it and wouldn't treat it no different than any other child. KEEP IT! Abortion is murder no matter what. God don't like it when people murder each other so killing a baby inside your belly is the same thing.<br>  Go to youtube.com and type in abortion and tell yourself would you like to see that happen to you or the child you are aborting.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	I ABSOLUTLEY would not. In respnce to not letting achild "live like that" I have ALOT of down syndrome clients that go on to have jobs and their own apartments and they are some of the happiest people I know. I wouldn't give my baby up if I found out they would be missing a limb or have ADHD (id it were possible to know that) I say things like that could be a blessing in disguise and hell they are still people down syndrome not!|`|rhypzNW8aa	Definately not! Every child is a gift no matter what challenges they bring.When my eldest was at school there was a boy with downsyndrome in his class and he was quite intelligent and to say 'i don't think it's fair to let a child live like that' implies a subhuman quality of life,they live like the rest of us only with abit more care and attention.What other reasons for aborting a baby do you have,club feet,hare lip?YOU HAVE A BABY AND TREASURE IT.|`|CIZjK2rAaa	No I would not have an abortion.<br>  No I would not put it up for adoption.<br>  Yes I would keep it and raise it to the best of my ability.<br>  <br>  I know it would be hard on me, my husband and other children but I think it would be unfair not to keep it.  A baby is a gift from God and I couldn't throw that gift away.|`|UkQuMykiaa	Absolutely not.  I would not allow the AFP test during my last pregnancy because I did not want to know because it did not matter.  I am against abortion and could not imagine destroying a life that God gave to me.  If the baby had Down's than that is the decision of God and is not for me to decide if the child lives or dies.|`|8gnp5Kkjaa	If my wife and I found that she was pregnant with a baby that would have Down Syndrome, we would love him or her just the same.  Sure there would be all the related challenges, but is that a reason to deny the child a chance to exist?  I personally do not believe so.|`|w7fCw6WTaa	This probably won't be a popular answer here but I would have an abortion. The vast majority of downs kids can't do much for themself and end up being dependent on parents or carers even for simple things like feeding or going to the toilet. Doesn't seem life a very high quality of life to me.|`|Plu6OVoGaa	I don't know what I would do. Killing an innocent life is wrong, especially if it's your child. And my aunt had a disabled child and kept it. Her life was hard but I think it's more courageous to keep it then to just discard what you don't want. Plus, she always said, God only gives you what you can handle.|`|wUfZJvbUaa	i honestly can't believe your question!!! i'm sorry but WHO are WE to say whose life is worth living, whose life isn't?? have you known anyone with down syndrome? i bet not! i don't really consider it a handicap... people with down syndrome can be very smart... they learn many many things... at a different rate but that does NOT mean they are a burden! so to answer your question, YES, I'd definitely keep my baby and raise her/him just like any other baby. i would make sure to help him thrive to the maximum of his potential. just like any other baby!|`|mvqfIjEVaa	No, I wouldn't abort.  I'd keep the child and love it and be thankful.  People with Down's Syndrome lead wonderfully happy and fulfilled lives.  Who am I to say that that life is not worth living?|`|YAoFWkcDaa	In my Biomedical Ethics class this year, my professor provided us with the statistic: About 90% of women abort in your hypothetical situation.<br>  <br>  I'm almost positive that I would too, and I needn't say more.|`|fcd636025e76c058a2168ad39e2b6f7daa	I would keep it and raise it and love it just the same.|`|3gx5eXf5aa	i would keep it. I'm not trying to be mean or anything but people who even think about abortion are baby murders and that is wrong and i think it is very selfish of you to say you would kill you own kid if you get pregnant it is your responsibility to take care and comfort that child and if you don't want to do that then someone else will everyone deserves a chance at life EVERYONE it is not fair to that baby not to have a chance it can have just a good of a life as you but if you kill it how would you ever know that and as far as it being fair  how dare you say that it sounds like to me you are a very selfish woman who only thinks of herself and what makes you happy and that is not right|`|OPloDbxvaa	my sister just had a baby with downs she's 23 the baby is now 7 months ol and in the hospital after his open heart surgery and he's doing great , she did all the test possible and nothing came up until the day he was born ... and even though it's been a rough couple months... she would have never aborted that child he is a blessing and has important has any child , and deserved a chance to live and his 3 year old brother loves him to death...|`|F4FJVq37aa	I would keep it and raise it. I believe God does everything for a reason, and if that's what he gave me, I would take it, and thank him everyday for giving me my child. Its not my place to decide if a child should live or die.|`|7K6vpsdhaa	No I wouldn't have an abortion or put the baby up for adoption. I believe every child has a chance at life and I would do my damnedest to make sure that the child had as perfect a life as I could give it.

O estudo foi liderado pela doutora Kitty Bloemenkamp e publicado no nmero de 10 de janeiro da revista Archives of Internal Medicine.    No total,109 mulheres estavam usando plulas anticoncepcionais quando foram vtimas da trombose venosa, localizada nas veias das pernas. Os principais sintomas foram a dor, edemas, e inflama??es. As pacientes foram tratadas com repouso e medicamentos para diminuir a coagula??o do sangue.    Analisando os resultados, os autores verificaram que o risco da ocorrncia de trombose venosa nos primeiros seis meses de uso da plula anticoncepcional  dezenove vezes mais alto em mulheres com altera??es da coagula??o do sangue.

Gente isso eh o que se chama LUBRIFICACAO e se nao houve ejaculacao antes, a lubrificacao nao tem espermatozoides nenhuns.    Para responder a pergunta, ou voce estah brincando, ou entao aconteceu o que em tempos idos, era a (unica) defesa das prostitutas. Eh o seguinte. O que acontece eh que o organismo feminino tem a capacidade de usar o sistema imune para, neste caso, neutralisar o esperma de seu companheiro. Isto nao significa necessariamente, que um ou os dois sejam estereis. Se amanha voce tiver relacoes sexuais com outro homem, podera ficar gravida de imediato.  Este mecanismo de defesa, acontecia com as prostitutas e pode ser ativado havendo um e o mesmo companheiro, ou uma centena de parceiros sexuais.  Se e/ou quando quiser engravidar, seu Medico possivelmente lhe dira para nao ter relacoes sexuais com seu parceiro, durante um determinado periodo de tempo, 1 mes, 2, ate 3 meses; todos os casos sao diferentes.   Isto nao impede que voces facam testes para determinar se ha outros problemas.|`|37ad80b0d7c2ce35af79c716d953b352aa	Sortuda vc!!!!!I Vc pode ser esteril ou ele ja pensou nisso????isso n?o funciona com todo mundo.

Yo desde luego que no lo hara con ese producto que citas, alcanfor. Te lo comento como qumico, pues no soy mdico.    Te copio sobre el producto:    Toxicidad    La exposicin a grandes cantidades de naftalina puede da?ar o destruir una porcin de sus glbulos rojos. Esto puede hacer que el nmero de glbulos rojos disminuya significativamente hasta que su cuerpo reemplace las clulas destruidas. Esta condicin se llama anemia hemoltica. Algunos de los sntomas de la anemia hemoltica son fatiga, falta de apetito, agitacin y palidez. La exposicin a grandes cantidades de naftalina tambin puede causar nusea, vmitos, diarrea, sangre en la orina y una coloracin amarilla de la piel. No hay estudios de seres humanos expuestos a la 1-metilnaftalina o 2-metilnaftalina.    Los animales a veces exhiben opacidad de los ojos despus de tragar grandes cantidades de naftalina. No se sabe si esto sucede tambin en seres humanos. Respirar vapores de naftalina diariamente de por vida produjo irritacin e inflamacin de la nariz y los pulmones en ratas y ratones. Aun no est claro si la naftalina afecta el sistema reproductivo en animales; la mayora de la evidencia es negativa.    La administracin de 1-metilnaftalina y 2-metilnaftalina mezcladas en la comida a ratones durante la mayor parte de sus vidas produjo la acumulacin de un material anormal en los pulmones.|`|7ebe41d5d110e1e07f2f1e77d50a5463aa	Si los puedes da?ar, su piel es muy sencible y le puedes causar irritacin, si quieres, genera vapores de vick o de alcanfor y que los inhale en el cuarto pero no muy cerca ya que lo puedes quemar|`|e95ec39b44b22818913cbd08698df5f2aa	En las cointridicacciones sale que no es recomendable. pero yo le pase a mi bebe y no le hizo nada.. fijate ante la duda preguntale al pediatra|`|cbe43bc4b3badb18e6fa253554472cbeaa	No lo hagas, ademas en las indicaciones dice no usar en ni?os menores a 1 a?o|`|930fe73b33732f29f1d90a326d6ddf17aa	No. Mira estos casos de intoxicacin por alcanfor (uno de ellos de una beb a la que se le suministr Vick Vaporub):    http://sisbib.unmsm.edu.pe/bvrevistas/Pa...|`|78e3e8e2f8ab768a74e72c91622ed25caa	no ni se te ocurra ve al medico es sumamente toxico para ni?os asi que si esta congestionado vapor de agua y nada mas y ya tienes que estar saliendo para tu doc.    saludos|`|433a0975866eef2aa88496bcfdf00407aa	Qu bonito nombre tienes.

Eh muito simples. Primeiro dia de sua menstruacao conta como dia 1. Dai conta todos os dias e seus dias ferteis sao entre o DECIMO e o DECIMO SETIMO dias, ovulacao ocorre SEMPRE no DECIMO QUARTO dia.    O ciclo menstrual varia em tamanho, somente porque corpos diferentes reagem de forma diferente a expelir o ovulo que nao foi fertilisado. Isso nao tem qualquer influencia sobre o dia de ovulacao.    Tambem nao fica acreditando em crendice nao. Come isso, faz aquilo, que eh isso????!!!  Sempre visite seu medico, quando sentir que algo nao vai bem.

Isso ocorre cerca de 14 dias antes da menstrua??o. Se o espermatozide encontrar o vulo e fertiliz-lo, a gravidez acontece.    Neste caso, imediatamente ocorrem intensas modifica??es em todo o organismo, que podem ser sentidas como sensa??es de incha?o, nuseas, v?mitos. Dentro do tero ocorrem tambm altera??es que s?o importantes para que o ovo recm-fecundado possa ali se fixar e se desenvolver. Por essa raz?o, durante a gravidez a menstrua??o desaparece. Caso n?o ocorra gravidez, nada disso acontece. Dentro do tero s?o frustradas as mudan?as e o vulo  eliminado - a mulher menstrua.    Aps o trmino da menstrua??o todo o ciclo recome?a. Inicia-se nova fase na qual, no interior do ovrio come?a a amadurecer outro vulo, que estar pronto para "ser ovulado" aps duas semanas.    Tem-se ent?o, no ciclo menstrual, duas fases:    1a. A primeira  aquela que vai da menstrua??o at a ovula??o. A dura??o desta fase  varivel, pois depende de quanto tempo o vulo leva para amadurecer - aproximadamente 14 dias (s vezes mais, s vezes menos).    2a. A segunda fase vai da ovula??o at a menstrua??o seguinte e n?o varia: quase sempre dura 14 dias .    Conclui-se que o ciclo menstrual normal pode variar, ms a ms (25 a 35 dias, aproximadamente), dependendo da dura??o da primeira fase do ciclo.    Outra informa??o importante  a de que o perodo frtil se estende dois dias antes e dois dias depois da ovula??o, porque o espermatozide pode durar no organismo feminino por cerca de 48 horas aps a rela??o sexual.    Agora, resta a pergunta: levando-se em conta a varia??o da primeira fase do ciclo, como determinar exatamente o momento da ovula??o? A maneira  calcular a dura??o de todos os ciclos (entre o incio de uma menstrua??o e o incio da seguinte), ms a ms, durante um ano -  a famosa "tabelinha".    Consideram-se os intervalos do ciclo mais longo e do mais curto. Por exemplo, suponhamos que, em um ano, o ciclo mais curto tenha sido de 26 dias e o mais longo de 32 dias.    1o. Para determinar o incio do perodo frtil, utiliza-se o ciclo mais curto e se descontam 14 dias (segunda fase) e, como garantia, mais 2 dias:    26 dias - 14 dias - 2 dias = 10o dia = incio do perodo frtil .    2o. Para determinar o fim do perodo frtil, utiliza-se o ciclo mais longo, descontam-se 14 dias e se aumentam mais 2 dias: 32 dias - 14 dias + 2 dias = 20o dia = fim do perodo frtil .    Assim, os dias em que h menor chance de ocorrer gravidez s?o: do 1o dia da menstrua??o at o 10o dia e do 20o dia do ciclo at o incio da menstrua??o seguinte.    Por seguran?a, prolonga-se o perodo frtil em dois dias (no exemplo, do 9o ao 21o dia), pois o vulo permanece "fertilizvel" por 6 a 12 horas.    A eficcia deste mtodo varia de 60 a 80%; para compara??o, a da plula  de 98 a 99%.    Portanto no seu caso o seu perodo frtil ser, do dia 08 ao dia 12 de Outubro.    Eu tambm tentei engravidar durante 4 meses aquando do meu segundo filho. At que desisti... duas semanas depois estava grvida!

AA11335848	The problem isn't that you are getting your period, or that "having a period means its getting rid of what its not using for pregnancy".  The problem is that while the average time of ovulation is 14 days after the first day of the period, this time frame is not accurate for most women.  It's only the "average" number.  Most women ovulate around this time - a few days before or a few days after.  Some also ovulate during their period, some ovulate more than once a month.  Unless you and your doctor have tracked your fertile times (your ovulation cycle), you never really know exactly when you could be ovulating.  It's not terribly uncommon for women to become pregnant while getting their period.      You also have to remember that the period you get while using birth control is not natural - meaning it's not being timed by your own ovulation, it's being timed by the pill.  So you could be ovulating any time that week of your period.  Skipping pills allows your body time to potentially resume all it's reproductive processes - menstruation and ovulation.  You can get pregnant.|`|a1fb17d8d466c12eeed48a99ab4957c5aa	Spotting is not the same as having a period.  Spotting can be caused by many different things.  The pill, just like any form of birth control is not 100% garenteed even when taken correctly...which means at the same exact time every day.  If you miss the pill there is a small chance that you will ovulate which will make it possible for you to get pregnant.  You should always use two forms of birth control, not only to keep yourself from getting pregnant but also to protect yourself from STD's and STI's.

Todos que ela via dizia a mesma coisa, " quero um puntador da Barbie" e todos corriam e compravam um apontador pra ela, sendo que todos imaginavam a mesma coisa, pois ela estava na escolinha, achvamos que ela tinha visto de alguma amiguinha.   Um belo dia passando em frente de uma loja de brinquedos no shopping, ela saiu correndo e gritando "olha o puntador da Barbie" , quando cheguei perto pra ver , cai na gargalhada na realidade o "puntador" da Barbie era mesmo o "COMPUTADOR DA BARBIE".

Uma manh?, a professora disse:   - Hoje ns iremos fazer um desenho.   "Que bom!!" - pensou o menininho.   Ele gostava de desenhar le?es, tigres, galinhas, vacas, trens e barcos...   Pegou a sua caixa de lpis-de-cor e come?ou a desenhar.   A professora ent?o disse:   - Esperem, ainda n?o  hora de come?ar !   Ela esperou at que todos estivessem prontos.   - Agora, disse a professora, ns iremos desenhar flores.   E o menininho come?ou a desenhar bonitas flores com seus lpis rosa, laranja e azul.   A professora disse:   - Esperem ! Vou mostrar como fazer.   E a flor era vermelha com caule verde.   - Assim, disse a professora, agora vocs podem come?ar.   O menininho olhou para a flor da professora, ent?o olhou para a sua flor.   Gostou mais da sua flor, mas n?o podia dizer isso...   Virou o papel e desenhou uma flor igual a da professora.   Era vermelha com caule verde.   Num outro dia, quando o menininho estava em aula ao ar livre, a professora disse:   - Hoje ns iremos fazer alguma coisa com o barro.   - "Que bom !"!!!. Pensou o menininho.   Ele gostava de trabalhar com barro.   Podia fazer com ele todos os tipos de coisas: elefantes, camundongos, carros e caminh?es.   Come?ou a juntar e amassar a sua bola de barro.   Ent?o, a professora disse:   - Esperem ! N?o  hora de come?ar !   Ela esperou at que todos estivessem prontos.   - Agora, disse a professora, ns iremos fazer um prato.   "Que bom !" - pensou o menininho.   Ele gostava de fazer pratos de todas as formas e tamanhos.   A professora disse:   - Esperem ! Vou mostrar como se faz. Assim, agora vocs podem come?ar.   E o prato era um prato fundo.   O menininho olhou para o prato da professora, olhou para o prprio prato e gostou mais do seu, mas ele n?o podia dizer isso.   Amassou seu barro numa grande bola novamente e fez um prato fundo, igual ao da professora.   E muito cedo o menininho aprendeu a esperar e a olhar e a fazer as coisas exatamente como a professora.   E muito cedo ele n?o fazia mais coisas por si prprio.   Ent?o aconteceu que o menininho teve que mudar de escola.   Essa escola era ainda maior que a primeira.   Um dia a professora disse:   - Hoje ns vamos fazer um desenho.   "Que bom !" - pensou o menininho e esperou que a professora dissesse o que fazer.   Ela n?o disse.   Apenas andava pela sala.   Ent?o veio at o menininho e disse:   - Voc n?o quer desenhar ?   - Sim, e o que  que ns vamos fazer ?   - Eu n?o sei, at que voc o fa?a.   - Como eu posso faz-lo ?   - Da maneira que voc gostar.   - E de que cor ?   - Se todo mundo fizer o mesmo desenho e usar as mesmas cores, como eu posso saber o que cada um gosta de desenhar ?   - Eu n?o sei . . .   E ent?o o menininho come?ou a desenhar uma flor vermelha com o caule verde...|`|438f050c0dc88dbce8a01e0fd9361174aa	Ol!

Your mother didn't need the shot because she is +, Your sister didn't need the shot because her blood type is compatible with any blood type.  Yes the doctor would let her know if there were anything to be concerned with and they test very early on for RHfactor.|`|ffb1093eda8902d101bf2facf985ebd2aa	The first thing they check you for at your ob/gyn's office before std's when they find out you are pregnant is your blood type! The Rh factor is only a bad thing when the mom is O- and the baby has a different blood type. I am O- and I have to get a shot during pregnancy and then one after wards if the baby is not O-. Also, this usually only causes problems after your first child, meaning it takes the whole pregnancy for the mom to produce antibodies against a baby. Hope that helps.....if not, then you can search or Rh Factor online!|`|d57e29c219b565c305798b1e32e4886faa	If your sister and the baby are both O negative then what is the problem?  There is only a problem when the mother is negative and the baby is positive and it doesn't matter WHAT blood types your parents are your sister can STILL be negative.  Both of my parents are postive, my sister is postive, even my step sisters are positive, I am O negative.  My daughter had complications at birth because she was positive, I had the shot years ago but for some reason it didn't work (sometimes it doesn't) .  They didn't test me to find out if the shot had worked when I got pregnant so they didn't give me the shot again...which is why the complications.|`|e594f9bdbfc699c97ec3aec2ecaeb5f7aa	O negative is the most common blood typeby far,so it's not unusual.|`|0ee4f2f0d632d2585950da9db6ba7d74aa	Yes. To read more about it, read 'Kidnapped at Birth?' by Louis Sachar.    Anyways, it is very rare. One out of a million has blood type O-.|`|7b261705978713b5bb10a83196767f91aa	It should be both my parents were A- and i was a O- and still am. And I'm healthy|`|f161e197a2c56861b26348c686aa4929aa	Im not really too sure as to what you're asking...     Everyone, whether your A, B or O, carries a recessive O gene. For example, I am A- my hubby is B+, our daughter is O+. She received the recessive O gene from both of us.     If you are asking about a case of Rh incompatability, If your sister is Rh negative, yes she should have had the Rhogam shot during her pregnancy. If the baby is Rh positive, as you state the baby is, your sister should have had another dose of Rhogam. The reason for this is to prevent your sisters blood from developing antibodies against the foreign Rh positive blood, if she were to become pregnant again, and that baby is Rh positive. If by small chance the baby's blood crosses with your sisters blood. her body will try to attack the Rh positive blood as if were an intruder.    I hope i answered your question.

The lactose free would be best if it is just a lactose intolerance.|`|58952a9b5ed7c54f2728b9fea1ffe3a6aa	If you have decided not to breastfeed your baby, then the next best thing is to provide an infant formula. The milk in the majority of infant formulas are based on cows milk, goats milk or soy beans, which has been modified or changed with important nutrients added so that the formula is similar to breast milk in nutrient composition. (It's not a perfect match because the exact chemical make-up of breast milk is unknown.)    Many different types of milk (other than an infant formula) have been given to babies in the past, but we now know that a lot of these are not suitable for babies and can cause serious health problems.      Infant formula comes in 3 different ways:     ready-to-use (which is the most expensive)   concentrated liquid   powder (which is the cheapest)    When prepared for feeding, according to manufacturer's recommendations, these different forms of infant formula are equivalent in nutritional content.     There are two categories of formula - 'Starter' formulas are designed for babies 0 - 6 months and 'Follow-on' formula can be offered to babies older than 6 months.    Apart from the large variety of different brands of infant formulas, found on your supermarket shelves, these is also a range of specialty formulas available for babies with problems associated with prematurity, lactose intolerance, milk allergy, reflux and other more serious conditions.    With the exception of some of the specialty formulas, all infant formulas are made up to provide the same amount of energy (calories) per ounce. As your baby grows she needs more milk, not stronger milk.    There is very little difference between the different brands. When choosing a formula for your baby, the most expensive is not necessarily the best. Regulations on the manufacture of infant formula are very strict in most countries, which means the different brands of formulas are generally very similar in nutritional content. As prices can vary from store to store it pays to shop around.        Some reasons it may be necessary to change the kind of formula that your baby drinks include...     milk allergy  constipation or  lactose intolerance (following a gastro-intestinal infection).   If your baby has any of these conditions she will show definite symptoms. Without symptoms it's wise NOT to change the type of formula she's on, unless advised by her doctor to do so.        If your baby is fussy and irritable, it's tempting to change from one formula to another. However, this doesn't help. There are many reasons why your baby could be irritable or fuss with feeding, the type (or brand) of formula is rarely the reason or the solution.    You may wish to change from one brand to another because of cost or because a particular formula is easier to purchase. It's OK to do this, but make sure to check the instructions on the can, as preparation can differ between brands.    If you do change infant formula your baby's stools (poop) may change in color, thickness and/or smell.          Cows milk based infant formula is developed from modifying and treating regular cows milk. The protein quality is improved and salt levels are reduced. A range of different fats is added and the milk is supplemented with 13 essential vitamins and 11 essential minerals (including iron and calcium).    Cows milk formulas are classified as 'whey dominant' or 'casein dominant', which describes the main protein type in the formula. Whey dominant formula is easier to digest and is more suitable for babies under 6 months of age.    Although providing the same amount of calories per ounce, casein dominant formula is digested more slowly than whey dominant formula. Many 'follow-on' formulas and so called 'hungry baby' formulas are casein dominant.        Soy based formula  Strictly speaking soy is not milk as it is produced from whole soy beans or soy protein isolates. When soy based infant formula is made it is supplemented with essential fatty acids, vegetable oils, and carbohydrate in the form of maltodextrins, corn syrup solids or sucrose (sugar). Essential vitamins and minerals, including calcium and iron are added.     Soy infant formulas don't contain cows milk protein or lactose (sugar found in milk) and are intended for babies with particular health problems such as lactose intolerance or cows milk allergy. Approximately 50% of babies who are allergic to cows milk protein will also react to soy protein. These babies may need a special low-allergy infant formula (only available on a doctor's prescription).    Soy products contain chemicals which act like hormones. They are called phyto-estrogens. Although babies have been given soy formula from birth for many years with no known ill effects, it is not known if these chemicals have any long-term adverse effects on children. (Read more about recent concerns regarding soy infant formula.)    According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, "Healthy full-term infants should be given soy formula only when medically necessary".           Goats milk has a nutritional content similar to cows milk. In the production of goats milk infant formula the protein quality and salt levels have been improved and a range of different fats, essential vitamins and minerals have been added in the same way as it is for a cows milk formula.    Some babies with a sensitivity to cows milk protein tolerate goats milk formula but babies with a true cows milk allergy are frequently unable to tolerate goats milk formula as well.          If a formula fed baby is at risk of developing an allergy, e.g. if either parent or a brother or sister have an allergic condition (such as eczema, asthma or a food allergy) using a partially hydrolyzed formula may help to r|`|a1fb17d8d466c12eeed48a99ab4957c5aa	Actually the regular formula with cow's milk base is the best thing next to breast feeding, however, if your baby is lactose intolerent there is a chance that she may also be intolerent or allergic to soy.

It considered a fairly safe form of tanning in pregnancy as long as you cover up some areas. (It is much better than other methods!) but for your specific situation you may want to contact your dr. This website explains it pretty good.   "If you go for a spray tan you will be told that DHA which is the tanning component in the tanning solution is FDA approved and therefore safe. The thing which they might fail to tell you (because they dont know) is that FDA approved DHA for external application ONLY. The industry has not provided safety data to FDA in order for the agency to consider approving it for use on exposure routes (inhaling, or contact with mucous membranes such as in the nose, eyes, lips or genitals), including "misting" from tanning booths. I was in the industry for few years, and as far as I know the permit is still pending.   So, if you consider spray tanning in pregnancy, it would be advisable for you to wear panties (and not just a thong), goggles and nose plugs. You should also put a thick layer of gloss on your lips, so that spray does not reach your lips. (I presume keeping your mouth shut is pretty obvious?)"

qUabsTzCaa	Hors priode de fcondation? Une femme ne peut etre fconde (tomber enceinte) que si le rapport a eu lieu au plus 6 jours avant son ovulation et 2 jours aprs. (un spermatozoide vit jusqu' 6 jours et un ovocycte non-fcond jusqu' 24h). Soit +/- 8 jours de risque sur un cycle d'environ 28 jours.  MAIS... Comme on ne peut savoir avec exactitude  quel moment on ovule (chaque femme est diffrente, et chaque cycle peut etre diffrente chez la meme femme), il est indispensable de se protger TOUT LE TEMPS si ta copine ne veut absolument pas tomber enceinte... Elle ne va pas forcmment ovuler au 14me jour du cycle, ca peut-etre plus tot ou plus tard! L'ovulation peut se dclencher  une date imprvue. Une amie a ovul trs tard (qq jours avant ses rgles, soit au 25 jour du cycle, ce qui est tard!), et pensait ovuler plus tot. Elle a eu un rapport non-protg... Paf! Enceinte... Et ca existe aussi des filles qui ont ovul trs tot dans leur cycle.    Donc protgez-vous, ne jouez pas avec ce risque de grossesse si vous n'en voulez pas... Ne comptez pas sur l'efficacit totale de cette mthode, ou alors soyez prets  assumer un ventuel bb...    Si elle ne veut aps prendre la pilule, mettez systmatiquement un prservatif...    Bon courage!|`|QaBWEs9Naa	non, par dfinition, mais d'une femme  l'autre et d'un cycle  l'autre, la priode fconde varie beaucoup....difficile de savoir quand cela va tomber !!!! donc, il faut se protger !!!

AMWBeI62aa	actually it sounds to me like you are... but take a test -- probably on friday it should come out pretty accurate... i started sleeping a ton when i was in very early pregnancy and got food cravings right away (before i even knew i was!)... so it's very possible you are! especially since sperm can live inside of you for 7-10 days after unprotected sex (depending on how much came out of him, etc) and you usually ovulate (if you're on a regular 28-30 day cycle, which it sounds to me like you are) about seven days after the last day of your period... so ...  you just might be a momma!!! welcome!!|`|H0yNSdeTaa	If you're stupid, it's guaranteed that you're pregnant.

If you want to save money, I say that you wait for your next period or just take another pregnancy test to be sure.|`|q9cOtSDCaa	you could be but there also a chance you might not because when you have periods your not as likely to get pregnant. you are most fertile 14 days after the first day of your period.

Any company that has a certain amount of people working with them (I think it's 50)  have to abide by the family leave act. You must have worked for the company for at least a 1 yr and have over 1200 hours worked throughout the yr. to be able to fall under this act. And...if you and your company are in this criteria.... than they must give you 12 weeks of unpaid leave and hold your job for you. Paid maternity leave is the company's choice and should be in your employee handbook/packet with all the details. Your company does not have to give paid maternity leave....very sad!! You should be able to call your human resources dept and ask them of any questions relating to this. And, if your company does pay for maternity leave....usually, they pay only 60% of your pay.|`|MOX31lkNaa	i know you get 6 weeks paid, but as far as more then that, i think you need to contact the state of CA, thats the only way you will get a true/straight answer.|`|Segy3RjSaa	If you are working and pregnant, its really important to know your maternity leave rights.

Mucha Suerte!|`|zC7Sbfhfaa	En un estudio reciente realizado en el estado de Virginia, USA, se reportaron 65 ni?os que tuvieron que ser atendidos en el servicio de emergencia por accidentes significativos en relacin con el uso de andaderas, la tercera parte de ellos con lesiones importantes tales como fractura de crneo, quemaduras severas, fracturas de la columna y muerte. El 71% de estos ni?os tuvo el accidente al rodar escaleras abajo, el 21% por volcadura de la andadera y el resto por quemaduras al entrar el ni?o corriendo a la cocina o acercarse a la mesa. Un solo ni?o que fallezca por uno de estos accidentes, o que quede con lesiones permanentes, justifica que tomemos una actitud alerta ante el problema y realicemos las acciones preventivas enrgicamente.    El otro aspecto importante es el papel de la andadera en el desarrollo motor del ni?o. Existen estudios que demuestran que si la andadera se utiliza en ni?os muy peque?os y por muchas horas al da, se puede retrasar el desarrollo motor normal del ni?o. En los ni?os con problemas en el desarrollo, por ejemplo con parlisis cerebral infantil, el problema puede ser an mayor, presentndose en ellos ms contracturas y hasta luxaciones cuando utilizan la andadera.|`|HdTJ2Jtpaa	Si el bebe esta bien alimentado y sano ,no se le torcern los pies ni tendr ningn otro problema,ellos disfrutan poder moverse sin estar en brazos y aprenden mas rpido a coordinar sus reflejos , fjate como toman la decisin de dirigirse donde les gusta y como luchan por lograrlo.cuando ya quieren parase sobre sus pies ,mas o menos a partir de los 6 meses, pero algunos ni?os tardan mas que otros.|`|ApJOJ83Vaa	pues de hecho en la guarderia en la que estuvo mi hermano el peke?o nos prohibieron k el usara el andador.. lo mas preferible es k en tu ksa tengas algo asi como colchonetas en el suelo y ahi lleves al bebe a jugar y eso .. y el empezara a gatear es muy importante k gatee antes de empezar a caminar.. lo mejor seria k hubiera barras en la pared cercana a las colchonetas.. como las k usan las bailarinas pero obviamente mas bajas para que el bebe pueda usarlas y asi empezara a caminar.. pero jamas usar el andador .. suerte y saluditos !!|`|Z6QHxOdlaa	Hola    Mira,  nosotros consultamos con el pediatra y en los libros de el primer a?o del bebe y segun es contraindicado usuarlos antes de que el bebe tenga el apoyo suficiente para el mismo sostenerse debido a que si se lo pones antes de tiempo sus piernitas no tienen la fuerza necesaria para impulsarse como debiera ser , entonces solo se arrastran esto hace que sus piecitos se doblen y no tomen una buena postura, de hecho es recomendable que primero gateen y fortalescan sus musculos y  apartir del noveno o decimo mes pueden usar el andador debido a que sus musculos ya estan mas fuertes y tienen una mejor postura y  ahora si el andador les servira para apoyarse y aprender a caminar mucho mas rapido.

Cuando los bebes gatean, ayudan a los huesos de su cadera a fortalecerse para cuando llegue el momento de que caminen, es por eso que te dicen que las anderaderas no son recomendables ya que se brincan el proceso del gateo.

er2ldDqXaa	Nanda,ORGASMO  UMA TONTEIRA GOSTOSA QUE D DURANTE A TRANSA!!!  A partir da tudo  varivel  - A maioria das mulheres se sentem muito relaxadas depois do orgasmo  - A maioria tambm sente a vagina se mexendo como se estivesse chupando alguma coisa.  Mas o que interessa  a prtica:  MASTURBE-SE que vc vai sentir como  o orgasmo.  Fa?a o seguinte:  Escolha um lugar bem tranquilo, na cama  timo.  Deslize as m?os pelo seu corpo todo s para se sentir, ro?e suavemente as m?os pelos seus seios e vagina.  Na verdade vc n?o vai sentir a vagina em si (que  o canal) mas os lbios que a cobrem.  Continue passando a m?o suavemente pelos lugares onde vc sente mais excita??o (tipo os bicos dos seios ficam durinhos, o genital fica mais quente etc)  Sinta o teu clitoris ele fica na jun??o dos lbios genitais acima da entrada da vagina e mexer al d uma sensa??o mais intensa.  Com uma m?o vc massageia o clitoris enquanto passa a outra em outros locais excitantes.  Mexa com o dedo no clitoris mais lento ou mais rapidinho, o que for mais gostoso.  Quando vc estiver bem excitada vc vai notar que a vagina fica molhadinha (delcia, isso  sinal de tes?o).  Continue com o dedinho mais rpido at que vc vai notar que a tua vagina vai vazer um movimento como se estivesse chupando alguma coisa e vc vai sentir uma tontura gostosa...  ISSO  O ORGASMO!!!  Vc pode fazer isso quantas vezes quizer!  Ser vc ainda for virgem pare por a, se n?o for tente se masturbar com o dedo dentro da vagina (tem meninas que preferem assim mas a maioria gosta mesmo  s no clitoris)  E o orgasmo multiplo  quando vc goza 2 vezes em ema mesma rela??o.  Luz no seu cora??o.Abra?os.|`|JGkRpanUaa	Nanda,  Depois de ler clique no link abaixo e tire todas as suas dvidas  Transanet: O que  orgasmo? Quais os sinais mais evidentes?   Dra.

Digo isso pq passei a gravidez toda sem ter aten??o do pai do meu filho e muitas vezes, levando as maiores patadas absurdas. Me senti desolada. Ela precisa de companhia, amigo, acredite nisso!  - ela continua sendo uma mulher, com a mesma necessidade de amar e ser amada. S que ela  ainda mais bonita: ela  m?e.  - voc n?o precisa, em momento algum, sentir-se responsvel pelo filho dela. Mas n?o o despreze, jamais. Voc pode ser o companheiro dela e ter a incrvel experincia de observar uma crian?a crescer, sem fazer o papel de pai. Fique tranquilo quanto a isso.  - meu noivo e meu filho se d?o muito bem.  a coisa mais linda de se ver. E ele tem 5 anos e tem a plena conscincia de quem  o pai dele de verdade.  - Vc pode passar momentos divertidssimos  ao lado de uma crian?a, e quando ela (ou ele) dormir, vc pode "brincar"  vontade com a sua namorada.  Estou h 3 anos com essa pessoa que n?o  o pai do meu filho e vou te falar, ele foi uma bn??o na minha vida. Seja companheiro dela, sim.

Pues segn lo que dices..... uno de tus ciclos fue de 29 das y los otros fueron de 33 das.    Para saber cuntos das tiene tu ciclo menstrual, debes contar el primer da de sangrado hasta el primer da de sangrado de tu menstruacin siguiente ......... y asi sabrs de cuntos das es tu ciclo....... Por ejemplo en el ciclo en que empez tu menstruacin el 13 de Febrero, empiezas a contar a partir de ese da (si ese da empez tu sangrado) hasta el 13 de Marzo...... ese ciclo fue de 29 das.    Ahora...... como tus ciclos son mayores de 28 das, debes calcular tu ovulacin de la siguiente manera.    Si sabes ms o menos para que da esperas tu prxima menstruacin, a partir de esa fecha debes contar 2 semanas hacia atrs....... en la fecha en que caiga ese conteo, ser tu da de ovulacin y los 3 das antes y 3 das despus que la rodean sern tus das frtiles.    Por ejemplo........ si tu prxima menstruacin la esperas para el 15 de junio, a partir de esa fecha cuentas 2 semanas hacia ATRS, y el 1 de junio fue el da de tu ovulacin...... y el 29, 30. 31 de mayo y el 2, 3 de junio seran tus das frtiles.  Para lograr un embarazo, deberas tener relaciones sexuales el 30 de mayo y el 1 y 2 de junio.   El 30 de mayo es el da ms cercano a tu ovulacin, y recuerda que los espermatozoides que logren entrar a tu tero seguirn vivos dentro durante 72 horas...... descansas 1 da y vuelves a intentarlo el da de ovulacin que es el 1 de junio....... y despus el da 2.  Es recomendable que antes de esos das (antes del 29 de mayo) eviten tener relaciones, para que haya mayor concentracin de esperma para el da que tengan relaciones.    Suerte y espero te funcione......  Otra cosa...... si te das cuenta, tus das de menstruacin se van recorriendo 1 da cada 2 meses..... asi que en Julio, es probable que tu da de menstruacin sea tambin el 15.... asi que desde ahi empieza tu conteo.    Suerte!!!

4v0SsUhnaa	Amiga. Importante saber a idade de sua lindinha.  Se for bem pequenina ainda, podem ser as famosas clicas que muita paciencia, colo quentinho de barriguinha pra baixo e umas gotinhas de Atroveram (que  bem natural) podem ajudar a resolver. Se n?o s?o colicas, experimente enrola-la numa cobertinha como um charutinho. Meu bebe n?o tinha colicas mas n?o conseguia dormir sem que estivesse enroladinho. Meu pediatra disse que  pela sensa??o de seguran?a e aconchego. J se for maior, podem ser dentinhos, quem sabe? Fale com o pediatra...  De qualquer forma, uma coisa que  legal ter desde cedo  rotina para dormir. Seja ela um bebe de 2 meses ou de 1 ano. Crie uma rotina. D um banho, ponha uma roupinha confortvel (depois ela percebe que  um pijaminha e j entende que est na hora de dormir) um leitinho, conte uma histria ou cante um pouco para ela. Coloque na cama, aconchegue ela no ber?o, d boa noite e saia do quarto. Se ela chorar demore um pouco para voltar e sempre tente fazer ela se acalmar sem tirar do ber?o. Diga que  hora de dormir e saia de novo. Fa?a isso quantas vezes for necessrio... as vezes mais de uma vez por mais de uma semana...rssss  Ela se acostuma com a hora de dormir. Entende que vc estar perto dela sempre que ela precisar. D seguran?a a ela, assim daqui ha um tempo estar dormindo sozinha.  meu filho tem 1 ano e 3 meses. Fiz isso desde pequeno e ele dorme sozinho. Nunca precisei embalar madrugadas a fora. Dou boa noite, apago a luz, digo a ele que o amo muito e que se ele precisar  s me chamar... E ele vira pro canto. E saio do quarto e ele dorme sozinho....  Boa sorte.|`|Ae69dMtJaa	Que idade ela tem? Pois se for um bebe, eles gostam de dormir com movimento de carro ou de elevador,isso os acalma.   Mas o problema pode ser outro como ansiedade da m?e que deixa  a crian?a ansiosa, o ideal  criar um ambiente calmo e acolhedor para ela, e acostumar a rotina dos horrios de dormir.  Conheco o caso de um bebe que n?o dormia, e passado um tempo, o pediatra descobriu que o problema era a m?e, que  sentia tanta falta da crian?a quando ela estava dormindo, que n?o deixava a crian?a dormir. Ficava ansiosa, querendo pegar a crian?a antes dela acordar, e checando se o bebe estava respirando...  Ent?o, cada caso  um caso, voc deve descobrir o que est causando esta ansiedade na sua filha e n?o tratar os sintomas.|`|06c3f82f3a5b175375395ab6a19bf78caa	Olha vou te falar uma coisa qdo eu era crian?a eu tbm chorava mto tempos depois os medicos descobriram q eu tinha enchaqueca e chorava com dor de cabe?a, leve ela ao pediatra....Minha m?e me dava metade de um melhoral infantil qdo eu era bebe ela disse q era o q me acalmava.|`|846bb2404f63cce54c792c6682b7ea65aa	Dependendo da idade, deve vc contar histrias para ela, at que ela durma. Isso at criar um cnculo entre vc e ela. Meu filho de 22 anos, lembra de todas as coisas que fiz com ele desde a idade de 4 anos, entre sadas , passeios, histrias, brincadeiras de mesa, jogo de xadrez, e at ensinei a tocar piano. Hoje, com 22 anos, toca piano como profissional, coisa aprendida na infancia.|`|KX9stEsxaa	Querida Char,  Tenho um bebezinho de 2 meses em casa que  um chor?o!  Todas as noites passo um sufoco at ele mimir, o ch (camomila e ervadoce) ajudar a acalmar e tambm faz bem para evitar clicas mas o ideal  que voc de durante o dia porque faz a digest?o muito rpido e o bebe fica faminto e da  choro na certa!!  Depois de muito sufoco passei a analisar o choro dele , quando  de colicas seguro ele no colo sempre apertando um poquinho a barriga e tambm seguro de bru?os no bra?o , ele se acalma bastante. quando o choro  de fome aps amamentar tambem passa mas o importante  fazer o bebe arrotar porque eles entem incomodados quando n?o arrotam e podem ficar chorando mesmo de barriga cheia!  Ah se a fralda est molhada meu bebe tambm chora!!  E o pior  na hora do soninho, quando ele est com sono fica muito irritado e o que percebi  que quando ele est com muito sono n?o gosta muito do colo e prefere ou o ber?o ou o carrinho para dormir. assim que o coloco no carrinho ele costuma chorar mas com o balan?o do carrinho e uns tapinhas de carinho na bunda para ele sentir que no est sozinho resolve como um remedio para mim!!  Ah e importante  ver se seu bebe n?o est com alguma coisa mais grave como dor de ouvido, instestino preso...  Leve sempre ao mdico para tirar dvidas ele sabe avaliar se sua bebe est ganhando peso suficiente porque as vezes o leite materno n?o  o suficiente e ele pode estar sentindo fome!!  Bom...espero ter ajudado!!|`|JwkE73PPaa	A sua filha deve ter clica,dar para ela luftal,dimedicona,se ela continuar chorando desse jeito,leve ao pediatra!!!boa sorte|`|fd28b6cc7906356c9e5f48740329d114aa	Tente massagem. As vezes a crian?a precisa de carinho, de contato fisco. Isso acalma muito tambm. Deu certo com a minha filha. Esfrega o peitinho dela, os ps, passe a m?o na cabe?a, no rosto, nas costas.|`|k3trib6Faa	Leve-a ao pediatra e siga suas orienta??es.|`|izLqGLEmaa	Certamente vc deve procurar um pediatra o mais urgente possvel, podem ser tantas coisas...  Agora se vc j fez isso e ainda tem dvidas, tente criar um hbito antes dela dormir, eu tenho trs filhos e desde os trs meses que eu dou-lhes banho antes da cama, isso acalma e conforta, lembre-se tambm de que se a crian?a n?o estiver confortvel, com frio ou calor ela tambm n?o se acalmar. Ela estar com frio se as m?os e ps estiverem frios e com calor se estiver suando principalmente no pesco?o. Procure n?o deixar TV ligada no quarto, isso s d sono em idosos que no fundo tm sono de qq jeito, fa?a-a dormir no ber?o/cama e fa?a-a saber que  hora de dormir, tudo com carinho e amor.

Se ela for beb pode ser clica, pris?o de ventre, irrita??o pelo ambiente, pois beb se altera muito quando est  em ambiente estranho e/ou barulhento etc... Se ela for uma crian?a maior, pode ser manha para chamar sua aten??o, pode ser problema de relacionamento que esteja afetando; pode ser uma dor que ela esteja sentindo e n?o queira falar, pode ser na escola, etc. Ent?o, de qualquer forma o melhor  tentar descobrir com um pediatra ou, se ela for maiorzinha,  com um epscialista o motivo do choro. Boa sorte!|`|RXTjrpoVaa	Sei como  dificil, mas pode ser diversas coisas voce deve primeiramente leva-la num pediatra e explicar tudo o que acontece a ele.  minha bebe chorou muito fazendo muita manha levei em varios pediatras ,fiz diversos exames e nao deu nada era manha mesmo, dos 3 meses at 1 ano da hora que acordava at a hora que dormia ela chorava, eu pegava no colo, colocava no carrinho e ia passear com ela, cantava , brincava, via desnhos na tv, tudo isso nem sempre adiantava at maracujina dei pra ver se ela acalmava, acho que a melhor forma mesmo  rezando muito, dando muito amor a ela, conversando com calma e carinho, coloque uma musica suave no ambiente em que ela esta fazendo manha abra?ea e a aconchege em vc, nao fa?a todos as suas vontades, tente mostrar a ela que nao  chorando (fazendo manha) que ela vai ter o que quer, e quando ela parar de chorar a elogie e de bastante carinho a ela, conforme ela for crescendo tudo isso vai melhorando ela vai se interresar por outras coisas como ver desenhos e brincar com brinquedos, vai engatinhar,andar,falar... e essa manha tende a melhorar....hoje minha bebe j esta com 1 ano e 2 meses  uma ben?ao na minha vida melhorou muito gra?as a DEUS com muita f e ora?ao vc tambm vai conseguir... que DEUS aben?oe vc e seu bebe

VhCB1vByaa	N?o tem nada a ver o tempo de vida do espermatozide com quantas vezes voc tem rela??o. Nada impede que voc tenha rela??o todos os dias. O tempo de vida dos espermatozides depende do ambiente vaginal. Se estiver muito cido, eles morrem na hora. Nas melhores condi??es, permanecem por 24 horas.  Voc s conseguir engravidar se mantiver rela??es durante o seu perodo frtil, que ocorre durante cerca de 24 horas, em um dos dias compreendidos entre o dcimo dia posterior ao ltimo dia da menstrua??o e o dcimo dia anterior ao primeiro dia da prxima menstrua??o.

TkSY2ZUfaa	uhmm .. let me see if i get this... you want to leave the man who loves you & your son because you want another baby & he wants to wait?? what is this? do you love him or not? you dont go around looking for someone to get you pregnant.. Please, you're a mom now, start acting like a grown up, this is not a game. Enjoy your little baby right now.. He deserves your time & attention|`|b81734196ba16857e0c83588ad4a6dd5aa	Ok, so you found a man to act the role as your child's father. You want another child but he doesn't at the moment. Why would you leave this man? It's hard enough to find a descent man out there, let alone, act as a father to a child not of his own. Wait until your child is a year and ask your boyfriend again. If still no, then that is still your decision.|`|150WRcbRaa	Its not so great to have a large family and be a single mom.  Wait til things are stable so you can have not only the dream size of a family but the dream lifestyle.

It goes by fast.|`|676NPigPaa	not to be rude but your baby is only 6 months old and you already want another one?  r u insane?  jj.  i can't imagine wanting another with such a small baby around right now.  no i don't feel you should leave your bf because you want to have another child.  that is not a good enough reason by itself to have another child.  or to leave your bf.  i think you should wait until your baby is a bit older and see if he changes his mind.  you might as well.|`|i7EYX1Sjaa	First and foremost you need to consider letting your body return to normal before the next baby.

They grow up way to fast!|`|IamRQjVnaa	DONT leave him, He is there for you and a child that is NOT his so hold on to him!!!

Wait til your child gets a bit older before having another child, Be patient it will come

Ha milhoes de crian?as de ra?a negra esperando para serem adotadas a no Brasil, e quase ninguem as quer justamente por que a grande maioria quer um bebe branco.  Pensa melhor, quem sabe sua ado?ao no brasil sai super rapidinho. Ja q vc  livre de preconceitos, utiliza isso no seu pais. Que tal?!  Desculpe me entromenter e dar esse palpite, mas...cada cabe?a  um mundo ne. De repente vc quer adotar la por ser mais rapido, e na verdade  que pode tomar o mesmo tempo a mesmo no brasil por que vc nao tem grilo com cor.

A ado??o  o ato jurdico solene pelo qual algum estabelece independentemente de qualquer rela??o de parentesco consangneo ou afim um vinculo de filia??o trazendo para sua famlia, na condi??o de filho pessoa que geralmente lhe  estranha. Para o cdigo de menores, lei 6.697/79, a legitima??o adotiva passou a ser a ado??o plena que convivia com outro tipo de ado??o de menores que era a ado??o simples, regulada pelo cdigo civil. Na Amrica Latina o inicio das ado??es internacionais come?ou aps a Segunda Guerra mundial, conforma nos argumenta Ldia Natalia Dobrianskyj Weber: Nessa poca, na guerra mundial crian?as rf?s e abandonadas provenientes da Europa Central, Itlia, Grcia e Jap?o foram adotadas nos EUA e Canad. A Ado??o internacional continuou nos anos 50 com crian?as coreanas e nos anos 60 com crian?as vietnamitas e de outras regi?es da Asia.. Em 1980, apos o Viten? e Corei terem modificado suas leis e, com isso limitar a saida de crian?as, as agencias internacionais nesse perodo voltaram seus olhos para a Amrica Latina. N?o eram mais crian?as de Pases em conflitos de guerras, mas crian?as provenientes de Paises onde a misria, pobreza e o subdesenvolvimento estavam presentes. Embora sendo a Col?mbia o primeiro Pas que incorporou a ado??o internacional, essas ado??es internacionais onde o objetivo do adotante era conseguir um beb pelo fato de n?o poder ter filhos biolgico ou, visando o interesse da crian?a, encontrar uma famlia.No Brasil a ado??o internacional  bem vista aos olhos dos brasileiros, mas esteve ligado  clandestinidade, ao segredo e aos esteretipos e  falta de informa??o, que torna praticamente impossvel a emergncia de ado??es tardia, multirraciais e de crian?as excepcionais. O Estatuto de Crian?a e o Adolescente tambm argumentam sobre a ado??o no Brasil, e segundo cita Ldia Natalia Dobrianskyj Weber.Art.19Toda Crian?a ou adolescente tem direito a ser criado e educado no seio de sua famlia e ex-cionalmente, em famlia substituto, assegurada a convivncia familiar e comunitria, em ambiente livre da presen?a de pessoas dependentes de substancias entorpecentes. Art.20- Os filhos, havidos ou na da rela??o do casamento, ou por ado??o, ter?o os mesmos direitos e qualifica??es, proibidas quaisquer designa??o discrimina??o relativas  filia??o. Art.21. O ptrio poder ser exercido em igualdade de condi??es, pelo pai e pela m?e, na forma do que dispuser a legisla??o civil, assegurado a qualquer deles o direito de, em caso de discordancia, recorrer  autoridade judiciria competente para a solu??o de divergncia. Art.22 Aos pais incumbe o dever de sustento, guarda e educa??o dos filhos menores cabendo-lhes ainda, no interesse destes, a obriga??o de cumprir e fazer cumprir as determinadas judiciais.Na frica por causa da situa??o social de aguns Pases propriamente suas guerras e misria a ado??o serve para oferecer status  muitos famosos. Muitos tiram proveito disso, alguns fazem arrecada??es exorbitantes em Pases de primeiro mundo alegando que  para frica, Mas na verdade n?o chega na naqueles lugar. Hoje na frica existem vrios tipos de ado??es, diferentes da do Jap?o da Grcia e de alguns Pases da Amrica Latina, hoje uns adotam pessoa com fins de se projetarem o caso da Cantora Norte Americana Mandonna. A ado??o pro Madonna  o mesmo caso das ado??es de Angelina Jolie e Brad Pitt Todos voltados para frica.A frica n?o precisa e nunca precisou de dinheiros de nenhum outro Pas, o continente Africano  rico, em belezas naturais, petrleo diamantes etc. As cenas de Madonna dan?ando com as mulheres africanas, distribuindo seu livro infantil paras crian?as do vilarejo, carregando um menino nas costas e, pra finalizar, uma assistente chegando ao aeroporto com a crian?a adotada, foram constrangedoras.Existem alguns requisitos para ado??o como: O adotando deve contar com no maximo 18 anos, podem adotar os maiores de 18 anos independentemente do estado civil; A ado??o depende do consentimento dos pais ou do representante legal; a ado??o ser procedida do estdio de convivncia com a crian?a ou adolescente; a ado??o  irrevogvel; o adotante haver de ser pelo menos 16 anos mais velho do que o adotado.A ado??o  feita por via judicial sendo que a senten?a homologada pelo juiz de cunho constitutivo. Quando proclama ou decretada a senten?a de ado??o opera-se simultaneamente a extin??o do poder famlia. A ado??o feita judicialmente  irrevogvel, uma vez estabelecida  ado??o, a senten?a de ado??o somente pode ser rescindida de acordo com os princpios processuais. A morte dos adotantes ou do adotado n?o estabelece o vinculo originrio com os pais naturais.Mas o que se v, hoje nos objetivos de ado??o num  legalidade t?o pouco rala??o solidria ou amorosa e sim enriquecer na situa??o do outrem, tudo tem seu proveito. No final, Todos esses astros querem se projetar nas misrias dos Africanos. Isso Se chama Explora??o. Acho que as organiza??es de Direitos Humanos est?o usando o caso como exemplo, mas o que mais preocupa  a crian?a. As coisas foram longe demais, se conseguirem manda-lo de volta pro Malawi. A ado??o n?o esta sendo encarada como algo mais srio, como algo jurdico nem a valoriza??o da vida e sim como um meio de tirar-se proveito para projetar um e outro.A frica se torna um corpo inerte onde cada um vai e debicar seu peda?o. Que salvem frica, Pois Deus ainda ama esse povo.     Ent?o Fran... o que posso te desejar  sorte, f, e for?a! Pois s?o de pessoas como voc que o mundo conseguir se tornar melhor a cada dia! :D|`|otGBGYUCaa	Deixe essa tarefa pra Angelina Jolie...adote uma crian?a brazuca, mesmo...o Brasil, agradece...|`|JP9wE85waa	Oi, porque vc n?o adota um bebe brasileiro??

Ethymologiquement, le mot ocan vient du latin ocanus et du grec ?keanos, nom du fleuve qui, pour les Grecs, entourait le monde. Donc ce mot est un mot ancien qui  travers plusieurs sicles. C'est un mot et un prnom qui a de l'histoire.|`|c398010cd687829ea295b319d66e5a25aa	j'ai une amie qui a appel sa fille Ocane, on lui a demand si elle aimait bien la mer, sa premire fille tant prnomme Marine. Eh bien, elle n'avait mme pas fait le rapprochement et je trouve cela dommage, surtout quand on sait qu'un prnom peut influer sur l'existence de la personne qui le porte, et qu'il doit tre choisi soigneusement ... en ne se laissant pas porter par des modes !  Je connais aussi une petite Lou Berger, ?a craint !
SwbTxXjeaa	Coucou  Ce n'est surement rien, peut etre de l'acn du nourrisson.   Le mieux, c'est d'abord de consulter pour vrifier que ce n'est pas une allergie aux PLV si elle n'est pas allaite.   Si c'est de l'acn du nourrisson, c'est rien, ?a partira tout seul.     En revanche, perso, je bosse dans la cosmtique bio, on ne fait pas de produits pour bb mais je t'encourage vivement  arrter les produits du type Mustela, Bb Cadum et compagnie que l'on trouve en supermarch en raison de leur potentiel allergisant et toxique  long terme (contiennent selon les produits parabenes, parfums, PEG, PPG, huiles minrales issues de la petrochimie, huiles de silicone synthtiques...........) et de passer aux produits pour bb bio et labelliss : par exemple Weleda labellis BDIH ou Natessance qui sont Cosmbio........... Tu trouveras des produits pas bien plus chers qu'en supermarch dans les magasins bio ou sur Internet.     Pour l'hydrater, tu peux utiliser de l'huile d'amande douce en mettant quelques gouttes dans son bain (attention, choisir une huile bio labellise Nature et Progrs par exemple car il ne faut pas qu'elle contienne d'additifs).     Dernier conseil : espace les bains. Il est inutile de baigner un bb de 4 semaines une fois par jour, deux ou trois fois par semaine suffisent et cela vite que sa peau soit dcape car le film hydrolipidique de la peau de ton bb est encore en formation.|`|UsAwv8T2aa	si tu parles de l acnee du bebe, c est pas grave.

63Ac7vDyaa	As long as you do the baby dance =] on the days you are ovulating you do have good chances but it can also take time though... You have to make sure your not stressed out, your healthy, your partner isn't stressed and is healthy... The key is the days you are ovulating so every month just make sure you do the deed on those days. I've been trying for the last few months but no success yet but the doctor said in the morning is the highest amount of sperm count and to also a few days before ovulation go without sex so he will have a larger sperm count. A thing that helps me to know when I am ovulating is this website: <a href="http://www.yourdays.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.yourdays.com/</a> you just put in the date of your period and it calculates the days you will be ovulating, it helps me a lot so you should give it a try... Also check out this website: <a href="http://www.amazingpregnancy.com/pregnancy-articles/79.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazingpregnancy.com/pregnanc...</a> it gives some common tips about how to conceive and it's everything that the doctor told me also... Just take your time, don't stress and it will usually happen when you least expect it... Good luck! =]|`|l0ZuV1yaaa	There's about a 25% chance each month for a woman in her 20s.  However, that's assuming that you're at full fertility levels.  If you're still nursing your first child, or if not nursing have only had a couple cycles, you may not be ovulating yet.  You can have periods without ovulating, and that's pretty normal for the first few cycles, especially when nursing.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	25-30% chance of conceiving each month for a couple trying.  I have been trying for #2, this will be our 7th cycle.  Our first was conceived in 2 months.  You could get it the first try, hope it happens for you, good luck!|`|0KGriIC7aa	my period was on the 11 through the 17 as well with ov on the 23 i have a 26 day cycle our baby dancing was done on 2/18 2/22 2/23 and 2/24 this will be baby #3 for us and we have been ttc for 3 months. we have been "dancing" on or around fertile times each month. so i think the 25% chance is probally accurate. good luck to you  and much baby dust.

bHAlwhTBaa	You should absolutely say something to them!  And they should know better if they have any experience at all.  Chocolate graham crackers?  The point of introducing foods one at a time is to make sure that they display no allergic reactions.  I would definitely say something.  Dont EVER be intimidated by teachers (I am one), doctors, or anyone else who deals with your children.  Believe me, they have heard it.|`|FsmcCXlvaa	Your child will eat what others do while in child care. Providers should offer new food but you should also have a say of what those foods are, especially when it's basically cookies. If you have specific snacks you'd like her to have then maybe you should think about providing them. If you want to get a list together of the 'approved' foods for daycare to feed her you can talk to them about it and see what they say. After all, you are the mother and should have more input as to what your daughter eats. It's not going to do you any good getting upset over it so you should just get your list together and say something. If they can accommodate your request, great. If they can't ask if you can provide her food.|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	I would kinda lie to them so I would not sound to mean, I would say look my baby has alot of allergies, I'm bringing foods for her that I know she's not allergic to, can you please stick to these foods. I know at my daycare they have a list of kids that can only eat certain foods, I don't know if its because they actually have allergies or if its something else. Oh and you are not overacting I would be the same way, I just hate to be too direct with someone and possibly upset them.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Just say something so you don't wind up exploding all over them. All it takes is: "Please don't give my child anything containing chocolate and (insert anything you dont' want her to have). Sorry for not speaking to you earlier about it, but we would like to be the ones introducing her to new foods." Hand them a list of what is okay to give her and then leave it alone unless they continue to go against your wishes. A good daycare provider will respect the parents wishes and because you haven't spoken up they probably don't think there is a problem. Generally it's recommended not to give babies chocolate because of the allergen possibility (just like waiting on the peanut butter and similar foods).|`|AA10186411	I think you are overreacting a bit.  While I do understand that they are giving her things you asked that they didn't, its ok for her to have chocolate graham crackers.  What they are doing is against the law I do believe.  My daughter's daycare requires that I sign off on what she can and cannot have, and only gave her what I brought until she was able to eat the table food.|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	Technically, they are not supposed to give your baby anything that isn't approved by you, in case of allergies.  6 months is awfully early for them to introduce crackers.  My baby didn't get approved for crackers from the doctor until she was around 8 months.  <br>  I would start packing your own snacks for her, and tell the daycare that you only want her to have what you pack.  <br>  My daycare is awesome and they only feed what I send.  I pack a snack bag for my 10 month old, with zwieback toast, unsalted crackers, and yogurt.<br>  As far as the chocolate goes, it really isn't good for her to have it that early because of the risk of allergies.<br>  Make a list of what she can and can't have, and take it to daycare.  Tell them you want them to follow the list or you will file a complaint.<br>  I'd be furious if my daycare did anything like that.  They always ask me if she can have something before they give it to her.|`|qayCggxMaa	Say something to them.  Six month olds are usually just starting baby foods, not solid foods anyway. Plus, you are right, chocolate is definitely not a good idea at that age. At the daycares I've had my kids at, they say they can't start them on baby foods, and then on solid foods, until I sign a paper specifically stating they are allowed to.  They even had checklists of which baby foods I'd introduced at home so they could give the same ones at daycare (didn't always happen, but at least they always recorded what they did give them so I'd know).  Once they officially start on solid foods, it's hard to restrain what they give them though.|`|c3d9621b66bbf4d52837a662d4822489aa	Girl...say something! They will understand. Just don't barge in all postal on them...but let you know you don't want it happening. If they want to give you a list of their typical foods for her to try..then YOU try them over the weekends. Once she hasn't had a reaction, then you can approve of them giving her the food item. I personally made out "OK" and "NOT OK" list for my daugther's daycare so we were all on the same page. Once we got through their foods, the list came down from the fridge.|`|u94HOVz7aa	I would say something to them.  daycares are not suppost to introduce new foods to your baby.  they are only allowed to feed them foods you have previously introduced and have made sure they didnt react to them.  If they continue to do this i would contact their licensor,  who can be found by contacting your local dshs.
1tmX7xbRaa	that's bull you are right. there is no way that a child support worker or welfare worker would stop a paternity test. shes just making crap up. he just needs to take her to court to get it court ordered. this way if she still refuses to take the child she will be held in contempt of court and can be put in jail|`|oMGasIcjaa	That is a crock of crap.  They all have the right to know who the father of that child is.  She is making excuses so that he doesn't find out he is not the father because he is paying for it.  You hit the nail on the head!!!

It has been long enough that it should show up as negative or positive by now. The body can be very deceiving sometimes. Yes some of what you have described is indicators of pregnancy, such as the cramping and the nausea. Sometimes there will also be a clear discharge in early pregnancy 2+ weeks. <br>  <br>  However, the breasts don’t start to get sore until you are several weeks along (4+) and your nipples don’t really start to get “dark” until the end of the first, beginning of the 2nd trimester. They not only will get dark, but the areola will get much larger as well. <br>  <br>  A test will be the best indicator. It is my advice to take a test now and if it shows negative to take another one in 6 to 7 days. Good luck.|`|8qfQkJQiaa	i recently just found out i was pregnant on feb. 5th.

9AHGuAEraa	I would make an appointment with the doctor and ask him about it, the sooner the better. It's probably nothing to worry about, but just in case it is, you should get it looked at and possibly fixed as soon as possible, so it doesn't turn into a bigger issue. Especially since he's a preemie, and is therefore at a slightly higher risk for problems such as this.

bTlhBX3daa	I will be 31 weeks on Friday, and I think my son is dropping this week. I don't think he has dropped all the way, and this is my first pregnancy, so I'm not even sure that is what's going on. <br>  <br>  But I have all the signs:<br>  My belly looks lower to me.<br>  My baby's movements have all been down low for the last 3 days.<br>  I am breathing easier.<br>  I can now fit my palm flat on my chest between my breasts and my belly.<br>  I am feeling pressure down there everytime I walk or stand up.<br>  <br>  The only sign I don't have is an increase in urination.|`|hoX7hoINaa	She could have. Some ppl drop very early but dropping doesnt indicate that she will come any sooner than the others.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	My baby dropped at about 27weeks - she has stayed fully engaged. This is my first pregnancy - so its quite early.<br>  <br>  My bump looks alot lower than it did before too.<br>  <br>  Your baby has probably dropped|`|oWAUb6vpaa	It's possible that baby dropped, which doesn't necessarily mean that s/he will be preterm as well as the first two, although it shouldn't be disregarded considering your history. <br>  Also, baby could have simply changed positions and so seems a little lower than before, (in which s/he could also move out of this position at any time as well since it's still early and bab had plenty of room to move around.) <br>  <br>  Baby's drop at different times. I believe I dropped just a few weeks before my kids were born and they both came at 38 weeks. BUt like I said before, every pregnancy, baby and mother are different. <br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations on your new baby!|`|mItsW20naa	The doctor always told me that your baby doesn't "drop" the 2nd and subsequent pregnancies until labor, if at all. I didn't seem to drop with either of my children...|`|SihmWU0Baa	even thou im 6 months my bump moves up and down alot!|`|yNXIxcsYaa	Hi there, congrats!  I believe my son dropped about week 36 - I have pictures during the week before, and the next week my belly was much lower.
GJKsizL7aa	I am always amazed at the number of people that circumcise their son so he looks like daddy.  Does daddy shave his pubic hair so that junior won't wonder why his circumcised penis is not hairy?  What does daddy do about erections?  Seems like junior would have an inferiority complex from seeing daddy's big 'un.<br>  <br>  Get over it people.  Junior does not care that he does not look like daddy because junior knows, just by looking, that he does not look like daddy, even if he is circumcised.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	If it ain't broke, don't fix it.|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	It all comes down to what you feel. It was the right decision for my fiance and I but I know it isn't the right decision for other parents. If you don't want to do it, let your mother and sister know that you will not be doing it and end the conversation with that.|`|K4zsztkRaa	I don't think it's good for anyone who doesn't chose it on their own for their own body.<br>  I don't think circumcision should be forced on anyone, it's not right for someone to chops bits off of somone else without thier permission.<br>  <br>  <br>  Why are they giving you crap?<br>  Honestly a lot of females I know are for circumcision, yet a vast majority of males on this site and that I know want it to be illegal. So honestly I wouldn't care what some other female thinks.<br>  The thing I don't get is a female saying a man needs to have part of him penis chopped off, I mean they have ALL of their genitals, and if you asked them to cut anything on them up they would throw a fit.<br>  <br>  You stick with your guns.<br>  honestly your mother is from a time where they thought circumcision saved males from everything bad, tell her to do some research on the topic and she will find that it's completly unnecissary and in most men's minds, it's barbaric.<br>  <br>  -Connor|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I think it's wrong when done to infants. It's painful (they don't use proper pain relief in the majority of cases), there's a risk of complications, no real benefits, and it's taking away the boy's choice not to mention some of his sexual sensitivity. So yeah I think it's a bad idea. Stick to your decision, you've made the right choice. It's nobody's penis by your son's! He should say what happens to it. Just tell them the decision is final and you don't want to discuss it. They will get over it. Most men in the world are never circumcised and are absolutely fine. Good luck!<br>  <br>  Harrie|`|q1YDp1y3aa	I would recommend NOT circumcising your son. The benefits do not outweigh the risks. One analysis found that for every 9 boys who might be spared a UTI by circumcision, another 12 boys at the least (the upper estimate was 40 boys) will experience severe complications from the circumcision. Thats great if your boy is one of the 9, but horrible if he's one of the 12. UTIs can be treated by antibiotics quite effectively. Botched circumcisions are much more difficult to fix. Its also worth noting that 99% of intact boys will never get an infection, compared to 99.9% of cut boys. That means you would have to cut 100 boys to save just one of them from infection. Thats 99 boys cut for no reason at all. Out of every 1000 boys who are cut, one will contract a UTI anyway.<br>  <br>  Only 50% of boys nationwide are circumcised. Girls of your son's generation will likely have an entirely different view of circumcision as girls from yours. Just because you think intact is "gross" and "unsanitary" does not mean the women of your son's generation will. after all, think of all the differences between you and your parents. Did you know that when your grandparents were young, circumcision was very uncommon?<br>  <br>  Next, it is VERY painful to an infant. Most doctors still don't use any anesthesia, those that do rarely offer adequate anesthesia because the only stuff that works is not safe enough to use in infants for such a "minor" procedure. Further, some of the pain meds offered to infants aren't even recommended for use on babies! Some doctors argue that it has been done "for thousands of years" without anesthetic- what they neglect to tell you is that a medical circumcision can take over 15 minutes to complete. A Jewish ritual circumcision, by contrast, takes under 60 seconds to complete (and the baby is given wine) Here is some info on the pain.....<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2...</a> (note in this one that even infants offered pain meds for the procedure showed signs of post traumatic stress!)<br>  <br>  You should also know that studies have shown that the most sensitive parts of the male anatomy of ON the foreskin- NOT the head of the penis. By cutting off the foreskin, you remove a mans most erogenous genital tissue. Here is a study about that.... (note that other studies found no difference, but they neglected to test the sensitivity of the foreskin- they only tested the glans penis of intact and cut men and didn't pay any attention to the foreskin at all) <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte...</a><br>  <br>  You should know that infant boys are EASIER to care for when they are intact. The foreskin does not retract until late childhood or even puberty, so you do nothing special, just wipe the outside of his penis clean and leave it alone. Furthermore, to prevent painful and bleeding erections later in life, doctors are now commonly leaving more skin behind- in a cut boy this means you may have to push the left over skin back at every diaper change and clean beneath it to prevent it from adhering or infecting. The very thing that mother's think they avoid by circumcising! In short- Intact = wipe like a finger, NEVER retract Cut= vaseline, clean thoroughly, push back remaining skin to prevent adhesions etc (the last step perhaps for several months or years)<br>  <br>  Here is an excellent tutorial on the basics of intact care and circumcision....<br>  <a href="http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag..." rel="nofollow">http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag...</a><br>  <br>  Another factor in your decision is that circumcised boys experience a 12% increase in their risk of MRSA infection. MRSA is commonly picked up in hospitals (where circumcision is performed in non-sterile conditions) and has been known to kill adults. I wouldn't want to deal with it in an infant. 12% is a BIG risk, the risk of a boy "needing" a circ later in life is WELL below that- under 1%. <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers...</a><br>  <br>  The so called "benefits" of circumcision are generally trumped up. A big one now is that it "prevents" AIDS. All the studies showing "benefits" like this have been poorly designed and inconclusive. Also, for every study that finds a "benefit" there are more studies that find no benefit. <a href="http://www.icgi.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.icgi.org/</a><br>  <br>  It is rather eye-opening to see how circumcision first became popular in the US to begin with. It was virtually unknown in this country until the 20th century. This slide show takes you through the rise of circumcision.... <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=f4unKTMpBGA" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/watch?v=f4unKTMpBGA</a><br>  <br>  Finally, you should watch a video or two of the procedure so you are fully informed of what your infant will go through. I will warn you that these are graphic. If you can't handle watching them as an adult, why would you expect your infant son to endure them?<br>  Gomco Clamp- <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=..." rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...</a><br>  Plastibell- <a href="http://newborns.stanford.edu/Plastibell...." rel="nofollow">http://newborns.stanford.edu/Plastibell....</a>|`|2N6KEoVqaa	I chose to circumcise my son because he will look like his dad and I won't have to be sure to ask my eleven year old if he is washing his penis correctly. (At that age they don't even like to shower, and any mention of their penis would be mortifying)|`|9scpRClxaa	That it is a personal decision and should be made by the person attached to the foreskin in question.  It should only be performed in cases of: gangrene, cancer, severe frostbite, or if the part is so mangled that it cannot be saved.  Otherwise it is cosmetic surgery and should only be performed with the informed consent of the person whose body part it is.  Routine infant circumcision is a human rights violation--and no, no exceptions for "religion or culture"--if there are none for female circumcision, why should there be for male?|`|EwmHsEoiaa	They obviously are less informed about circumcision.  The more people know about it, the more they turn against it.  To those on the fence, I would watch this video, called "The circumcision decision":<br>  <a href="http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=-5395565256830319025&ei=si6cSZCZMYnojgKZmcCUDg&q=nocirc&hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?doci...</a><br>  <br>  It is not easier to keep a circumcised boy clean , it is harder.  Especially if things go wrong:<br>  <a href="http://www.circumstitions.com/Complic.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumstitions.com/Complic.ht...</a><br>  <br>  There is no care at all for an intact boy.  A few things you need to remember:<br>  The foreskin is attached to the glans at birth (they have to break this seel to perform the circumcision - this is excruciatingly painful - not that the pain is the worst part of circumcision )<br>  You should never pull back the foreskin or try to clean under it.  It requires no care.<br>  The foreskin should be left to become retractable on it's own , it should not be forced.  The ability to retract it occurs any time up until the end of puberty.  <br>  Once it becomes retractable, there is little care - just wash it like any other body part.  It is not dirty - if it was then women would be a lot dirtier.  Most men worldwide are intact and have no problems.<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/care/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/care/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/normal/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/normal/</a><br>  <br>  The foreskin has a function.  It is an important part of the penis.  It contains many nerves on it's underside.  When the foreskin is moved up and down it is very pleasurable.  Circumcised men have lost this ability as there is no gliding effect.  So they have to use artificial lubrication to masturbate or even in sex.  See here for the importance of the foreskin:<br>  <a href="http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/naturalresources" rel="nofollow">http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/...</a><br>  <br>  Without the foreskin protecting the glans, circumcised men lose further sensitivity.  The glans dries out.  It also brushes on underwear causing the skin to toughen.  See here for the full damage done:<br>  <a href="http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm</a><br>  <br>  The foreskin also has a role in sex.  Women and men enjoy sex more when the man still  has his foreskin:<br>  <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F/doctor_northrup.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F...</a><br>  <br>  There are a lot of myths about circumcision, you can read the truth here:<br>  <a href="http://pharmtips.com/2008/11/27/dispelling-myths-about-circumcision/" rel="nofollow">http://pharmtips.com/2008/11/27/dispelli...</a><br>  <br>  Most men worldwide are intact (80%) .<br>  All medical associations do not recommend circumcision.<br>  In Canada and Australia the newborn circ rate has declined to less than 10%<br>  In the USA it is declining - currently at 55%.<br>  It isn't done at all in Europe.  Men in Britain, France and Germany are doing just fine without having their penis mutilated.<br>  Non-religious circumcision only became popular in English-speaking countries in the late 1800's, to prevent masturbation among other stupid reasons.

They are talking out of ignorance. I've noticed so often people justify the practice with "I've heard foreskins can get infected" or "I've heard uncircumcised males get more STDs". They are making important decisions about their son's genital integrity based on rumoured half-understood myths! <br>  Circumcision is the amputation of the foreskin, not extra skin but an integral part of the penis; measuring 15 square inches in an adult, over half the penile skin, including the most sensitive parts of the penis. The foreskin is packed with nerve endings, special anatomical features like the ridged band and has a unique elastic gliding action, allowing it to slide on itself and act like lube. This action is what most males use to masturbate with. Circumcised males use what skin they have left, except those who are cut so tightly that they have to use lube or just rub it dry. The intact male can stroke the entire length of his penis using his foreskin and also has the option to use lube too, if he wants to. During intercourse the foreskin acts like lube on entry and may act as a dam, preventing lubricating secretions escaping from the vagina. In one study women reported that sex with an intact partner was gentler and more satisfying since he doesn't have to thrust as hard to feel enough stimulation. Removing the foreskin turns the surface of the glans from an inner mucosal membrane to outside skin. Newly circumcised adults usually go through some weeks of intense discomfort as the glans is constantly exposed to rubbing on clothing, until it develops a thicker keratin layer and becomes less sensitive.<br>  Not one major medical organisation in the world recommends routine infant circumcision anymore. The US is the last western nation still doing this to about 50% of its newborn males but even there rates are falling and many insurance companies no longer cover it, because it is a waste of money. Sadly they often still don't use anaesthetic and when they do it’s risky and ineffective. It's child abuse.<br>  The penis forms as one organ and at birth the foreskin is usually fused to the glans like a fingernail to its finger. So there is no cavity for germs and dirt to collect in until it separates naturally later, at an average age of 10. Only the boy himself should retract it and then he can be taught to skin back and rinse with plain water regularly.<br>  Misguided attempts to retract too early, often by doctors and nurses, are the main cause of damage to boys’ foreskins and the real main reason for childhood circumcisions.<br>  To perform a neo-natal circumcision the circumciser has to rip the foreskin away from the glans with forceps. Then the foreskin is either cut away or clamped until it falls off. Both methods cause the baby extreme pain and his raw glans and wound sting every time he urinates. It's quite common for the raw edges of the cut foreskin to fuse to the raw glans during the healing process, forming skin bridges or tags. These complications and other more serious ones are often not found till puberty and do not show up in statistics. <br>  More serious complications, though not common are immediate. Some babies lose their penis to infection, bleed profusely (often because they are haemophiliac) or even die each year.  <br>  The claimed benefits of circumcision are a beat up (based on flawed studies) and don't really exist but medical authorities have worked out that the overall complication rate is higher than all the benefits claimed by the pro-cutting advocates. One by one the claims are disproved but they come up with more and keep quoting the old ones despite the evidence against them. For example you have more chance of dying from a circumcision or losing your penis from infection than from penile cancer. The rate of penile cancer is higher in the USA than in European countries where less than 1% of males are circumcised. The US Cancer Society does NOT recommend routine circumcision.<br>  A very recent study in New Zealand followed a cohort of boys through life from birth to age 32. About 40% were circumcised. The intact males had a slightly lower rate of sexually transmitted infections than the circumcised but there was no significant difference.<br>  Using surgery to mutilate the genitals instead of washing in a modern western society makes no sense. Normal intact male genitals are even easier to wash than female ones and the same substance, smegma collects in the genital folds of both sexes. A few intact males have problems with tight foreskin but this is only a tiny proportion. The condition can now be almost always treated with simple stretching exercises, sometimes in combination with a steroid cream.<br>  I wish I'd been given the chance to choose for myself. Intact men can choose to get cut at any time in their life, though most have no desire to do so. Many men resent being circumcised.<br>  Your son will grow up with many intact friends and there is every chance he would resent t|`|XvePaWWXaa	Well let me tell ya. My son is 5 months old and DH and I had made the decision to circumcise him so he will "look like daddy". My father also had to be circumcised in his 50's so that also influenced our decision. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately when he was born he had jaundice and had to be on the bilirubin lights for a few days and they would not circumcise him in the hospital because of it. Circumcised babies have a tendency to not eat since they are in pain and with his jaundice, he NEEDED to eat. Anyway  .... we planned a week later to have it done at the dr's office. <br>  <br>  My DH Googled circumcision and looked at photos. He was horrified at the procedure and asked if I cared if we didn't have it done, he just couldn't hurt him like that. It's not my foreskin so I didn't care. It's his job to teach him how to keep things properly clean and if he chooses at 18 to get circumcised, we will happily pay for it. <br>  <br>  Everyone was totally horrified we didn't have it done, I even got a good reaming out from my neighbor (after telling me a really great story about how the dr. screwed up her grandson's circumcision and he had to have it done twice) about it. Reality is, man has lived for thousands of years with a foreskin. He's not gonna die with it left on. <br>  <br>  It all comes down to personal choice, good luck!|`|AA11987492	I chose NOT to have my son circumcised. It is not medically necessary, and the very few UTI's that it prevents are negated by the rate of complications. People say that it is easier to clean, but that is NOT the case! With an natural penis, you just wipe like a finger, but with a circumcised one, you have to have gauze, Vaseline, push back skin to prevent adhesion's, and think about it... a fresh wound being soaked in urine and feces all day?!?!?!?!?!?!<br>  <br>  The main reason you hear about boys needing to get circumcised at 3 or 4 is because of misinformation. Some old school doctors and nurses tell you that you have to forcibly retract the foreskin and clean under it every diaper change. not only is that not true, it is dangerous! At birth, and sometimes until puberty, the foreskin is attatched to the head of the penis like your fingernail is to your finger. It is NOT supposed to be retracted. It is like this in order to keep the head of the enis protected from urine and feces. Around the time a boy is potty trained, most boys are retractable. (you can pull the foreskin back) is this a coincidence? NO!!! There is no need to clean under the foreskin before it can be retracted because nothing can get under it. Do we need to clean under our fingernails? (the part that is actually attatched) no, because there is nothing to clean.<br>  <br>  <br>  It is becoming less common is America, so the locker room thing just wont hold up. Even if he does get made fun of for it, is it not our job as parents to build a healthy body image? If your daughter got made fun of for having small breast, would you immediately get her a breast augmentation? What are they making fun of anyway? At least he has a whole penis....<br>  <br>  Looking like daddy, now this one makes me laugh! Ah, the ignorance of this statement! Since when do toddler boys look even remotely close to a grown man? What are you gonna tell him when he asks like he doesn't look like mommy or sissy??? And since when do teenagers compare penises with their father? This argument makes NO sense!!!<br>  <br>  Your son can stay STD free with the use of a condom (which he should be using regardless of his circ status!) and still have his foreskin.<br>  <br>  The foreskin is not just a useless flap of skin, it is a vital structure of the penis. <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/</a><br>  <br>  If people are so worried about infections, HIV, and Cancer, the why why don't we give all baby girls routine mastectomies? That would eradicate breast cancer, which kills thousands every year, and is MUCH MUCH more common in the developed world than infections of the foreskin, penile cancer, and HIV put together!<br>  <br>  The real kicker for me though, was the fact that I believe that we own our own bodies. Who am I to make that decision for my son. It is HIS penis, so it is HIS decision<br>  <br>  As for religion, no one has the right to practice their religion on MY body. Your freedom of religion ends at someone elses body. That may be your child, but it is not your penis to sacrifice, kwim? What if your son doesn't grow up to be jewish/muslim? I was raised in a strict christain home and I am now atheist, it happens all the time...|`|CfZn9kK5aa	I will be honest..

XOV0F6raaa	En gnral quand l'un des 2 parents est gaucher le bb peut l'tre, mais  3 mois c'est encore t?t pour le voir, moi je me suis rendue compte que ma fille serait droitire quand vers 1 an elle a commenc  faire du dessin ou plut?t du gribouillage , elle tenait son crayon de cette main, o quand elle tapait dans un ballon aprs avoir su marcher vers 13 mois, encore le pied droit, et quand elle tenait un gateau dans sa main .

pzLDXL6gaa	I haven't researched medications during birth to know enough. I think it's a personal choice but I have heard some negative things happening from using medication so I would try to do it without but who knows what would happen. If I had drugs it definitely wouldn't be an epidural.<br>  <br>  Circumcision I feel is wrong when done to an infant, there's no reason, it's not cleaner, and there's the risk of complications. So I wouldn't do it.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|K4zsztkRaa	When you go into labor, the things that go between you are the baby are very minimal, the baby ono longer needs you at that point. So when you are filling up with pain killers it's not going to reach the baby so I don't see an issue with it. Plus most women are screaming for it when that time comes anyways.<br>  I think in a day and age where we have it, use it if that's what you want.<br>  <br>  I know I'm not a girl but LOL if I ever had a kid I would want what ever they could give me and as much as possible hahaha.<br>  <br>  Doesn't look wonderful.<br>  Plus when you give birth your pelvis actually opens and moves, THAT in it'sself is probably painful aa all HELLL<br>  <br>  As for circumcision.<br>  I am a guy who had it done when  I was a baby.<br>  I will never forgive my parents for doing it. (altho theres more behind that whole story)<br>  I believe it' smy body, it's attached to me and my parents job is to protect it, not cut it off without my okay.<br>  It's mine and I don't understand why they thought it was okay to take it away from me. Especially because it significantly reduces sensitivity, and there really is no medical need for it.<br>  <br>  No medical asociation in the world reccomends it and neither does the american academy of pediatrics.<br>  <br>  The way I see it, there is no reason to cut off a normal, healthy, natural part of a child body without serious medical need.<br>  <br>  Id rather keep my foreskin i don't care what anyone "says" the benifits are.<br>  It's my body and I'm the only one that can make  that choice, same with all other males.<br>  I feel it's a human rights issue.<br>  <br>  -Connor|`|3cLE5L7Saa	I am going to get an epidural if I feel that I need one...i'm staying away from the IV drugs because they pass to baby, my doc said its safe and would be out of his system by the time I give birth, but still....I say no.  And I'm not having him circumsized.  Lots of people will tell you that its more hygenic to get it done, but its not.  My boyfriend isn't and he's never had an infection because of it, and its never dirty or smells or anything, and his 7 year old isn't either, and he said he's never had a problem.  Circumcision is cosmetic surgery.  My insurance doesn't even cover it, because of that.  Most men in the world are not circumsized AND the rates of getting it done in the US have dropped like 50 percent in some amount of years.  It also in some cases reduces pleasure to get it done. (if you know what I mean)....Just because they won't remember it, doesn't mean it doesn't hurt baby now.  In some places they do it to females too.....imagine that! HELL NO, right? Also, it looks the same circumcised or not when it gets hard.  If he wants to have it done when he's older then thats his choice.|`|q1YDp1y3aa	I'm against meds during birth, I think it can complicate the birth. Its really your decision though, as it's your body. I would recommend NOT circumcising your son. The benefits do not outweigh the risks. One analysis found that for every 9 boys who might be spared a UTI by circumcision, another 12 boys at the least (the upper estimate was 40 boys) will experience severe complications from the circumcision. Thats great if your boy is one of the 9, but horrible if he's one of the 12. UTIs can be treated by antibiotics quite effectively. Botched circumcisions are much more difficult to fix. Its also worth noting that 99% of intact boys will never get an infection, compared to 99.9% of cut boys. That means you would have to cut 100 boys to save just one of them from infection. Thats 99 boys cut for no reason at all. Out of every 1000 boys who are cut, one will contract a UTI anyway.<br>  <br>  Only 50% of boys nationwide are circumcised. Girls of your son's generation will likely have an entirely different view of circumcision as girls from yours. Just because you think intact is "gross" and "unsanitary" does not mean the women of your son's generation will. after all, think of all the differences between you and your parents. Did you know that when your grandparents were young, circumcision was very uncommon?<br>  <br>  Next, it is VERY painful to an infant. Most doctors still don't use any anesthesia, those that do rarely offer adequate anesthesia because the only stuff that works is not safe enough to use in infants for such a "minor" procedure. Further, some of the pain meds offered to infants aren't even recommended for use on babies! Some doctors argue that it has been done "for thousands of years" without anesthetic- what they neglect to tell you is that a medical circumcision can take over 15 minutes to complete. A Jewish ritual circumcision, by contrast, takes under 60 seconds to complete (and the baby is given wine) Here is some info on the pain.....<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2...</a> (note in this one that even infants offered pain meds for the procedure showed signs of post traumatic stress!)<br>  <br>  You should also know that studies have shown that the most sensitive parts of the male anatomy of ON the foreskin- NOT the head of the penis. By cutting off the foreskin, you remove a mans most erogenous genital tissue. Here is a study about that.... (note that other studies found no difference, but they neglected to test the sensitivity of the foreskin- they only tested the glans penis of intact and cut men and didn't pay any attention to the foreskin at all) <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte...</a><br>  <br>  You should know that infant boys are EASIER to care for when they are intact. The foreskin does not retract until late childhood or even puberty, so you do nothing special, just wipe the outside of his penis clean and leave it alone. Furthermore, to prevent painful and bleeding erections later in life, doctors are now commonly leaving more skin behind- in a cut boy this means you may have to push the left over skin back at every diaper change and clean beneath it to prevent it from adhering or infecting. The very thing that mother's think they avoid by circumcising! In short- Intact = wipe like a finger, NEVER retract Cut= vaseline, clean thoroughly, push back remaining skin to prevent adhesions etc (the last step perhaps for several months or years)<br>  <br>  Here is an excellent tutorial on the basics of intact care and circumcision....<br>  <a href="http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag..." rel="nofollow">http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag...</a><br>  <br>  Another factor in your decision is that circumcised boys experience a 12% increase in their risk of MRSA infection. MRSA is commonly picked up in hospitals (where circumcision is performed in non-sterile conditions) and has been known to kill adults. I wouldn't want to deal with it in an infant. 12% is a BIG risk, the risk of a boy "needing" a circ later in life is WELL below that- under 1%. <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers...</a><br>  <br>  The so called "benefits" of circumcision are generally trumped up. A big one now is that it "prevents" AIDS. All the studies showing "benefits" like this have been poorly designed and inconclusive. Also, for every study that finds a "benefit" there are more studies that find no benefit. <a href="http://www.icgi.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.icgi.org/</a><br>  <br>  It is rather eye-opening to see how circumcision first became popular in the US to begin with. It was virtually unknown in this country until the 20th century. This slide show takes you through the rise of circumcision.... <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=f4unKTMpBGA" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/watch?v=f4unKTMpBGA</a><br>  <br>  Finally, you should watch a video or two of the procedure so you are fully informed of what your infant will go through. I will warn you that these are graphic.

I look forward to my next birth and very much want to do it natural as well.  I did have my son circed and I regret it.  I should have left it alone.  Now I see that it is basically just cosmetic surgery to suit the parent's taste and there really is no medical benefit.  He ended up having an adhesion where the skin tried to reattach back to the head of his penis and the doctor had to almost re-circ him in the office.  Poor baby.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	i loved my epidural (until it wore off..=<.....)<br>  <br>  and i think circumcision is a choice only for the parents to make.<br>  <br>  personally, i chose to have my first son circumcised and i'll do the same with the son i'm carrying now.. you just need to research the out come of both and make that choice for yourself.<br>  <br>  but i do think its better to go with the circumcision than not.|`|k1cDEnLPaa	I feel that whatever is best for the mother is best for the baby, and whatever is best for the mom varies. I personally m due tomorrow and am hoping to be able to have a natural birth, but have looked into analgesics if I need pain relief. I would like to avoid and epidural bc of the side effects.<br>  <br>  Circumcision should be again, what is best for the family. I am Jewish and Jewish boys all get circumcised, so my son will be as well. But I know many families who have not had their sons circumcised.|`|h5cFkP35aa	an epidural can give you great relief and relax you during childbirth. i dont believe it is natural, but it's your choice. the risks on the baby are very low also. <br>  <br>  a circumcision is a good idea for hygiene and will help you in the long run. it will also make him more comfortable with himself in the future.<br>  <br>  And julians story is one in a million.|`|532XA7lkaa	Epidural or not...the result is the same...a beautiful baby!  I had an epidural and slept the entire labor, they woke me up to push and it was very calming.  I got it at about 4 centimeters at which point I was hyperventilating from the pain...at ONLY 4...so I got it.  I had planned on it anyway.  Best decision I ever made.  I was able to enjoy the labor and delivery that way.  I didn't want to remember it as the most painful experience of my life....and I don't....so goal accomplished.  I'm now 15 weeks with my second and will be signing up for that epidural like yesterday :)<br>  <br>  My son is circumcised.  It is more hygienic in my opinion and looks much better.  It is completely cosmetic, but he had some anesthesia for it...so it was painless....only red for a day afterwards.|`|AA11828121	I will be getting an epidural, it's just a personal choice, for lack of better wording, I don't want to feel the pain. <br>  <br>  If I do have a boy I will be getting him circumcised for hygienic reasons, it's much easier to keep the penis clean and much easier on the boy growing up. I only feel this way because my ex husband was not circumcised and it really bothered him and his mother who is now a NURSE said it was the wrong decision due to infections he had when he was a child which were due to it.|`|yKS2UI87aa	I think everyone is different and what is right for one may not be right for another. I have no problems with epidurals for pain because I feel having the mom stressed due to pain would not be helpful for the child either. Circumcision I am for as it is easier to keep clean. Also you leave room for them getting picked on cuz they are different. Kids can be cruel|`|g4mvfBQ8aa	Some women try to do the natural thing and that's cool for them but I say bring on the epidural!  I don't have anything to prove to anybody by not getting some pain relief when I am hurting.  If its safe for the baby and good for me, I am definitely ok with it.  As long as you don't get it 30 minutes before delivery, it will not affect baby.  Circumcision is okay with me too.  My husband will want it to look like his and I like the way a circumcised penis looks.  The other is just ugly to me.  LOL!|`|umGzyElZaa	I think it is whatever YOU feel is best.  <br>  You know yourself better than any of us. You know the level of which you can tolerate pain. If you feel that you can do it without that's great! But, if your like me, and you feel that you wouldn't be able to take it then get the epidural. Remember the less stress that you cause for yourself, the less stress the baby will encounter. So, personally I believe that its all about you, and how you will "perform" best. <br>  My Dr did tell me this. The amount of medicine that you get in an epidural is VERY minimal, and that a lot of the time women will try to go without, wait too long, and then want something. Sometimes there is still time, but a lot of the time she said that they are given other methods which the level of med is higher and your baby ends up getting more. When I was pregnant I decided because of that, and I know that I am not good with pain to get it. AND on top of that my sister in law had both of her kids natural and each time whatever they DID give he made her so sleepy, she was half way asleep the entire time!<br>  Needless to say, I ended up needing a c-section. So I had to have it! HAHA. <br>  But do what you feel is going to bring your little sweetheart into this word the best. You know your body! Its gonna hurt! Can you hang in there? Do you feel like you can bear through it and still enjoy and have pleasant memories of bringing your baby into this life? OR Do you really feel like you cant? That you know that you may get exhausted, and stressed out and think you should have one?<br>  You will make the right choice! Talk to your Dr if you need to!<br>  <br>  About the circumcision. My husband is not. I let him choose since he has been through life, and knows all the ups and downs about not being circumcised. He chose to have it done to our son.  He said he has always felt uncomfortable about it in school sports, with women, and didn't want our son to go "though" that. Things are changing though, about 50% are and 50% aren't! It really serves no medical purpose. I still have mixed feelings about it, either way I suppose I would worry!<br>  Congrats and good luck with everything! God Bless!|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	On my 4 previous pregnancies i only had a epi and drugs on the first and that to me was a big mistake. I dont like not being able to feel my legs. And i dont like feeling drugged up! I had my last 3 100% natural. Wa the best decison ever! And if i make it to that point with this prgnancy ima have a natural birth!  I got all 3 of my boys circumsized. More of religious reasons than anything!
fdxQlQZ5aa	awe! Do you guys do alot of things together? Its always a good thing when 2 people are friends and know eachother well, sometimes they eventually fall in love! You know this guy way better than I do, so there are alot of ways you can take this. If you guys do alot together, and maybe are walking together on a trail or whever you walk together, and you really want to just take a chance; Just gently slip your hands into his and hold them without saying anything .. Theres a good possability he just wishes you would do that, but maybe is way too shy to do something like that himself. If he doesn't think about you the same way you do, he'll just tell you he doesn't think of you in that way.<br>  <br>  I really think you should try it, let me know what happens, good luck and I'm so positive it will work out the way you want it to =)|`|15qceXaOaa	hug him back and tell him u like him when ur walking togeter|`|8oAlBL91aa	That wasn't just any hug that was a good type of hug.

h5cFkP35aa	first of all, get away from all the drama. <br>  second, get a pregnancy test yourself. there are reliable ones for $1. <br>  you dont need him in order to test. if you are pregnant, then you have something to talk to him about.|`|8zODA3dIaa	i dont know where you are from but if you have a dollar tree they sell them there for only a dollar|`|ztzEloj5aa	take a test<br>  its the most annoying answer- yes i know<br>  i know your looking for experiences from other women but you will not get that here- all your going to get is the answer- take a test- sorry but its true- people don't want to share their experiences- they only want to tell you take a test- its sad- why ask the question if that is the answer you are going to get?<br>  people on here cant and wont help you out except give you the most obvious answer|`|Q05rrSX4aa	I would borrow like $10 from someone else.  Or see a doctor at planned parent hood, or some free clinic and get a test done there.  Before you tell your ex boyfriend anything....confirm it first.  Stress can also delay your period.  So that may be what is going on.<br>  <br>  Good Luck:)
kuZgNRvgaa	because daycares lie through their teeth! likely they have way too many babies and the bare minimum state required adult ratio (if that) and so they leave your baby in a crib or swing until he cries himself out. then of course when you come they tell you he was perfect all day.<br>  <br>  why the thumbs down for the truth? daycare is horrible|`|VwMkiLFPaa	If your daycare doesn’t already do this, then ask them if they’re okay with doing so. When my son was under a year, we’d fill out reports when we dropped off. The daycare staff would fill it out during the day and we’d know exactly how things went during the day when we weren’t there. It asks about anything that may have happened at home they should know about. They circle if they napped or didn’t nap. If they peed and how many times, pooped and how many times. <br>  <br>  Because a baby can’t talk, the paper helped tons. And they also pass journals back and forth so any questions you have, you can write it out. And they answer back. <br>  <br>  Daycare is a big deal for a newborn. He could be a bit of everything. And I see no reason why daycare would lie. But if you want, do as I suggested. It eased SO many concerns for me. And I liked having that communication back and forth. It just made me feel better!|`|0vLU2GGGaa	Is your child in daycare most of the day?  It happened to my daughter when she was baby.  She was always fussy at home but never at daycare, i figured that the reason could be i work full time and she was in daycare all day, and by the evening when i took her home, she was already very tired (not sleeping too well at daycare) and over stimulated by all the activities, that's why she got fussy.<br>  <br>  Talk to the daycare teacher and make sure he has enough naptime during the day.|`|FsmcCXlvaa	The odds are that your daycare provider has their hands full and isn't holding your child all the time. Likely, it's been a long day, baby is tired, a little grumpy and wants attention from the parents. I'm a daycare provider now but I wasn't several years ago when my son was little. He went to daycare and I experienced a lot of what you're talking about. Now that I'm a provider I can tell you that it could be the time of day. Some kids are grumpy in the morning and happy the rest of the day. It sounds like your son may need a little cat nap in the evening, or less stimulation. <br>  <br>  Daycare has no reason to be dishonest with you. However since they are a part of your son's care I think you should talk to them about what's going on. Maybe he is due for a nap or snack, maybe he spent enough time in a saucer, swing, etc and just needs more attention from you. Talk to the provider about how your child spends his day, what he enjoys and try to trouble shoot it that way. Open communication is great especially when the needs of the child contstantly change.|`|AA11080680	Hi, I am a professional childcare provider in my home. I love the idea about the journal. With my infants I fill out a daily report, it states how may bottles and times, bowel movements, nap times, etc.. this really helps my mom's out a lot. Also I have 2 infants and 4 preschoolers, I do not have the time to sit and hold a baby all day. Plus I do not believe in holding a baby all day the interact with all the kids. I think it is, is that your baby is in childcare for what up to 10 hours a day? When you get him home your ready to relax for a few minutes however your baby wants your attention, he wants to be held by you it sounds like your getting tense and stressed out and than your darling little baby feels all that negative tension and it upsets him and yeah he gets fussy wouldn't you???? You need to put yourself in your babies shoes and just think of what or how you would feel after being away from home all day. Take an 1/2 hour spend that time with your baby, than once your relaxed he's relaxed than you all can be happy. Try it might take a week or so to get use to it. But you are your child's first teacher, his parent, and his voice. <br>  Your welcome in advance.

AA11327039	If you know your cycle very well, have sex on the day you ovulate or even the day after.  Doing this, increases your chances of having a boy.

Probably get a good look at him. You'll of course hear the heartbeat,but you won't find out the sex yet,a little too soon.|`|hoX7hoINaa	Depends how far along you are. If you are still in first trimester, you will see a peanut shaped thing and hear the heartbeat. If its your 20 week ultrasound, they will do measurements, check for 10 fingers and toes, make sure organs are all there and functioning, check the heart for 4 chambers and beating, and at the end check the sex if you'd like to know.|`|AA11828121	You're only due a few weeks after me so i'm surprised you haven't had an US yet. I had one around 10 weeks and I have another on March 13th to find out the sex of the baby. It's possible you might find out the sex since you are further into your pregnancy. But normally they would just measure it and let you see the heartbeat and then give you the pictures to take home.<br>  I'm 18weeks which would make you about 16weeks so it will be more of a baby than a little bean :)|`|PYtJ2GoFaa	It depends on how far along you are.

My first ultrasound I was 7 weeks along and like another person had said expect to see a small kidney bean. I had another ultrasound at my 12 week visit and by then it was so much different, actually looked like a tiny human at that point with all of the limbs flailing around! Very surreal!

Congrats!!!|`|CdJtH0xdaa	Hi Val!<br>  I remember when my wife (girlfriend at the time) and I went to our first ultrasound. You should expect so much. It's the first time you're going to see your baby. I remember that when I saw my son for the first time on the screen, it was the happiest day of my life. I believe that when I saw him on the screen, I knew why I had a life; it was to be a father. It was very exciting. It's a magical moment in a parent's life, so remember it by getting a picture of the ultrasound. I still have my son's ultrasound picture, because I never want to forget when I first saw my son.<br>  Congratulations, and good luck!<br>  =)|`|Vm7vpqsmaa	You will be able to see something. Are you 9wks post conception or 9wks post period? it does make a difference. <br>  The sono tech will look around a bit and make measurements. Then ask to see the screen while they look around. It is a lot easier to see what they are talking about when you watch as it moves. Definitely look for the heartbeat. <br>  I loved every sono I had, though Iwould get nervous at first when the tech made the measurements.|`|oWAUb6vpaa	It depends on how far along you are. Baby's development and growth is rapid and so changes every week. They'll look for the heartbeat and may let you hear it right there, too. <br>  <br>  Don't be afraid to ask questions during the ultrasound, not that they can answer everything as your doctor can and should, but they can answer some. It's YOUR baby!  : )  <br>  <br>  Congratulations, mom!|`|mbGOEZSAaa	Depends what type they do. If it is a vaginal (which they do in early pregnancy), they will put something inside to look around. If just on the belly, some warm goo and they will put the thingy they move around on your belly. They will look at development of organs and size. It will actually take longer than you think. Mine was about 1/2 hr.<br>  Congrats!|`|wKuQC4yTaa	youll see the babys heartbeat flutters and will look like an oversized tadpole.|`|h5cFkP35aa	you will hear the heartbeat and see your little peanut on the screen. enjoy!|`|sIr2fWh6aa	To hear the heartbeat and to see the small "kidney bean".

2pxiK9waaa	Buy flushable wipes--those usually help. I'd try to get more fiber in his diet so his poop is the right consistency. It's usually pasty like that if kids eat artificial preservatives and sugar. I'd cut back on those things and go with more veggies and whole grains. <br>  <br>  In preschool, teachers DO sometimes help with wiping.|`|AUsvrW8faa	Baby wipes.  He will have to take a couple baby wipes and wipe with first then use the tissue.|`|AA10622097	They make special flushable wipes for that, I think Huggies make them.|`|AA12127693	Try the flush-able wet wipes - I think (thought) they worked great!|`|afHiVPugaa	My Mother would say that this is happening because he is having an "incomplete evacuation".  In other words, he's not pooping out ALL the poop that needs to come out.  Maybe he needs to eat a peice of fruit or some apple juice so that he has more complete poops.  A healthy poop should look like a banana.<br>  <br>  And...baby wipes.|`|BrYMh9pRaa	Check his bottom closely next time. Make sure there is not a problem with part of the bowel protruding outside where it shouldn't, even just a tiny bit. It should all be pink skin down there.

smsUZG4Iaa	well the clear stuff is either you or him.. i would see the GYN about the smell. you may be getting an infection..|`|Q05rrSX4aa	If you have a 26 day cycle then you would most likely ovulate around day 12, your fertile times are probably from cycle day 8-16 (or around there).  I am surprised you saw sperm, its microscopic, you can't see it.  I am sure you were just referring to the semen.  It can live inside you for up to 7 days.  You could be pregnant, take a test when your period is due.  And I would see a doctor about the smell.....|`|3q7x0Zfwaa	Your husband does not have to actually come for you to get pregnant.  Pre-ejaculate fluids come out of the penis during sex. That may be the clear stuff you saw. Anyway, the best thing to do is wait for another period. If that doesn't happen, take a pregnancy test. If you just can't wait, but a pregnancy test to ease your mind!|`|zDOwJ7ZBaa	do a home pregnancy test they are 99% accurate. If your having unprotected sex you can be pregnant. Myself i am 5 months pregnant and i found out a couple days later with a home pregnancy test. The clear stuff if your discharge with his sperm. Thats what makes the baby!|`|aHWmqYY2aa	unprotected sex can always lead to a baby even with pre come, go to the doctors about the smell.|`|A0tWlG94aa	wait for your periods and if they dont come...do a pregnancy test...good luck<br>  x
EwmHsEoiaa	First off - turn off CAPS LOCK, it feels like you are shouting.<br>  <br>  "Its a crazy world" says that she does it because she is Christian.  Actually Christians are not supposed to do it.  It says so in the New testament.  And the Catholic church see it as mutilation.  <br>  <a href="http://www.noharmm.org/christianparent.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.noharmm.org/christianparent.h...</a><br>  <br>  Farmer Tim says the boy will be the odd one out.  He will not be .  The rate of circ in the USA is 57% so it is abut half and half now.  if more people knew how damaging circumcision is then it would be lower still.  Also boys don't look at each other's penises.  <br>  <br>  I'd recommend you and your boyfriend watch this video together, called "The circumcision decision":<br>  <a href="http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=-5395565256830319025&ei=si6cSZCZMYnojgKZmcCUDg&q=nocirc&hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?doci...</a><br>  <br>  Here are some of the common myths cited by pro-circ fanatics:<br>  <a href="http://pharmtips.com/2008/11/27/dispelling-myths-about-circumcision/" rel="nofollow">http://pharmtips.com/2008/11/27/dispelli...</a><br>  <br>  Most people worldwide (75% of men are intact) including myself are intact and are doing just great.  Neither I nor anyone I know had had a problem.<br>  <br>  The foreskin has a function.  It is an important part of the penis.  It contains many nerves on it's underside.  When the foreskin is moved up and down it is very pleasurable.  Circumcised men have lost this ability as there is no gliding effect.  So they have to use artificial lubrication to masturbate or even in sex.  See here for the importance of the foreskin:<br>  <a href="http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/naturalresources" rel="nofollow">http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/...</a><br>  <br>  Without the foreskin protecting the glans, circumcised men lose further sensitivity.  The glans dries out.  It also brushes on underwear causing the skin to toughen.  See here for the full damage done:<br>  <a href="http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm</a><br>  <br>  The foreskin also has a role in sex.  Women and men enjoy sex more when the man still  has his foreskin:<br>  <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F/doctor_northrup.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F...</a><br>  <br>  Finally make sure you and he are aware that there is no care required for an intact boy.  You should not pull the foreskin back or clean under it.<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/care/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/care/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/normal/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/normal/</a><br>  If you follow this no care advice then everything will be fine.|`|OTiLeig8aa	As a guy I am circumcised and totally happy with it. I am sure I hurt bad when it was done, but I don't remember the pain so it is irrelevant.<br>  <br>  I personally feel you would be best having your 4 year old circumcised. He is still young and not only will he feel weird not being done in regards to his younger brother, but he will feel even more alienated when he realizes most of his friends are circumsized.<br>  <br>  Yeah, he will feel like he missed out.|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	The choice IS half yours.<br>    You dont have to do whatever these fathers want.<br>  <br>  If you dont want the baby to go through the pain then you tell the dr that it can only be done with a topical applied !   You make the decision about what happpens to your child.<br>  <br>  If you dont want your 2nd son to be different than the first then dont have him circumcised !   The father needs to start respecting your wishes it sounds like to me !|`|9scpRClxaa	More likely that your younger son will wonder why you did not protect him than your older son will wonder why he was "left out" when they learn what circumcision is.  The only person whose opinion counts in this is the man attached to the penis in question (that would be your newborn son's) and he can make the decision himself when he comes of age.|`|RsqrFLc9aa	As a Christian, it is a religious matter to me that of course an infant boy should be circumcised. I realize this may not be a factor in the decision for you and the boy's father, however, there are many other reason's to go through with the circumcision. First of all as a previous student in a class on the psychology of human sexuality I can tell you that it is a lot cleaner for your son and is a preventative measure against a load of diseases and infections. Also, if this procedure is done while he is still an infant and is not on the move as much it will pain him a lot less as well as cost less since there will be no need for stitches. Here is a website address that tells of both the draw backs and benefits of infant circumcision. <br>  <a href="http://www.circinfo.net/pdfs/Guide_for_Parents-US.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.circinfo.net/pdfs/Guide_for_P...</a><br>  <br>  If your real worry is about how the older brother might feel than I suggest you discuss with him that every baby/child is special and different from others. Some are different and special on the outside, some on the in and that his brother might have a special difference from him. Most children in his age group are very understanding is someone talks to them about changes ahead of time.|`|TsjqzanQaa	You "respect his father's feeling about wanting his son circumcised."<br>  <br>  How about respecting your son's own body and leaving the decision up to him when he's old enough?<br>  <br>  I consider circumcision of infants to be assault, sexual molestation and mutilation; I was a victim of it.<br>  <br>  Noone should have healthy and normal parts of their body cut off without their permission.<br>  <br>  I suffered more than the usual loss of sexual sensitivity, which ruined my sex life, and I urge others to consider the adverse effects and complications that result from circumcision, as te doctors never disclose them, and in fact suppress them.<br>  <br>  While your partner, the baby's father, may be content with the status of his own genitals, he more than likely didn't have any choice, and circumcision was forced on him as an infant.<br>  <br>  He may not know about the diminished sexual sensitivity that he has as a result of the mutilation, but forcing it on another is wrong, and just because he is circumcised is no excuse or justification for perpetrating this on a helpless infant.     Nowadays there is more information about the adverse effects to blithely ignore it, as in the past.<br>  <br>  Look at the site CIRCUMSTITIONS, and you will see some of the reasons for not perpetrating this on your son.<br>  <br>  Please don't let your son be another victim; there have been too many.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|7rCeCVl2aa	If you don't make a big deal out of it then he won't either.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	No you should protect your newborn and not circumcise him either! There's no reason to do it and as you know from your 4 year old it's not necessary or beneficial. Why not just tell the father you don't want to do it? It's not his penis, it's your baby's penis. Fathers and sons rarely compare so looking like Daddy is stupid. Tell the father all you're doing is leaving it in the default state and leaving the choice up to the boy.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|IlyS8KGzaa	I'm sure someday your older son will wonder why he looks "different" down there when comparing himself to his younger brother, but I would just explain to him when the time comes, that everyone looks different, and leave it at that.  I too am against circumcision, but I have a little girl so I don't really have to worry about that.<br>  <br>  This is a tough question.  I'm honestly not really sure how I would handle the situation.  What I wrote before was the only thing I could come up with.|`|K4zsztkRaa	I wouldn't circumcise your new son. It's not necissary. Also it's not your husbands penis, or yours, it's your sons and only he can make that choice for himself.<br>  <br>  My dad is circumcised and so am I. I hate it and this it was a horrible thing for my parents to do. Just becuase my dad liked it doesn't mean that I will.<br>  <br>  Also i think it would cause a little bit of an issue when your son grows up might want to be uncircumcised like his brother.Then you wil have some crap to take from him.<br>  (your new born is the one that will feel alienated because he would be cut up, circumcision isn't always better like people think, also if he wants it done when he's older he can go get it done, but he won't have the option to undo it, which is why it should be his choice, seeing as it is his body)<br>  <br>  I wouldn't do it. Plus you should tell your husband how much sensitivity is lost when you get circumcised. It's a lot<br>  <br>  <br>  -Connor|`|q1YDp1y3aa	Many mothers have mismatched sons, although usually its the other way around (the eldest is cut and the younger are intact). Generally the simply explain the one boy had an operation on his penis and the other did not. Your situation is a bit more difficult because when they are old enough to ask WHY you allowed one to be cut, you have no good reason. Quite frankly, your 4 year old is not going to match his new father, I'm not sure why the baby needs too. I would simply put my foot down and tell them absolutely no circumcision for any of the children. Whose penis is it really anyway? Why should the father's feelings override the babies right to an intact body? Seems to me you aren't doing it for the benefit of the baby, but for the benefit of the father, which is a pretty poor reason to put a child through that sort of pain and an irreversible procedure. -Neb
ysUg2Rgraa	My 10 year old got released early last week. She had appendicidis and was fighting a high fever and discolored urine.

So she  could imitate what they were doing to her with her own equipment. I brought her band aids, too, she loved band aids, and put them all over everything.

u94HOVz7aa	i worked in a daycare that did that.  they would just take a different item from the infant room each day and put it in the box for the babies to explore.  <br>  examples:<br>  toys, pacifiers, baby wipes, diaper, hat, sponge, paper towel (watch incase they rip a piece off), rock, formula powder (messy but fun), ice cube (but may work better just putting that on the high chair tray), cotton balls (WATCH CLOSELY)...........<br>  you can use just about anything, just make sure it doesnt have small part the baby can get out of the box and put in it's mouth.

VpDhPP8baa	The second blood test usually involves fasting overnight and then having a blood sample taken, followed by the glucose drink. a one hour wait then another blood test, then a further one hour wait. <br>  So slightly over two hours in total and 3 blood samples.<br>  <br>  If this one comes back high, you will be diagnosed with gestational diabetes GD (as i just have been).<br>  You then have to monitor your blood sugars a couple of hours after every meal and these results will determine whether you are able to manage GD with or without the help of insulin. Monitoring is done with a tiny pin prick of blood, and it doesn't hurt. But it does take a couple of days of getting used to it.<br>  <br>  Generalised advice is to ensure you have moderate exercise , lower your sugar intake (no sodas, lollies, chocolate etc)  and choose healthy carbohydrates (whole grains, limit breads etc) in smaller portions and spread more evenly throughout the day. 3 main meals plus approx 2 snacks. best way to do this is without going hungry is to up your protein (eggs & meat) and vegetables, and remove some of the carbs- potatoes/rice/pasta/ bread from each meal. But do not completely remove the carbs as they fuel your body<br>  <br>  If your choices are good this is maybe all you have to do, and you'll be informed by around 38wks if baby is big or not.<br>  <br>  Just remeber that GD is caused by your hormones and whilst you can do your best to control it you may still need some temporary assistance (insulin). <br>  98% of GD vanishes directly after birth with no side effects to mum or bub.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the tests and the forth coming birth|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	i have to do the same thing <br>  <br>  by doing this next test, they are taking precautions and want to make sure that you do or do not have gestational diabetes<br>  <br>  if one of the three tests comes back abnormal than you have gestational diabetes<br>  <br>  there is a change in your eating habits. not that you have changed them enough already :)<br>  <br>  my baby measured bigger as well and i dont think its related at all|`|24a78cc0007d10093367ee4cc375a0f6aa	You have to repeat the test to confirm the results.  There are lots of resources on the web to answer your questions about gestational diabetes.  It is manageable with a good diet and exercise and sometimes careful monitoring and insulin.<br>  <br>  Here are some helpful websites/resources:<br>  <a href="http://www.diabetes.org/gestational-diabetes.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.diabetes.org/gestational-diab...</a><br>  <a href="http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/women/pregnancy/complications/075.html" rel="nofollow">http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/gestational-diabetes/DS00316" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/gestati...</a>|`|h5cFkP35aa	it doesn't mean that you've officially developed gest. diabetes. i'm not sure how the next test results will be, not a doctor. if you do need to change your lifestyle it will only be temporary and will most likely consist of diet restrictions, especially on sugar. i didn't have gest. diabetes and my baby is measuring larger than usual. might just be a big, healthy baby. good luck.|`|joPJtKemaa	I am in the same situation.<br>  <br>  By failing the 1 hour test does not mean you have gs diabetes, that's why the docs are sending us to do the 3 hour one to have a more accurate result.<br>  <br>  They say usually most women pass the three hour one.|`|aWkp6AJOaa	if you ate something really sweet the night before or that morning that could cause the test to come back elevated.<br>  the three hour test is just more sticks & longer waits.  i would make sure you drink lots of water the day before & not to eat much sweets either.  when you drink the extra water it helps with the blood when they stick you.<br>  this does not always mean you have gd<br>  if it comes back & you have gd then you will need to watch what you eat & eat a diabetes type diet.  your dr should provide you with lots of info on what he/she wants you to do.<br>  gd does cause babies to be rather large that is why they try to catch it early so it is not so big you can't deliver the baby naturally.<br>  i found this on web md. <a href="http://diabetes.webmd.com/guide/gestational_diabetes" rel="nofollow">http://diabetes.webmd.com/guide/gestatio...</a><br>  good luck & hopefully it will all be ok!|`|g4mvfBQ8aa	The three hour test will be the determining factor of whether or not you have developed gestational diabetes.  If it does come back that it is elevated as well, then you will have to watch your diet.  Most gestational diabetics are controlled with diet but sometimes do need medications.  It will just depend on how elevated your sugars are.  Your OB will keep track of this if you are found to have GDM.  It definitely could be why your baby is bigger, diabetes is a risk for having larger babies.  Just take it all in stride, do your best to be as healthy as you can for your baby and communicate with your OB about any questions/concerns you may have in the future.

oiJITSNZaa	I would be a little leary on using Clomid on my own. Speaking from my own experiences one month I was on it, it caused cysts on my ovaries. Therefore I could not start the next month right away till those cysts cleared up. And the only way those cysts were found was through the routine ultrasounds throughout the cycle. I had many negative experiences with Clomid and thus would not want to mess with it out from under a doctor's care...I value my reproductive system more than that! Hope this helps u decide!
ylg9ejceaa	It sounds like you have legitamit concerns with your daughters well being and safety. Just stress that you arent trying to take your daughter out of his life. You'd still like for him to be able to see her. Because I hope you will still allow him to be a part of her life? Its important for your daughter to still have her dad in her life. Of course safety is the #1 priority. maybe the court will impose some sort of anger management classes for him. And once he's straight she can be allowed to visit him. In the mean time maybe a supervised visit for him with a court appointed monitor is the safest bet? Good Luck.|`|wqchA8B7aa	I'd say your chances were pretty darn high.|`|vXhu9ac5aa	If he ends up having an attorney it could get alittle sticky but as long as your prepared (as you are) with documentation, evidence, and be sure to dress professionally....you'll get it for sure!  The courts usually favor the mother anyway ...especially over an abuser!  On the other hand, they don't like to separate children from their parents and may give him alternatives like anger management or assign a caseworker to the situation.<br>  Just be professional!|`|AA10529198	Depends on the State and the Judge.  But, even though you would like it to sound like it is.. It is not a slam dunk.  Unless there was seriously harmful behavior, I would save your time !!!|`|AA11080680	Hi, do you have a parenting plan set up through the state the 3 of you live in? If not why not? That is one of the first things you should of taken care of after you were not together with her father. However you might want to look into doing that. Call an attorney and ask if they will talk to you over the phone for free, maybe the receptionist can even help you. It sounds like you have all of your ducks in a row and you have been more than generous with him for letting him spend as much time with her as you have. However your daughter does not sound like she is in the safest environment when she is with him. You should be the custodial parent and he should pay for 1/2 of her schooling. Full child support and 1/2 of her medical bills or any other extra stuff like ballet, swim lessons, soccer etc...and have her every Wed. for a few hours after school and than 9am Saturday morning to Sunday night at 6 pm.  <br>  I hope I have helped you and good luck, walk into that court room with your head held high, dress like a professional, and whatever you do, do not smack talk her daddy!
hoX7hoINaa	In 1st and 3rd trimesters no more than once an hour unless in last few weeks of pregnancy.|`|9EVcTnUWaa	Yes due to two reasons. First before the baby is big enough to be putting pressure on your bladder, there is a hormone released to make you go to the bathroom more to help prevent against UTI's and bladder infections and kidney infections which can be really serious during a pregnancy. So yes, During pregnancy from the first few weeks through the last months you will have to go to the bathroom more than you're used to.|`|mbGOEZSAaa	Definitely! The baby is pushing on your bladder and everything else in there.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	very super normal|`|bfe4229ae3c11cd32b5b7cb0d5f12298aa	yes it is normal to wee more often, this is down to hormone changes and the growing uterus pressing on your bladder. this will continue through your pregnancy.|`|cn1jWO4Haa	Yes. not only normal, but expected.|`|jf6IwtYiaa	Yep it's normal because is pushes down on the bladder.|`|AnfGA5uHaa	YES!!! the baby is sitting on your bladder!! duh, your are going to pee more!|`|3ydmsRA1aa	yes, this happens alot when your pregnant.|`|SnanuNKiaa	OH most Definatly!!!!!! god i run to the bathroom close to 20 times a day, and that not including after i go to bed!!! urg, you want to talk about tired, try waking up every other hour to go pee!!!|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	definitely. <br>  <br>  but if it stings or there is pain go to dr and check for a UTI
h5cFkP35aa	yes. as much as they dont want to admit it, plan b is just an abortion in a pill. it basically cleans your uterus and starts your cycle fresh.
7C0inbg6aa	It has to do with how tall you and are what your weight was before conception. Go to babycenter.com and in the search engine type in weight gain calulator, under "Top Tool's there will be a Weight Gain Estimator. I used that and so far it seem's to be accurate & I am 38 weeks along. Good Luck.|`|LUR9MVaiaa	I'm just about 16 weeks and bc of extremely bad morning sickness i've lost 15 lbs and my dr says i'm doing fine, it's ultimately up to ur dr but i was reading today at 16 weeks you should roughly have gained about five lbs +/- one or 2 so i'd say ur probably right on. i use a few different sites and the one i read that on was www.babycenter.com <br>  <br>  another one i like is www.americanpregnancy.com or something like that <br>  hope it helps :)|`|FGjanFY1aa	A friend of mine is 25 weeks pregnant.

703c83fe1a687f02e99bde09a9966ecfaa	If you can afford it, DEFINITELY get a Medela.  Because they are a company whose sole purpose is helping women initiate and prolong breastfeeding, it's no surprise that they make excellent pumps.<br>  <br>  I love the Medela Freestyle, if money is no object. It has a bunch of bells and whistles, such as a backlit timer and meter to show the strength at which the pump is set. It also has a memory button, so if you have a good pumping session you can go back to the same settings for next time. It is also a hands-free pump. You can use it while you type emails, write thank-you notes, whatever. It'll run you about $380.<br>  <br>  If you just want the very best pump for the money, I'd go with Medela's Pump in Style Advanced. It's about $280, but in my opinion is about as good for efficiency as the Freestyle. It just isn't as fancy.<br>  <br>  Both pumps feature two-phase expression. If you nurse a baby you'll notice that he first sucks fast and shallow to stimulate your milk let-down. Then he will start sucking longer and deeper when the milk is flowing. The pump simulates that, and it increases mom's comfort as well as decreasing the time spent pumping.<br>  <br>  I love the Medela pumps because I've used them and sell them at work.  Go to medela.com for more info.<br>  <br>  And the length of a pumping session:  15 minutes of actual pumping, tops.  The amount pumped depends on the mother.|`|ixlC9pW5aa	Honestly, its probably just your supply.  Mothers make enough milk to supply their babies, so she could only be drinking 2oz in half an hour.  If your not sure about the pump, though, try the medella.  I used it and the one from the hospital and they both worked about the same.  I also was told that if you get WIC, you can sometimes rent a hospital grade pump from them.  I tried, but my particular county didn't offer that.|`|dwdLkvgPaa	if she is only 3 weeks old why are you pumping to start with?  and yes the Medela is way better than that....I can pump both sides in 10mins and get around 6-8oz...just nurse her on demand and wait to start pumping...pumping is no factor in how much milk you are producing any way your baby is way better at getting the milk to come down than your pump....|`|6hrpoVUZaa	Playtex pumps are junk. I've heard of lots of mom's getting their nipples torn up from them and they don't efficiently remove milk. Try a medela or ameda!|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	Do not pump for a 1/2 hour to an hour!  You are supposed to pump for 20 minutes max, I usually just do 10 minutes.  If your baby is 3 weeks old you shouldn't be pumping at all, nurse her directly on demand and don't worry about how much she takes.  If the diapers are ok then she is eating enough.  <br>  <br>  Once you do start pumping (in preparation of work?) than just do double sessions for about 10 minutes.  I get anywhere from 4-10 oz depending on the time of day and how much my daughter nursed in the morning.  It is very normal to only get 2 oz a double session, I happen to have an oversupply.  More frequent short pumping sessions = more milk.  Not longer session = more milk...<br>  <br>  Yes, the Medela is more effective.|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	Are you sure you are getting "letdown" when you pump?  I had a hard time with that.  I couldn't pump more than an ounce or two, but if I got letdown, I'd pump 6-7 oz on each side!  If you get that same tingly, almost burning sensation during pumping that you get when your baby nurses, then you are getting letdown.  If now, that is why you are not pumping much.  If letdown is the case, try looking at your baby while you pump, or at a picture of your baby, or even having your baby nurse on one side, while you pump on the other.

52bAHCaUaa	For a preemie you have to go by their corrected age. So they are only 2.5 months old. So definitely not supposed to be sitting up, starting solids or anything like that! <br>  <br>  Sucking their lips, hands, or anything else they can is normal for all babies when they are hungry! My daughter does the same thing when I take her bottle away, its like how dare you! lol.<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~<br>  I really don't recommend starting solids. We tried solids with my little girl a few weeks ago, but I stopped because I don't feel she is ready for it. It was recommended by her pediatrician which is the only reason we introduced them in the first place. She is not sitting up yet either.|`|X6as2nOAaa	If they are 5 months old then I think you can start solids, my baby was 4 months old when I did. They cry because they are stillhungry, they smack their lips because that is a way to communicating to you that they are hungry.|`|oUtEVKDHaa	give them more milk
LDiBjNf5aa	Nearly impossible. But not impossible, but the chances are so small it's very odd of you to be worried about it. Worrying can delay your period, and just make the whole situation worse.<br>  <br>  If having very safe sex still worries you, I think you should stop having sex as stressing that much is bad and takes away from what should be an enjoyable experience.|`|SnanuNKiaa	yes. it is possible. its always possible. Contraceptives are only so effective.. and SHE was using a condom, is there somethign we should know??!! LOL sorry couldn't resist, im sure you meant to say YOU used. <br>  <br>  ANYWAYS, she could have an extremely irregular cycle, or released more than one egg this cycle, which could very well happen during her period. but its never a for sure thing.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	no insults here..<br>  <br>  as long as you took all of those precautions, you should be fine.<br>  <br>  but do consider getting put on birth control, just in case the condom breaks. you'll want that back up plan.|`|ztzEloj5aa	take a test<br>  its the most annoying answer- yes i know<br>  i know your looking for experiences from other women but you will not get that here- all your going to get is the answer- take a test- sorry but its true- people don't want to share their experiences- they only want to tell you take a test- its sad- why ask the question if that is the answer you are going to get?<br>  people on here cant and wont help you out except give you the most obvious answer|`|hoX7hoINaa	I would say its extremely doubtful if you used protection. Only way it would be possible is if condom broke or his *** leaked onto you, and still possibilities would be slim.|`|QfJrdA1Yaa	why would you have sex with a girl that is on her period? what is wrong with you?<br>  <br>  you would probably get AIDS from a blood transfusion. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Praise Allah|`|h5cFkP35aa	no. you have to be fertile at the time of conception which is usually 1-2 weeks after your cycle.|`|fBkHZ3jKaa	descriptive explanation<br>  <br>  a)the chances of getting pregnant during period are much less than in other week of the month, but still it's not impossible<br>  <br>  b) spermicidal condom should kill all the (low) possibilities left from point <br>  <br>  c)plus, you pulled out? then there's no way of her being preg. It would be a miracle, honestly, like one in a million.<br>  <br>  Not completely IMPOSSIBLE, but very, very unlikely<br>  <br>  good luck|`|cI7CmNGyaa	Frankly girls can't get pregnant during period. Their brains would release hormones to trigger the period (thinning of the Uterus lining and stop producing ovaries).<br>  <br>  So the answer's no. She can't get pregnant during her period.|`|FfxgHWGxaa	never say never c how the girl go's(wait ntil her next period is due)
nwuL7M7saa	I feel like 7pm is an early bedtime for anyone execept an infant. She may be upset with you because her sister has a different, later bedtime. She may have not mentioned it to you though, out of respect. Talk to her, see how she really feels about it.|`|pd6hbk0saa	Bedtime is 7PM?<br>  I honestly think it should be 11.|`|6a809f8f4c97f768092102e120596872aa	r u serious? 7 oclock bedtime for a 15 year old i would send my 5 year old to bed at that time|`|lONUiE0raa	no!!!! thats not..im sorry if i sound really bad right now but the oldest child should always have more priveleges.and your freshman is growing up shes gonna want to be on the phone and b talking to friends or guys on the phone til later hours..i think you should talk to her on how she feels about the whole thing..like sit her down and aske her the same thing your asking a website..and try to negotiate with her...|`|ArmOXDoaaa	I was 15 years old in boarding school where my bedtime was 11pm.  <br>  <br>  7pm is dinner time... a good portion of the year, it's not even DARK out by that hour.<br>  <br>  Someone of her age should be getting 9 hours and 15 minutes of sleep a night.  If she wakes up at 7am, she should be going to sleep around 10pm.|`|AA10943329	different people need different amounts of sleep. It really is a personal thing. But a younger sibling having a later bedtime is a bit unfair|`|rSWX0CZ7aa	Teenagers need 8 1/2 to 9 hours of sleep.  So she really doesn't need to be going to bed that early unless she gets up at like 4 in the morning, which I doubt she does!  I'm going to assume if she's in high school that she has to get up at about 6:30-8:00 in the morning (different high schools start at a lot of different times, so I don't know).  So I'd say somewhere around 10 pm would be more reasonable.  I'm 17 and I go to bed at 10:30 p.m. and get up at 7:00 a.m, and that's always enough sleep for me.|`|IngvPTXBaa	I don't think it is good to go to those extremes. if your daughter is responsible enough she will get her schoolwork and relaxation time done on her own time. It is unfair that her younger sibling goes to bed later. Maybe say she has to be in her room at 8 or 8:30. I disagree with the other answerers. 11 is waaaay to late!|`|i71z6JMNaa	honestly, going to bed that early isn't all that common. Most people don't need more than 9 hours of sleep a night, even if they are still growing. However, it depends upon when she wakes up. If she wakes up super early (like 5 am), then I guess it's reasonable.|`|SvICkL0xaa	she should have more rights and privileges than her younger sister. i think the younger daughter should have a bed time, but the older one shouldnt.|`|iDa8sEjEaa	The three year old I babysit goes to bed at 7.<br>  <br>  <br>  And I'm fourteen, don't have a bedtime, and know when I need to go to sleep which is usually between 10 and 11.<br>  <br>  <br>  Let her have a longer leash.|`|yiPZ1UZAaa	Bedtime? At 15? In America? That is a little extreme I think. High Schoolers should be in bed by 11pm on weekdays.|`|FiUprYsvaa	Her bedtime should be 10pm. <br>  She is 15 7pm as a bedtime is a joke and an insult.|`|P5Qr1HdNaa	omg....its impossible for me to sleep at 7 or 8 im 16 >< and no i dont thinnk its fair

This keeps them busy and they LOVE making things. <br>  You can also do simple games like bean bag toss. <br>  Good luck|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	a pony|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	how about one f those outdoor bounce houses? or just random children's games should work. or arts & crafts like finger painting or making t-shirts or whatever<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|nqR7CQ4gaa	Scavenger hunt?

gPg7qYGIaa	i looked it up on hns 24 and it gave me this page <a href="http://www.nhs24.com/content/default.asp?page=s5_4&articleID=1&sectionID=24" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhs24.com/content/default.asp...</a> <br>  <br>  this is the bit i think oyur after <br>  As well as being used for early abortion, the drugs, mifepristone and prostaglandin, can also be used for abortion later in pregnancy. However, the abortion will take longer, and more than one dose of prostaglandin may be needed. This type of abortion is similar to having a late natural miscarriage. Following the procedure, you may be able to return home the same day, but sometimes an overnight stay in hospital is required.|`|xyI7PRuhaa	I don't know about the UK, but in the US you need to get it directly from a dr/midwife/nurse practitioner.  It follows the same regulation as a surgical abortion in terms of age requirements and waiting periods etc.

For the first trimester and half of the second with this pregnancy it always felt as though i was about to start my period. It always had me really worried.    Turns out thoes cramps are normal, so long as you dont have any bleeding or spotting you and bub are fine.

Y te dir algo.    Un hombre puede hasta eyacular dentro de tu vagina y no quedar embarazada, siempre y cuando t NO ests en tus das frtiles.    Las mujeres no nos embarazamos en cualquier momento....... slo cuando estamos por ovular, es decir el da de ovulacin es cuando mayor posibilidad hay de quedar embarazada, y 3 das antes de ese dia o 2 das despus de esa fecha.    Si tu calculas bien tu dia de ovulacin, y en tus das frtiles EVITAS cualquier contacto sexual, podrs estar a salvo de embarazarte.    Para calcular el da de tu ovulacin y a partir de ahi tus das frtiles, si eres una mujer con periodos regulares..... lo que debes hacer es saber qu da esperas tu prxima menstruacin, y a partir de ese da contar 2 semanas hacia atrs...... y tendrs la fecha de ovulacin..... los 3 dias antes y los 2 dias despus, de esa fecha, se consideran los das frtiles......... si esos dias no tienes sexo..... no quedars embarazada.    En realidad, las mujeres que quedan embarazadas es por flojas....... porque no se ponen a calcular sus das frtiles y tienen sexo cuando les apetece sin tomar en cuenta estas precauciones.......... si evitaran el sexo en sus das frtiles y adems siempre usaran condn........ habra menos embarazos no planeados y tambin se evitaran el hecho de tomar medicamentos (anticonceptivos)    Es cosa de ser consciente de tu naturaleza, ser inteligente, y cuidadosa, y todo se puede hacer tomando en cuenta estos detalles.

Yo tuve a mi primer hijo bastante joven y fui la primera de mis amigas en casarse y tener hijos, as que me sent medio perdida al principio, mi mama que era enfermera, me dio el mejor consejo "reljate, infrmate y disfrtalo".  Como mi mama estaba lejos, para aconsejarme todo el tiempo, me compre un par de buenos libros, escgete uno de una editorial respetable, preferentemente hecho por un par de doctores, un gineco-obstetra y un pediatra, y que tenga ilustraciones.  Al principio va a ser normal que ests nerviosa, ser madre es algo grande, pero entre mejor preparada ests, y mayor informacin tengas, mas relajada vas a estar durante tu embarazo y durante tu parto. Haz caso omiso a los "chisme de viejas", mi regla de oro, que adquir durante mi primer embarazo "si esta persona no es ms educada que yo, no es nadie para aconsejarme".  Te aconsejo que escojas un gineclogo con quien te sientas cmoda, si por cualquier cosa, no te agrada quien te vea ahora, creme no va a ser la persona con quien quieras estar a la hora del parto, si tu situacin econmica y tus servicios mdicos te lo permiten, busca el gineclogo con quien te sientas a gusto a la hora de tus consultas, que responda a tus preguntas y que te de la informacin que necesitas. No le dejes todo el trabajo a tu doctor, haz tu tarea y preprate.   Mantente en forma, vas a ocupar toda tu energa a la hora del parto, y cuando el beb llegue,reljate e involucra a tu pareja, esta puede y debe de ser una experiencia nutriva y especial para los dos.  Por ultimo, disfruta tu embarazo y FELICIDADES!  |`|a1b114111516d306c7c7694531068b63aa	Lo primero prepara tu cuerpo, desintoxcate, si lo hacen ambos mejor, no en vano los Griegos llamaban LUNA DE MIEL  al perodo previo a concebir, el hecho de querer prepararte significa que tu mente y espritu ya lo estn.

La ovulacion se da 14 dias antes de la fecha en la que te debe venir de nuevo el periodo, osea 2 semanas antes de tu regla! es totalmente normal que ovules alrededor del dia 20, de hecho a mi me pasaba asi, lo que sucede es que nuestros ciclos son mas largos... eso de ovular el dia 14 solo le sucede a las mujeres con ciclos regulares de 28 dias! asi que estas bien... si hoy subio tu temp, eso quiere decir que ya el ovulo fue liberado por el ovario! suerte y chequea estos links que te pueden ayudar!|`|Of3JwSwpaa	aaa? stee oyeee see un pokiitoo maas breveee...iioo noo tee entendii naadaaa abreviiaaa. |`|id7lQ4qMaa	SI mija trata de ser mas explisita,,para q podamos entender |`|WrOBBWP2aa	Hola mi vida!  Normalmente a la mujeres que en un a?o no consiguen quedarse embarazadas les empiezan a mirar para saber si hay algn problema. Mi consejo es que vayas al mdico y le explicas que llevas todo este tiempo mirando de quedar en estado.   La temperatura sube normalmente medio grado cuando ovulas. Pero ano tienes que obsesionarte. Es posible que no sea tu problema y sea el de tu marido.  Pero sobretodo pide hora a tu medico y comentale todo lo que nos cuentas. Ve con tu marido tambin.  Suerte!|`|4y0vyyRBaa	Precisamente por eso el metodo del ritmo no es cin por cineto seguro porque cada mujer es diferente tengo una tia que solo es fertil un enero de cada dos a?os es decir un enero si y un enero no y solo eneros!!!! aun con eso tiene tres hijos y decidio operarse por si se le olvida!!! Conozco otra persona que solo es fertil en diciembre no se exactamente a que se deba pero asi es y tambien se de persoans que hasta en su ciclo se han embarazado o sea que son fertiles al 100 % todo el periodo!!! TRanquila no te presiones demasiado ya llegara en su moemtno justo!!!|`|dtoeqgtUaa	lo que tienes es un problema de fertilidad para lo cual te debes ometer a un tratamiento|`|QSLyMI5gaa	Lo que nos cuentas confirma que cada organismo es diferente y que no somos maquinas de precision, aunque si maravillosas. Es decir no todas ovulamos X dia del ciclo, ni todos los ciclos duran la misma cantidad d dias.    Yo te sugiero que le plantees a tu medico iniciar un tratamiento d fertilidad.    Si el medico ya determino q ni tu ni tu pareja tienen problemas, tal vez es que te has equivocado al determinar cuales son tus dias fertiles, dices q los consultas x internet, y ahora q te tomas la temperatura resulta q son despues d los q marca el calendario q checas en linea    Yo q tu pruebo tanto en los dias del calendario fertil online como los dias en q sube la temperatura, conozco una pareja a la q solo le pego el chicle (jajaja) hasta q optaron x dejar de hacerlo ciertos dias. (mi comadrita dice q lo hacian casi a diario, pero generalmente un dia si y un dia no, jejeje) Y asi a los 3 meses lograron bb    en mi caso procuraba al menos hacerlo cada 2 o 3 dias, pero sobre todo disfrutar a mi pareja, xq luego dicen q si te obsesionas con la busqueda menos lo logras!    Ojala q logres bb muy pronto!|`|GfoEitzGaa	mira te ayudaria si supiera sobre ese tema pero lamento mucho no saber pero espero que si es un problema que se solucione lo mas pronto posible|`|Jda1ixEHaa	PON LAS PIERNAS HACIA ARRIBA!!!

Esta prctica de sacar el pene de la vagina justo antes de la eyaculacin se consider como un mtodo anticonceptivo natural durante mucho tiempo, pero no es una manera segura de evitar el embarazo ya que el lquido preseminal la secrecin previa a la eyaculacin tambin contiene semen. No protege a los integrantes de la pareja de las ETS (como sida o sfilis)|`|wukGsVXLaa	El coito interrumpido, coitus interruptus, mtodo del retiro, mtodo de retirada, eyacular afuera o marcha atrs, son algunos de los nombres que recibe este antiguo mtodo anticonceptivo, consistente en retirar el pene de la vagina en el momento de eyacular.  Esta tcnica de interrumpir el coito, por desconocimiento o falta de informacin, es recomendada a adolescentes como un mtodo natural y absolutamente seguro de evitar el embarazo.    Para ser mas clara y q me entiendas,significa q el hombre la saca justamente antes de eyacular, pero e d decirt q como metodo anticonceptivo no es bueno ya q antes de la eyaculacion final puede salir likido preseminal  espero ayudarte, un beso,bye|`|Wz72eyU4aa	pues te lo sacan antes de terminar y ya |`|TzyvNlzzaa	es cuando el en vez de venir dentro de ti, lo saka para ke no lo haga y asi eviten un embarazo claro ke esto ocurre cuando no usan proteccion ... aun ke tmb ocurre cuando alguien los interrumpe =S|`|4HRjoudpaa	cuando tu padre llega a casa por una olla de los frijoles|`|ECE8mSkqaa	cuando no terminas el acto sexual con tu pareja por allguna |`|N9aHZtpgaa	El mtodo por retiro requiere que el varn retire su pene de la vagina antes de que l tenga el orgasmo. De esta manera, los espermatozoides no llegan a la vagina y no hay probabilidades de que algn espermatozoide se junte con un vulo y que produzca la fertilizacin.

8Nqq7tkwaa	i'm a native american mother and i want to share with you my experiences around halloween.    when my children were younger, they would hate halloween because there would always be a classmate or 2 dressed like an indian. one time my daughter came home crying because one such boy in her class told her indians were wild and he then he ran around the playground slapping his mouth and "whooping" as well as talked in broken english (think old westerns).    our children have to deal with this not only around halloween but the whole month of november when suddenly there are stereotypical indians everywhere. they feel mocked and belittled and it hurts. much the same way i am sure black children would feel if someone dressed in blackface and acted like a minstrel show.    from one parent to another, please don't dress your child up as an indian. it should be a fun time for all kids. |`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	No, it is offensive to Native Americans.  Plus, if he lived anywhere near me (upper midwest) he'd freeze to death!  Around here all costumes must be purchased a size larger then normally needed so that coats or sweatshirts can be worn underneath of them.|`|a8IRxC4raa	There's no law against it, but it's pretty offensive, to be honest.  It mocks ideas sacred to Native Peoples.    all the best.|`|sSlxwrSLaa	Yes, but my mother shouldn't.|`|nNez1t56aa	As long as he doesn't reveal anything that might set the neighbours off, and it isn't a cold night, sure. Nothing wrong with being original on halloween. I'm going as a cullen :)|`|Jd8lkPBjaa	I think native Americans would find it offensive....is he going to war?  If he were going trick-or-treating on the south side of Chicago or South Central LA then is would be ok.|`|20117c2d24d216a72c5b973e9d412b2caa	I guess that would depend on where you live, like if you live in Florida, sure, why not, it will be eighty degrees on Halloween. Now, if you live anywhere near me (Pennsylvania), you may want to buy the boy some tan sweats and toss on some thermal underwear for good measure because it's not supposed to leave the fifties that day.|`|O21jt4PYaa	I think he should definitely be covered, especially b/c it gets cold sometimes (depending where you live).    I would suggest wearing a longer loincloth, kind of like a torn cloth that fits like a mini-skirt (don't say mini-skirt to him), then he can wear biker-shorts underneath (you can even push the biker-shorts up a bit). As far as the upper body, I suggest making some sort of animal fur piece he can drape over his shoulders (maybe even tie it over one shoulder and under the other; across the body). Fake animal fur material can be bought by the yard at any fabric store (maybe even wal-mart) and cut it in a animal skin type shape; if you really want to get creative sew the sides in a bit.    And then do the creative body paint in cool areas and designs, feathers are definitely a good idea. You could make a head band or if your kid has enough hair, tie them into the hair so that they dangle (that is something I've seen Native Americans do)    Good-luck and have fun! |`|AjqO1aJgaa	I don't know where you live, but round here he'd freeze to death!|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	Depends on the weather. I probably wouldn't allow it though.|`|oxIulcDpaa	If the question is about being politically correct, then the answer is yeah he should be able to do that.  He's not doing it to make fun of any group of people and many Native Americans would see this as an homage to their heritage (I think).    Mohawk  You are stupid.  I'm Asian and if someone dressed as a former Asian slave that layed railroad, I wouldn't be offended.  I listen to dumb white people say things about Asians eating dog and it doesn't bother me.  You just have to explain that those are the stereotypes and preconceived notions of ignorant people.
