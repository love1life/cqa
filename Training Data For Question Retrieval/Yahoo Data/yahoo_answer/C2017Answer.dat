AA10179458	I don't think so. Usually only modified systems are susceptible to banning on Live. I don't know of any way for Live to check your controller. Microsoft allows companies to make after market controllers but not after market systems. You should be fine.|`|zYVJrPtjaa	No I  doubted it unless MS is smart enough to run a system check on their controllers which I ve heard they can but the only you can get banned is by Ms fining out you modded your Xbox <br>  you might get suspended from Curseing at player and who on earth is stupid enough to say you have a modded Xbox 360 and a Modded Controller? keep that **** to your self because somone people are rats and they will report you for that for being jealous|`|ApZ0qS88aa	You can have your account banned for using a modded controller as it violates the EULA.|`|PuBuDXrCaa	I'd have to say no because I hear that many people use modded controllers in Call of Duty 4 and they haven't gotten in trouble so I'm assuming you can't get caught.

Tkb1TKwZaa	I had the same problem.<br>  <br>  Prepaid accounts have special prepaid numbers...you can't use the numbers on a non-prepaid account (which your mom's contract account is)  It kinda stinks.  Sorry!<br>  <br>  Contract accounts are better than prepaid though (if you're doing a decent amount of talking/texting), so it's still worth it, even if it's a bit of a hassle to tell all your friends your new cellphone number.|`|MeeJWmGtaa	Yes, but all the normal credit check etc procedures will still apply.<br>  <br>  Call 611 from your handset (free of charge) and ask for advice.|`|WfC3sDTHaa	no, you cannot make your pre-paid account an additional line to a contract plan.

Xxviy63Paa	It sounds like your ps2 may be headed for the disc-read-error stacks, but there's a couple of things you can try yet.<br>  <br>  First clean the lens. Open the case and using a cotton swab and propanol, gently rub the lens in a spiral then let it dry. Don't touch the capacitor near the power input, it will give you a shock. Maybe even kill you, who knows.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, try readjusting the lens height. How to do that is complicated and depends on model. Go to the site below for instructions.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, you can try adjusting the pots before giving up. This is a last resort because it will make your ps2 wear out much faster. The pots are little screws on the laser assembly that adjust the resistance, and thus the voltage the lasers get. First try lowering the resistance, in small increments, then try raising it. Don't guess; use a multimeter to turn them to the ideal level. Again the site below has specifics.<br>  <br>  You could replace the laser assembly. They are about $70 for an old, fat ps2, and maybe $20 to $40 for a model for a slim ps2. That is why there are stacks and stacks of ps2's marked "DRE" in the world. Too expensive to fix them. There's no use buying a used laser assembly because chances are it's about to die.<br>  <br>  site: <br>  <a href="http://www.cyber-mag.com/station" rel="nofollow">http://www.cyber-mag.com/station</a><br>  <br>  you may have to browse around a bit. It's Australian, run by modders which is legal there, so it's a big industry.|`|UzV0jc2haa	I would buy a new one.|`|47ddda29b6896ce72acab50c6bef43fdaa	It's time for a new one.

Sorry|`|47ddda29b6896ce72acab50c6bef43fdaa	Memory card is worn out. You'll have to start all over more than likely. Put in another memory card with the memory card in question in the slot and open the disc tray and go to the browser, and see if the PS2 detects both memory cards. If it does, transfer all files to the new memory card.
4Pk6VNftaa	Well, I suppose it COULD be possible to write a virus for the Wii.  After all the Wii is just a computer - and it doesn't matter if it doesn't have a hard drive, or this, or that.  A computer is a computer.  Heck, you could theoretically write a virus for the computer that controls the engine in your car if you really really wanted to.<br>  <br>  However, the Wii is designed to only run software that is from Nintendo.  Nintendo is not in the business of writing viruses.<br>  <br>  As for websites that may try to do nasty things to a (Windows) PC, those things won't work on the Wii because the code isn't compatible with the Wii's operating system or web browser and even if it was, if it's not from Nintendo, the Wii won't execute it.<br>  <br>  Webpages, text, images, videos, etc. cannot contain viruses.  Web applications - like Yahoo Mail - are actually run on the remote server, not your local PC or Wii.<br>  <br>  Yes, there are exceptions, like MS Word file macro "viruses", but these are due to bad programming practices on behalf of the Microsoft Corporation.  Your Wii doesn't run MS Word or Windows, so even if you told your Wii to display an infected file, the virus part would just be ignored.|`|AA10652986	It can't store anything and nothing is downloadable, so a virus is impossible since ,unlike PCs, nothing can be stored which is needed for a virus to take effect. Even if you tried to download a virus on purpose, it wouldn't work.|`|EpvHhbByaa	Give up hope, it's like trying to explain to a brick wall that a Mac can't run .exes|`|RkjOxucAaa	isn't that a good thing|`|hE4CXKX2aa	Well, the only real reason why Mac's, Wii and such don't get viruses is that those people who make them know you guys are already suffering enough from using such defaulted equipment  Really, it is that sad that you even can't get negative attention.|`|cby75xL4aa	Wow I feel your pain.<br>  <br>  I'm assuming that he's not letting you connect to the internet...<br>  <br>  How about the fact that there has been no Wii in the world to ever get a virus?<br>  <br>  Actually, better idea, how about sending an email to Nintendo, so they can explain it to your dad?|`|RHeuCvi9aa	it just like a mac bro it's CAN'T get viruses|`|tzFkYLGqaa	Just be happy it doesnt get viruses.|`|5HfuI3MEaa	no wii ever got a virus from two years of 827 million people playing the wii online...

KiVENZoBaa	All you gotta do is play a lot. Its like trying to play Guitar on Expert mode. You think that it may be too hard and complicated to play on expert mode, but once you play so many times a day, you become better. Its like practicing but having fun with it, instead of stressing out on how bad or that you can't play at a certain level. My suggestion, play a lot everyday with a set list of 6 of your favorite songs, or more, and play them continuously. I'd say if you play countless hours for about 2-3 months, you can become an expert drummer.|`|g95VVtEhaa	I would recommend going into practice mode...there you can slow the speed of the song and practice the hard parts.

AZNOC6OUaa	Most podcasts are free.<br>  <br>  Podcasting is online audio content that is delivered via an RSS feed. Many people liken podcasting to radio on demand. However, in reality, podcasting gives far more options in terms of content and programming than radio does. In addition, with Podcasting, listeners can determine the time and the place, meaning they decide what programming they want to receive and when they want to listen to it. <br>  <br>  Listeners can retain audio archives to listen to at their leisure. While blogs have turned many bloggers into journalists, podcasting has the potential to turn podcasters into radio personalities. <br>  <br>  What is Podcasting - <br>  <a href="http://www.podcasting-tools.com/what-is-podcasting.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.podcasting-tools.com/what-is-...</a>|`|eid6iT4Raa	no its free and a podcast can be either a video or just audio.

I agree that demo wasn't that good, but after playing the campaign, I found that the game actually picks up pace after the initial part, so don't take the demo as reference and rate the game(if you loved the demo, you'll go crazy playing the game). I would even go further and say that it's the best shooter I have played in a long long time (beats Gears and COD4 in my opinion). <br>  <br>  I also agree with you about the controls. People keep on complaining that they aren't COD type. I mean play COD4/5 if you want that kind off controls. Don't type **** cause you are so retarded that you cannot adapt to the new controls. Also, for trolls like them, try Alternate 2 controls+70-80% sensitivity. It gives you COD like controls.<br>  <br>  KZ2 is probably the best FPS I have played on a console. It has phenomenal graphics (the environment is totally destructible+2 GB textures per level is insanity). It doesn't give anything innovative to the genre apart from the cover system, but it does the basics better than any other game has done and that puts KZ2 right in the top seat.|`|VcNHahtgaa	I'm really excited...<br>  <br>  I'm going to sleep early today, put alarm at 11:30 and go to Gamestop to pick up the game :D.

I want to skip it, pretend I'm sick but I need to cheat off people for tests.|`|mb3ooc3uaa	Even if you change the controller to feel like CoD, it won't play like CoD.

AA11877492	Viewsonic TVs are third tier junk assembled from god-only-knows what kind of cheap Chinese parts - you'll never be able to get parts or service for it.

QRGLuQ8xaa	in your iTunes library, under "devices", your ipod should apear. Click it.  Make sure the "manage my own music" box is UNCHECKED.  Then go to your iTunes library (not under "devices"). Once in your iTunes library, select "Edit" at the top, and then click "select all".  Drag all the blue files to your ipod under "devices".  This is the manual way. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|8OVpCBg4aa	Go to your taskbar at the bottom of your computer screen and exit out of limewire it will be the logo and then right click and press exit|`|HSvgSBjuaa	go down to your ipod section where it says (your name)'s ipod and then look at the bottom of the screen where it says how full ur ipod is. If its all full and doesnt have any gray part left then you have added too many songs onto your ipod and it cant hold that many so delete the ones you barely listen to. If it doesn't say " do not disconnect" then disconnect it and try again, if it does say that synching is doen then still disconnect when it says "do not disconnect" it wont do anything but not add the songs and just try again<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! =)<br>  I have disconnected my ipod many times when it says "do not disconnect" but i had to because i had this other problem.
QLSx3kkBaa	Technically it is illegal because you are breaking your contract with Apple. But I just jailbroke my iPod Touch about three weeks ago on 2.1 and it was super easy!!! It only took me 6 minutes. But be warned do not try to upgrade your iPod touch while it's jailbroken. It will screw it up! If you want to upgrade you will have to restore it in iTunes and then upgrade and then re-jailbreak it and then, re-install any cracked apps that you had, which is kind of a pain but it's easy. But it's totally worth it. I got some games that I really wanted but where way to much money. And it's super easy to get cracked apps. As for disadvantages there really is none because if something goes wrong you can just restore it in iTunes. The only difference that I have noticed in my iPod is that the battery life seems to be a good bit shorter, But just turn off Wi-Fi when you are not using it, That helps a lot!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I Helped!|`|PP8tKxYdaa	if you have the ipod touch update i recomend you dont jailbreak it becsuse its just spupid theres apps for all the stuff on a jail broken ipod|`|dKMVChjQaa	you can download the jailbreak for it here.<br>  <a href="http://redsn0w.com/" rel="nofollow">http://redsn0w.com/</a><br>  there are also instructions on the readme.<br>  if you don't like the jailbreak you can always reset it to factory<br>  defaults.

p11sk9qhaa	It doesn't have a cool apps store like the iPhone. You're limited to Java applications and what's available through the AT&T application store. Just go into a AT&T store, let them know you're thinking about buying one and usually they'll bring one out for you to play with.  It is a pretty decent phone though.

sMNEooBVaa	The Pearl by far. The Gravity is made cheap, so the quality is cheap. The Pearl is a nice phone, very solid (in my opinion). I had a pearl for 2 years before my current phone, loved it.

sMNEooBVaa	You would have to pay a data plan per iPhone, so $20 per iPhone.|`|4cMuedpWaa	The 3G iPhone data plan is $30 with AT&T so you should see an increase of $10 on your AT&T bill.<br>  <br>  My iPhone bill is around $ 100 which includes the minimum voice plan and the $30 iPhone data plan.<br>  <br>  So, either you're being billed lots of overcharges, either AT&T is screwing you up and it wouldn't be anything new as I have had to deal with nonsense overcharges from AT&T from time to time.<br>  <br>  You better check your bill and find the inconsistencies and fix the with AT&T Customer Support.
sMNEooBVaa	There are pictures you can look up for the new sidekick (search sidekick lx 09'). And as far as anyone knows, there is no touchscreen (disappointing), but the rest of the specs are considerably due for the sidekick. Between the two, I would say the voyager just because of the touchscreen. With the sidekick you need to flip it open to dial (i hate it), if it had a touchscreen it would be awesome.
xwEPYEqSaa	Fallout 3 if you need a game to eat up a lot of time.<br>  <br>  Street Fighter if you play with friends a lot.<br>  <br>  Killzone if you love online play and badass FPS<br>  <br>  Resistance 2 if FPS and the best online play on PS3.<br>  <br>  So I think the best choice if you wont be getting another game for a while would be Fallout if you plan to get another game in a month or so go with Killzone.<br>  <br>  Get the games in this order:<br>  Killzone<br>  Fallout 3<br>  Resistance 2<br>  Street Fighter|`|Mboh3eVCaa	Out of that list I'd go with Fallout 3 or Killzone 2.  I haven't played Killzone, but I've heard from friends that it's good.  I've played Fallout, and it's pretty amazing.  It's a long game, and with all the side quests you can add a lot of time.  <br>  <br>  I'd also recommend Left4Dead if you haven't played it yet, as it meets all three of the requirements you mentioned..  I've probably put at least 60 hours into it and I'll probably have at least another 30 into it by the time I get expert mode completely done.  It's the best co-op games I've ever played.  The competitive mode isn't all that great, but the co-op story mode completely makes up for that.  And the game has a dynamic level director that basically change the positions of enemies and weapons in every time you play; never the same experience twice.|`|cOQCC93maa	they are all REALLY good games. So I'm just gonna tell you what I think and hopefully it will help ya out. I would have to say Its between Fallout 3 and Killzone 2. Resistance 2 was a pretty good game too but I would think the other two (Killzone 2 and Fallout 3) would be the runner ups. They both have great replay value and well.....practically everything is great about them both, from the story line to online to great replay value. I can't really tell you which of the two to get, since their both really good games. But I hope from what I just said, it might give you a good idea of what to do. Now its up to you to figure out which of them you think your most interested in (since of course I can't tell you what your interest would be).<br>  <br>  I hoped I helped in any way at all, and HAPPY gaming:D|`|B5DLEEPQaa	I'd say Killzone 2<br>  <br>  Fallout 3 is good but once you stop playing, it'll be kind of hard to get back into<br>  <br>  Street Fighter IV is fun but I got bored with it (that's just me. It's still an excellent game though)<br>  <br>  Resistance 2 is EXCELLENT and so is the online but it gets old after you beat it<br>  <br>  GET KILLZONE 2!!!<br>  <br>  add me on psn:illydoo<br>  <br>  I'm getting killzone 2 tomorrow|`|oiHQ0kCkaa	I would say<br>  <br>  Call of Duty 5 - Amazing game.<br>  Killzone 2 - More amazing game lmao.<br>  Resistance 2 - Extremely fun!<br>  LittleBigPlanet - Fun for when your bored.<br>  NHL 09 - Great fun if your into hockey|`|oYG01E2daa	I would say call of duty world at war is a really fun game, also the one before it call of duty 4 modern warefare.|`|I532I4o5aa	kill zone 2!<br>  my second choice would be fallout 3<br>  you tube the game play and you choose!<br>  kill zone 2 it programmed better my opinion though lol|`|pOi0wewIaa	Resistance 2|`|SVCyDW04aa	nonono get little big planet man get past all the kiddyish stuff and its a perfect game|`|hyo4tWv9aa	well seriously i dont know why street fighter is on there. but in the end its ur choice. if i was u i would go 4 killzone2 because it supports awesome online gameplay. and its new which the best graphics out there|`|pl2SocVKaa	ok well falout 3 is basically just one playthrough and you done but its a 75 hour game so if you want something long get it and street fighter 4 never ends since it has trophies plus online and so does killzone 2 and resistance 2 but the best for what you want is probably killzone 2|`|jxpV13rTaa	fallout 3 is fantastic. you cant go wrong. it litterally has hundreds of hours of gameplay and that again in replay value. it is HUGE and even when your done the main missions there are side missions. and when your done those there is so much to explore. street fighter is bad in comparison to the other games you listed. i have yet to try resistance 2 but i have heard great things. tomorrow is the release date for killzone 2 and i cant wait. most anticipated game of the year. it will have the best graphics of any game on any console. that games gonna be revolutionary. plus it has online which is great for the replay value|`|QIlhmWwBaa	if you are into multiplayer then killzone 2 but if you don't care about that too much then fallout 3<br>  on my opinion <br>  Killzone 2<br>  Fallout 3<br>  Street Fighter IV<br>  Resistance 2 is crap and not worth it so just wait for something else like god of war 3|`|VcNHahtgaa	Killzone 2 for sure.<br>  <br>  You will most likely play campaign at least 2 times, which is an easy ~15 hours of gameplay for you.

2Ge4zC10aa	If it's been two months, and you still haven't gotten unbanned, it's not temporary. There's not a way to get unbanned, Microsoft has to do it themselves. If you have been banned from MIC privileges, then people have been filing complaints, and putting negative player reviews in about you (or in this case, your brothers) misusing your mic (i.e. making noise, disruptive voice, playing music, being loud, inappropriate language, etc.) there really is no way to un-ban this yourself; Microsoft has to do it. If this continues, just make a new account and cancel your membership. Sorry, dude.|`|VcubhWv9aa	Its called a mic, And its probably a temporary ban, so just wait.|`|8146e347ad7537c819ea87c18358a194aa	just call xbox 1-800-4my-xbox it will save you a ton of time|`|lADx09Uhaa	wow make a new account|`|66ced41d0362436f7b2208da0b10870daa	Wow, they must have done something horrible to get you banned lol, geez

cMdudv6aaa	Actually Nikon doesn't suck, Nikon and Canon all have their pros and cons. It's also how you use your equipment. It's like comparing a AK to a M16 but in a different sense, cons and pros. There's isn't one that is completely better than the other. Well depend on what your use is...<br>  <br>  <br>  My suggestion is buy a range of lenses in between what you need without going near what you don't need. That way you know exactly what you need, and no it's not wasting money, it's advancing further in having more equipment for different situations.|`|xG5ZlJDqaa	Hey, im offended by your comment on Nikon. Nikon and Canon are equally great. What Nikon loses out in resolution is quickly made up for in high-iso performance and better ergonomics. Both make excellent glass, Canon has more in current production, but Nikon has a gazillion lenses circulating around Adorama used. The old 85mm f/1.4 AI-s is has been in production for 10 years after the autofocus version was introduced. It's discontinued now, but it still much coveted among Nikon users.<br>  <br>  To answers your question, try looking at 3rd party lens makers. Sigma makes an excellent 70mm f/2.8 macro lens. Here is a review of the lens: <a href="http://www.slrgear.com/reviews/showproduct.php/product/964/cat/30" rel="nofollow">http://www.slrgear.com/reviews/showprodu...</a>|`|IY9JolQ4aa	Switch to Nikon. i have no idea why anyone is sticking with Canon.

jExpA0Qlaa	If you're using the Microsoft wireless adapter then I would check to make sure that your modem is also capable of being a router and that it has a large enough MTU capability. You could also try entering the settings manually. First find out your IP, DNS, and gateway settings by using the computer to which your router is hooked up. Then take those codes and imput them under the Networks Settings section of the xbox settings. If this doesn;t work call microsoft at 1-800-4-MY-XBOX and they can help you from there.|`|LI7epJi9aa	well, if you dont have the wireless adaptor from microsoft made for xbox 360 then it probly wont work. otherwise try going into your network settings and changing the network to a public network. it should work then but you should turn the modem and xbox off after changing the settings and then turn them back on like a minute later and it should work

2Ge4zC10aa	Due to the Title Update that was released for Halo 3 last year, the global ranks (that ranked up based on your highest skill) have been done away with (this due to the rumor that someone hacked into Bungie's server and changed all his friend's ranks to generals). This means that you now have a different rank in each category. You can still rank your global rank up that you had before the update.<br>  <br>  But...<br>  <br>  I've found that if you finish in at least 4th or above in Lone Wolves, you usually will go up with your skill point (your 20; that's not a rank, that's your "TrueSkill" skill point in that Playlist), and I'm pretty sure that only the top 2 or end up gaining any EXP points for that category.<br>  <br>  Lone Wolves, if you have the ability to finish in the top 4, can rank you up very fast with the highest skill thing. That's how I got up.|`|0F3MreEaaa	i like blueberry pie|`|66ced41d0362436f7b2208da0b10870daa	Make sure you are playing ranked.<br>  <br>  Also, are you finishing in the top 3?

I've never heard of Clearwire. If it isn't compatible, then it isn't compatible. There isn't really anything you can do. I would double check to make sure everything is ok. If its the network, then maybe you should set up a new one.
b6QazRVwaa	Best buy if you have a receipt.
xG5ZlJDqaa	You didn't say what kind of nature you are shooting. If landscape is your thing, get the Panasonic LX3. It's image quality is stunning for a compact camera, and exceeds the output of even those from a Canon G10 at higher iso settings. Its lens goes wider than most other compacts too, at 24mm, as opposed to 28mm and 36mm. If you like shooting distant objects or wildlife, a superzoom camera should be your best bet. Canon SX and Panasonic FZ series both make excellent "superzooms".
inZ9CWBiaa	My sister and brother in law and their two kids (5 and 7) got one for Christmas. They love it, My 5 year old nephew would bowl for hours. He is too little for most of the other games other than Wii Sport, but as he has limited screen time especially through the week this doesn't seem to be a real issue. If he gets 30 minutes of screen time, he will always choose Wii, my niece will often choose her DS, internet time or TV over the Wii. Her favourite thing to do is create Miis!<br>  It is true that there aren't a ton of games for 5 year olds, but they grow up! I love that at least with the Wii they aren't sitting on the couch!|`|AA11481224	get him a nintendo ds he will play with it more<br>  <br>  there arent any games for the wii for a 5 year old<br>  <br>  but on the ds theres a crayola game<br>  one called little boys game room my 6 year old loves it<br>  plus wonder pets dora diego and sponge bob|`|5HfuI3MEaa	he is too young|`|hwaTOBL7aa	My friend has a 4 year old brother and he actually beat me in Mario Kart Wii and i was trying my hardest and I'm 14 (yeah I know it embarrassing)!

Not to mention the games, I think you're looking at about $450 to $500.  <br>  That's just my estimation because those are still good games.  <br>  Another think is, don't sell it to EB games or any other store.  Do it trough craig's list or some private means.  The stores will give you pennies and sell them for twice as much.
1zOnl05taa	It could just be heat, but my thoughts are it's the laser. If you can get it to a mom and pop shop or somewhere that can take a look and get you a second opinion I'd do it right away before you're facing the Red Ring. Or you can just give in a buy a PS3 and be happy like I did. ^_^|`|KMWjhENqaa	I'm gonna agree with T Smith. The heat is probably causing the discoloration. I would call microsoft and ask them about it before anything else happens. It may be an easy fix or it may take awhile. I don't really know. If it is under warranty and your xbox needs to be replaced, then you could just do that. It is sort of strange that both are doing the same thing. Are the conditions they're in alike? Did you get them around the same time or were they made around the same time because it could be a manufacturing mistake and the laser could be messed up.|`|66ced41d0362436f7b2208da0b10870daa	I agree with T.Smith, it's gotta be the heat.

If there is an emergency, the police and fire departments can track down the location of a landline, but they can't do that with a cell phone. So in that case you'd have to specify verbally where you are (probably the street address or the intersection).|`|rZyTDm9Waa	Yes.. Even I did and works out well.

With Sky+ you can pause, rewind live tv, you can record programs onto the 160gb hard drive and watch then any time you want. One cool feature is the ability to series link all the programs so that the box automatically records all the programs in the series when they come on.<br>  Another cool feature is the anytime function, this allows a limited number of programs to be watched any time you want.<br>  2) Two signals are decoded by the box allowing a full HD picture.<br>  3) There are only two down sides to it, first its not possible to record HD movies that have been recorded to the hard drive to a DVD.

930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	yeah it will work. There won't be any other fees. If you want that new phone on record, you call them with the IMEI number, again, no fee for that. Nothing on your contract will change, or your plan. <br>  The only thing that changes the contract is a new phone, through them, at a discounted price. If you buy your own phone, and don't get anything from at&t for it, they can't do a thing to your plan or fees, or contract. Your all good.

tHjBr4L4aa	T-Rabbit is on the right track for you.  A dslr like a Nikon D40 or the Canon XS doesn't have the inherent shutterlag that almost all compact digital cameras have.  The compact cameras will snap the picture seconds after you press the button.  This almost guarantees that you'll miss "the moment" and capture "the moment after".<br>  <br>  As a school teacher, parent, and sportsphotographer, I only use my pocket compact digital to snap non-moving subjects. For the realities of school, children, and sports, I NEED a dslr.  <br>  <br>  Also, a dslr will have a larger sensor and more manual settings, allowing you to capture detailed images of your angel sleeping, and letting you take those pictures without the intrusion of a flash.  Whether you're capturing first steps, the thrill of learning to riding a bike, dance recitals, or a school performance, you won't be sorry that you got a dslr.<br>  <br>  Here's a professional who swears by his D40.<br>  <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d40.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d40.htm</a><br>  <br>  And here's some "baby" photos I found on Flickr taken with a D40.<br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?s=int&z=t&cm=nikon%2Fd40&q=baby&m=tags" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/search/?s=int&z=t&...</a>|`|A07TqVdiaa	nikon d40 = perfect baby pictures =]]]|`|82945a2e144529959bcaf552b16f7de9aa	The disposable does not auto focus.<br>  On the digital when you hit the shutter button the camera goes into auto focus mode before the picture is taken and by then the scene has changed. Try this. Touch the shutter lightly to prefocus, wait until your daughter pauses and then push the shutter all the way down.

Actually, it may be a bit of overkill for your house.<br>  <br>  I don't believe that cable systems are using anything over about 1.2 GHz.

X5quBhTHaa	Nope, it's really as simple as that. MP3 is a form of compressing recorded music. Midi is a sequence of electronic impulses used to control prerecorded sounds on a device or piece of software that supports it.

rvMxaNAraa	I don't think they take requests for movies or at least not from one person or a small number of people. Part of the process of getting the movie on itunes is acquiring the rights to sell it. itunes can't just get a movie and start selling it, that is illegal! It is possible that itunes has looked into that particular movie but perhaps the company that holds the rights wont agree to itunes selling it. Also, itunes isn't going to get a movie if there isn't a big enough demand for it. One person isn't enough.

If your TV is only 720p, there will be no difference.  720p is 720p, no matter what connector you are using.<br>  <br>  Digital signals require less shielding over long distances, so there's less of a chance of interference on 1080p and higher signals with a long (>25 ft) cable, meaning digital cables should be cheaper in the long run.  For the xbox 360 with standard cables it will make NO difference what type of cable you are using.  Some people also like it better because you only need to use one plug for video and sound instead of 5, but that's just personal preference.<br>  <br>  I think the previous posters are comparing RCA cables with an SD picture to an HD picture.|`|dJSUl7Q0aa	HDMI does make a much better video quality, but you really shouldn't notice too much with your TV screen size. if you had a 1080I or 1080P TV then i would suggest that you get the HDMI cable, but you should be jut fine with a component video cable on a 32". i have a 52" 1080I plasma TV, and i connect my 720P HD cameras to it, really i don't notice that much of a difference. bottom line, i say you save your money. well, hope that helps!|`|8b9QZLp3aa	I would say with a 720p it wouldn't be really that noticeable if at all but if you do decide to buy an HDMI cable for the conveniance, don't spend the $40-$70 that they cost at retail stores.

NKD17jLAaa	Any TV will work just fine with your Comcast cable, but the best TV is a Plasma TV. Display quality for digital TV has little to do with the delivery mechanism. Truth be told, actually a cheap antenna will offer a slightly better picture than will cable or sattelite due to the uncompressed signal provided via the antenna. <br>  <br>  Whatever the source, the reason a Plasma TV is better has to do with how it creates light, color and handles motion. Plasma TV create light to form a picture. The Plasma TV's inherent ability to produce "zero" light means they can produce black's that an LCD can never accomplish.  the superior contrast ratio that a plasma TV can produce in a single TV frame also enables them to produce more vibrant color.<br>  <br>  Plasma TV's also handle motion much better than can an LCD. It takes mere mictroseconds to swithc on a Plasma pixel. An LCD on the othe hand takes 10's of milliseconds to "open" or "close", much like a venitien blind does. This time delay (more than 1000 time sslower) is what leads LCD TV's to dislay blurs when motion occurs ona the screen.  Academic research in Japan shows that typical LCD TV's (1080p native resolution) can only display 300 lines of actual resolution wat 18 pixels/frame motions speed (about what you'd see when watching a football game).  Plasma TV's howver retain nearly 900 lines of resolution at 18 pixels/frame. Indeed a 720p Plasma TV achieves 600 lines of resolution at 18 pixels/frame, better than the best 1080p LCD TV's.<br>  <br>  It boils down to this: LCD's make great computer monitors and do well when displaying images which have a very high average pixel level )e.g. cartoons)  Plasma TV's do best when watching movies, sports and most TV.  <br>  <br>  Plasma TV's once had problems with burn in (like CRT's did), but this problem was solved 4-5 years ago (4 model generations ago). <br>  <br>  Plasma TV's used to consume large amounts of power to operate, but these days, the difference in power consumption between LCD and Plasma TV's is insignificant, say 40 watts ( a very small lightbulb!)  for a 42" TV model.  The highest performance LCD TV's actually consume more power than your typical Plasma TV!<br>  <br>  <br>  Now that Plasma TV's are actualy cheaper than LCD TV's (and are  less expensive and environmentally damaing to manufacture), you could not go wrong purchasing one of the latest 1080p models from Panasonic or Samsung.<br>  <br>  I just did.<br>  <br>  Astrobuf|`|UinOWcMUaa	LCD all the way... soon Plasma technology will be obsolete, so that and an LCD uses a lot less electricity !!<br>  <br>  This one is in LCD's favor and there's no denying it. Plasmas are prone to "image retention," or screen burn if static images are left on-screen too long. But so were the CRTs we all lived with for decades. Many plasmas are now shipping with technological tools to defeat this once it occurs, or reduce the chance of it happening. The best defense is to avoid burn entirely. This might not be easy if you're a heavy gamer, or even an addicted CNN watcher- the stock market ticker tape at the bottom of the screen has burn-in potential, even now that it's more translucent. If this is you, you know who you are and whether you need an LCD to service your habits. But if you're an average Joe who's capable of being just a little careful, don't worry about it. Also, keep in mind that after the first 100 hours or so, it gets a lot harder for any plasma to burn in.<br>  <br>  Yes, to obtain a better 1080p picture which is the highest resolution on the market... You need HDMI cables. Depending on your HD sources.. you will need 1 for each source that you will be using :) KIT if you have any questions :)|`|lA7K7Ny3aa	your better off with lcd.

If you're looking for a suggestion of which to get, I would suggest the Logitech Dual Action. It's an exact replica of a PS2 controller. If that isn't what you're looking for, I still suggest to go for a Logitech controller, as in my experiences with them they have always been responsive and durable.|`|pX7SwZh7aa	I wouldn't bother with it.

You obviously need to be VERY dedicated for that.<br>  <br>  I received it as a gift for Christmas, and I've used it every day. Use it for at least 30 minutes a day. There's yoga, "strength exercises", aerobics games (includes hula hoop, running along paths, and even this cool steppy game haha and boxing), and games. The games are really addicitng and pretty fun.<br>  <br>  Each day you can take a body test, which gives you your BMI and weight. You can also take body tests to determine your "fit age" which is how old your body is performing at.<br>  <br>  I'm not guaranteeing that you'll drop 20 lbs immediately, but it definitely keeps you toned.

"yellow slot... blue slot....." <br>  <br>  you are likely going to need step by step instructions for someone to walk you through your trouble so in this case calling vonage back would be your best option... <br>  <br>  I do not know what hardware that you have.... vonage adapter model # etc....  but in most cases... <br>  you need to have an ethernet cord connected from the router to the NIC in each computer, and to the ethernet port of the vonage ATA... some vonage ATAs have a WAN and LAN ethernet port, the internet (router) should connect to the WAN port....
oJOCxFAMaa	Okay, this is what I am understanding:<br>  PS2 -> TV (has optical audio out) -> Home theatre amplifier (has RCA in)<br>  You want to connect ur TV to ur amplifier.<br>  <br>  If you can draw block diagrams and show me how your setup is, I may be able to help. But I've never heard of optical -> RCA... :(<br>  <br>  I'm surprised that your TV doesn't have like some headphone jack on it...<br>  Headphone (3.5mm -> RCA) are common adapters.

After the time returns to the front of the box, power it back on.  A full reboot usually takes around 3 mins for a "Mystro" digital box, 7 mins for a "Mystro" hd cable card box or 2 mins for a "legacy Sara" box.

It's a great site that lets you choose pre-existing ringtones for free, segments of ringtones that you want, or you can upload and create your own ringtones. It's all free of charge, the only thing you need is internet access on your phone. You still have to pay for the internet usage through your provider, but from experience at least with AT&T, it's a very minimal fee, like 10 cents per so many kb, and it doesn't use much. The ringtones have always been good quality for me, in fact even better quality than what I have bought through the AT&T MEdia Mall.

v5VlL09iaa	Because it's trying to make you use the flash excessively. The XT, XTi, and original Rebel don't have XS in their name, so don't try to be excessive.<br>  <br>  On a serious note though. You could use P mode. It's just a bit more control than full auto. You'd have to adjust the ISO (I believe there's even an auto ISO) and decide when to use flash.|`|0AqkCOWIaa	Because you are using the Auto mode.<br>  <br>  Move beyond the Automatic mode.<br>  <br>  Why not use the AV mode?

aKLk2r7qaa	I subscribed to BT Vision and sent it straight back the same day. First, if you dont have a digital aerial, you will get only the same channels as you would through a cheap freeview box in your area.<br>  Then, I didn't want to pay per view for films so it was pointless for me anyway. I objected to having to subscribe monthly to a freeview box (regardless of whether I bought movies) when I couldnt get any extra channels than I could on my freeview box.<br>   I'm going to wait for the digital changeover and get a digital aerial and use my freeview box.|`|37a34f8e628730c3d176c1172f42446caa	Not if your looking for HD on bbc itv etc.  They only transmit HD on pay to view.

zwJbUbWMaa	Along with having the HDTV you have to pay extra through Direct TV for the HD channels and an HD receiver.  We had to do that through Dish Network.  You can either buy or rent the HD receiver and the channels add an extra $20+ onto your monthly bill.  We don't have any movie channels, just the regular channels and the HD channels and our  bill is about $90 a month now.|`|jK5FXm6Naa	The digital signal isn't great on any lcd tv, my old tv was just as good too.|`|lDC9AjFQaa	you need hd channels and a hd receiver, if not the tv only emphasizes how bad regular tv is
y8HKAhBFaa	Super Mario Galaxy:<br>  <br>  It is a very hard to beat game.. 60 stars... one star takes like one hour...

It's a sequel to my favorite game of all time. Tales Of Symphonia on the Gamecube. It has an excellent and unique battle system and a SUPER LONG story. I'm 45 hours through and still have quite a bit to go. Although it's not as good as the first it's still an amazing game that always keeps me coming back. The story is strong and emotional (though not as good as the first) and the voice acting is near perfect (i get tired of hearing Emil whine) If you decided to get it i would really recommend getting the first too because it's kind of confusing without it.<br>  <br>  Multiplayer: Super Smash Bros. Brawl.<br>  What can i say? it's brawl. An all-out nintendo war. This game, though not the best game i've ever played, is probably the most addicting. I can play for hours non-stop and there's not many things on the planet i enjoy more than coming home at the end of the week and turning my wii on, getting online, and beating all my friends to a pulp. Every wii owner needs this game.|`|EpvHhbByaa	Favorite 1 Player Wii Game: Okami, this game is actually more epic than Zelda. Intersting story and just when you think you're done with the game, the game introduces a whole new plot. (This may change as "Madworld" is being released on March 10th)<br>  <br>  Favorite Multiplayer Wii Game: I would say Super Smash Bro. Brawl, but there's too much lag online and it's too floaty compared to Melee. So I guess I have none for this choice. However, I am looking forward to "The Conduit" coming out in June|`|nQwSlue1aa	My favorite one player game is Trauma Center: Second Opinion. I like it because you are a doctor who has to heal others with incurable diseases. You are the only one who can cure them. The game is intense and challenging. It's not one of those games that you beat in about an hour or so and have nothing else to do. I don't have a favorite two player game. I don't own any two player games.|`|C7rV71Cjaa	1 player is Resident Evil 4. It has awesome controls, sweet graphics, a good plot and lots of replay value. The Legend of Zelda Twlight Princess and No More Heroes would both be my second favorite single player games.<br>  <br>  Multiplayer has to be Mario Kart Wii with big tracks, a lot of characters, and great online play. Online is WAY better than Brawl's though that would be my second.

It is priced at 299.99. The Elite is for gamers that can spend the money on it. It comes in a nice black finish and unlike the PS3 it doesn't show finger prints. It has a huge 120 GB hardrive and high defintion cords and it it the only one to have the HDMI port. It comes with Lego Indiana Jones and Kung Fu Panda games. It is priced at 399.99. It is the won I chose when i bought my Xbox 360. Happy Gaming!|`|BWm1RSGkaa	get a arcade and just buy a memory card like me and if you don't want your game's to get scratched up everytime you move your xbox while playing just get a ps3 because xbox will mess your game's up|`|rwICVyvGaa	Pro, and yeah you can say what you want about the PS3 but the live connection is far from as good a quality as the Xbox' thats why they charge.|`|gtJrUIP7aa	Get a PS3, its full HD meaning it wil play full 1080p unlike the Xbox 360 wich plays only 720p, and it comes with a built in Blu-ray dvd player (only good if you have an Hd-tv or else its like watching an HBO) it has every game the Xbox 360 has exept for the Halo and Gears of War games. Online play is free. but if your sticking with the Xbox get the Elite........|`|PVOMLCkJaa	Save money and get a PS3. It actually costs less if you plan to game online.|`|UWJinEbIaa	Arcade = $199.....no hard drive<br>  <br>  Pro = $299.....60gig HDD<br>  <br>  Elite = $399......120gig HDD + HDMI|`|PmWTRZ1haa	they are all pretty much he same but just the hardrive.<br>  The arcade does not come witha hardrive<br>  the pro comes with 60 gb<br>  the elite comes with 120gb and its black<br>  i recommend buying the arcade and buy a used hardrive and just attach it on the top, its a lot cheaper.<br>    ya dont get  ps3 its more expensive and the 360 has more and better games. more people play online, faster online gameplay.
cMdudv6aaa	They record the whole day, they also show live feed and the video it recorded can immediately be played back while the camera still continues to record what else is going on. Each dome has mutiple cams and they can watch every area that the other cams dont pick up. Every corner of the store is on cam just to let you know. They wont investigate or send anyone after you if you steal something under 5 bucks though, unless you do it constantly.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   What you tryna steal?|`|AA10929465	All of the above.<br>  1.

b5T2mQhbaa	It is the same rate - only to those who are calling in your "local" area. Whatever your area code is "set to" that is who can call you with no charge - outside of your area code - long distance charges would apply. Example:  Some internet phone companies let you have an Arizona phone number in Texas. So Texas people calling you would have a long distance charge - even if they ARE across the street.|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	It's the same as a landline.|`|457100fed3620574b42ee7b208682b1faa	as long as you got a local area code to the people who were calling you then they would be charged for a normal local call... if you got an area code that was long distance to the people who were calling you then they would be charged long distance rates to call you...

4cMuedpWaa	When you start a contract, you usually have 30 days to exchange your phone.<br>  <br>  Just because you don't like what you got though, might be not enough reason for AT&T to allow you to switch for free.<br>  <br>  You might end up paying a little fee (restocking fee) in order to get another phone.|`|NhF9sM5jaa	you should have a 30 day warranty<br>  go to wherever you bought it with your contract and receipt and talk to them|`|iq67KsNXaa	Well my friend just got an AT&T Propel ( it's really cool) and he's thinking about returning it even though I am going to convince him to never do that. Anyway, AT&T lets you try the phone out for 30 days. If you keep it for more than 30 days, it isn't free to switch right away. But if you do return it within 30 days, then you can restart and keep looking. Does that make sense? If you have had that phone for less than 30 days, get rid of it. If not, sorry.|`|AfwVMVHcaa	you can return it and ask if you can switch phones and upgrade, but that will mean a longer contract and more things. i suggest you buy the phone at full retail online because you can buy it refurbished for $209.99, and you won't be told you should upgrade.<br>  <br>  if you don't believe me check out this link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wireless.att.com/cell-phone-service/cell-phones/refurb-phones.jsp?rel=nofollow&wtSlotClick=1-001O38!CIPHMQ01-3-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.wireless.att.com/cell-phone-s...</a>|`|vBmKy6i6aa	i would go into the store and talk to them. i am going to warn you, if you have a contract with them and you just got your phone, its going to cost extra to switch because after youve been with them for so long you get a free upgrade.

One phone that is good for me, is not necessarily good for you.<br>  So the only way youre going to get an answer that is non biased is by asking the question: "which verizon phone best suits my needs?"<br>  You then give us a list of things which are the most important. With that list, we can tell you what phones you should consider<br>  Once you have a few phone suggestions, you then compare them between one another. Say your main need is a nice web browsing experience. You can ask another question with the comparison on the two phones 'Is  a wap browser more advanced then an html browser?" <br>  The answer is no. A html browser is more advanced then a wap browser..<br>  "Please compare the navigation of the internet between a trackball and dpad?" <br>  A trackball is much easier to use because there is no set distance a single click on the dpad takes you. A dpad is often difficult to click links on websites that are small. if you simply have a number for a page, then you might have to click the dpad numerous times just to hit the small number link.<br>  This is how everyone shopping for a phone should do it. You will get answers that are much more relevant to your needs, and youll be happier with the device.

TQfVWzt5aa	Its good but there are flaws, for one you would not want it to automatically reduce the speed, what you want it to do is to let the driver know and if he or she so chooses, they can slow down, but you would need to invent something that would be able to detect these cameras, and then, what if the did not send out a frequency? Then your whole idea would be ruined. Its a great Idea and would sell well, you just need to be realistic about the whole thing.|`|SsB7aRExaa	First you have to invent something that can detect the camera.    <br>  <br>  From an engineering perspective I can tell you that won't be easy.  The camera is a passive device, unlike a radar or laser speed gun.  It doesn't emit anything, so detecting it will be nearly impossible.  I'm not saying it CANNOT be done, but I will say that such a device would be in the realm of a very sophisticated military device, with a price tag to match.  Not economically viable for the ordinary person.<br>  <br>  I don't think you are going to get a good grade for a business idea that relies on wishful thinking.  For a good grade, it's got to be realistic.|`|HyPN2yleaa	I think an invention like that already exists.  Its called a radar detector.  Its this thing that when something is tracking the speed of your car, it beeps to let you know to slow down.  Plus, anything that will automatically decelerate your car sounds dangerous.  What if a car is too close behind you and the car slows down really fast?  It will cause accidents.  The best idea is to not speed in the first place unless you wanted a ticket.
N2p30Mo4aa	I would hook the dvd and the ps3 to the tv with hdmi.  send an optical from the ps3 to the dvd/receiver.<br>  <br>  use component for the cable box and send an rca to the receiver (if it has the input, otherwise the tv).  Dvi-Hdmi doesn't send audio.  You'll have to refer to your tvs owners manual as to how to input sound.  some tvs have a slot for it right buy the HDMI, however my LG didn't.  had some stupid headphone jack...meant for pc.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't be too concerned with getting high quality cables for your HD box because cable doesn't brodcast in 1080p. There are a very small amount of ppv channels that do, but the majority doesn't and probably won't for awhile.   But if budget isn't a concern, better quality never hurts.<br>  <br>  In the end, I'd concentrate more on getting the ps3 and dvd hooked up with surround sound because they'll utilize it way more than an HDbox|`|UinOWcMUaa	You could put your 1 of your connections using componet cables (r,g,b) or buy an HDMI splitter (2 n 1) :)|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	Here's another example of why HTIBs suck--teriible connection options.<br>  <br>  DVI is video only.  Send your video from the cable to the TV directly using DVI and send the audio via optical to the "receiver".  Then send the audio and video from the PS3 to the receiver via HDMI.  You'll have to then forward the video to the TV with another HDMI.<br>  <br>  That's the only way I see you getting surround sound out of both your PS3 and the cable.

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	Megapixel resolution is about potential photo size, not picture quality.<br>  <br>  Most companies are touting high mega pixel to sell cameras, but high mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for large pictures or enlarging parts of pictures. Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches.  <br>  Click links below for more details. <br>  <a href="http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-path=398&pq-locale=en_US&_requestid=2039" rel="nofollow">http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.j...</a> ... <br>  <a href="http://www.danscamera.com/Learning/going_digital/#resolution" rel="nofollow">http://www.danscamera.com/Learning/going...</a> ...<br>  <br>  Would choose a 3 MP setting unless you plan to print a photo larger than 8 x 10 inches.  You actually lose picture quality when you crop a higher MP photo down to a smaller size.  It also takes more money, memory space, processing, and transmission time with a higher setting.<br>  <br>  Click this link for other camera tips and complete instructions on cleaning camera and battery electrical contacts. <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/base/a/4210404/D13701973093918363271" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/base/a/4210404/D13...</a>|`|i5OVORXgaa	Basically, the more megapixels you have, the bigger you can print.|`|cMdudv6aaa	Megapixel is the quality not size of photo. A size of a photo can be re sized to as big or small as you want it to be. The lower the megapixel the lower the quality will be when the picture is enlarged., <br>  <br>  Megapixel determines the quality. Pixels are tiny(micro) squares in the picture. The more tiny (micro) squares you have, the better defined the quality will be. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Think of it like this..(example)<br>  say you need to print a photo out...<br>  5 Megapixel = Printing a picture on a brick<br>  10 Megapixel = printing on paper<br>  <br>  The squares in the brick is too big to print out fine detail.<br>  The squares in the paper are very tiny, quality will be fine and smooth.<br>   <br>  <br>  More megapixel is worth. But don't be fooled. Some Cameras that produce more megapixel may have slow shutter, different iso settings and configurations. Some 7 Megapixel cameras 'might' produce better images than a camera that is said to produce 10 megapixel. There's lots of factors. So review all the specs of each camera. But that's how megapixels work.|`|xG5ZlJDqaa	Image quality depends more on the lens, camera processing, sensor, and the photographer than how many megapixels a camera has. Today's camera has at least 6 megapixels, more than enough for most people. 5 megapixels is good enough for prints of at least A4. 10 megapixels pretty much enables poster-size printing. To determine absolute image quality though, and whether its worth the price difference, it would have helped if you specified the brand and model of the cameras you are looking at~|`|qaYj8o73aa	camera images are measured in megapixels -> a higher number of megapixels = a larger photograph and better quality<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.digicamhelp.com/camera-features/camera-parts/megapixels.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.digicamhelp.com/camera-featur...</a>

Look if it has a ring that goes around the edge of game. If so, you're going to have to get a new one. Also, a lot of times the GAME can actually overheat if it has been played for a long time. If you still can't figure it out, call Microsoft.
