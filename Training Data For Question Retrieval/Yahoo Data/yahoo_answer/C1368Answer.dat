AA12360662	You probably answered you own question.  Yes, your boy friend may be having the need to vent out his frustration, but more to that, projecting raping you is a symbolic way to say that he wants to have control, he wants to take charge.<br>  <br>  In other words, he really revealed his true personalities.  Because you two are not living together (I assumed), the feeling of winning is not there.  After each argument, in his subconscious mind, the action of raping is like winning and take control of things he felt he was in lack.  <br>  <br>  He may not do it in reality due to the fact that you don't live together, or not committing each others yet (marriage), but that thought of raping is actual thought of violence behavior.  <br>  <br>  I would be more careful if I were you, sometimes dreams do reveal a person's deep inside.  But one thing you should be happy about.  At least he is honest with you and told you the dream.|`|AZv0ON1Laa	Doesn't seem normal to me.Mabye he likes it in the dream because he will do it,but that's just me it could be just one of those weird dreams no one can explain.|`|lrjCsFGpaa	In some ways,it can be normal.Maybe he does just need to get his frustration out,he probably would never do that.|`|fNctrQ4Haa	Didn't I just answered this?|`|uRQoj2wcaa	WTF|`|8d8ejHPfaa	If you've been together for 3 years, and nothing of the sort has ever happened, then yeah, I think your instincts are correct here.  Rape in the real world isn't about sex, but about violence and control of another.  In the action here, it sounds like he is playing out anger he wouldn't express to you directly, and when he chokes you because you get too loud, it's basically a way of cutting off what you are saying to him when you fight.  That he's smiling all the while he's doing this suggests that he would rather maintain a "happy face", and not deal with underlying issues in the relationship altogether, if you know what I mean?  It seems like he really hates it when you fight, and would rather not address issues at all if it were possible to maintain a calm and happy home life.  It seems as though he didn't learn a healthy way to communicate with you when you have issues together, and he would rather avoid the subject altogether if he could.  Perhaps some kind of training together in communication would help him to re-frame his symbols, and help you to get issues out without it distressing him so much...good luck...|`|aVbLngqmaa	It's perfectly normal. I have dreams of my boyfriend raping me and I like it. People can't really control what makes them sexually aroused. It doesn't mean anything in the real world. Just fantasy. Seriously, no worries if he's not hurting you and you know he wouldn't.

How silly, looking back on it.|`|wkjncmHTaa	No, that one passed me by. I was more into reading and sports.

I remember school days where you would be "going out" with someone without either of the two actually asking one another out.  Your friends would hook it all up and you would be an item.|`|z2xRXM5Laa	No, I never did.  I have been a lifelong lesbian and I've never been into guys.  No offense to men.

Of course, that was back in 1979...now it just seems a pleasant if silly memory but at the time I probably felt like I could die of love.|`|un0C52G8aa	No, because boys used to tease me and I hated it. I used to try to deal with it by ignoring them.|`|LR48Rtv2aa	Nope.

LOL
I6hd2rfKaa	i not going to judge you. it is not my place to do that. i think your very brave to put all your info on the web like this even if people dont know who you are. for the people who call you names dont worry about them. they obviously have nothing better to do with thier lives than tease other people im mean what are the doing with THIER lives. they are the ones without destinies,not you. your grades are another story. i am not having the best of luck with those either thats is nothing to be ashamed of you are who ou are.i personally no how hard it is to ask questions and look like a dumb*** in front of people. but dont sweat it when you are going off to college fulfilling your destinies they will still be in grade 10 still not smart enough to ask questions. as for your body.... it not important what they think. im not going to say looks dont matter but take care of yourself( im not saying your not). Those people who are making fun of you need to grow the **** up! i dont know what school you school you go to or what names they call you but calling names are for 2nd graders as far a im concerned. im sure you dont suck at sports,education or making friends so im not going to make fun of you.you seem like a nice person so i dont see why you cant make friends maybe they are just stupid. sports aren't that important so dont worry about them. i know you dont suck at education so dont say stuff like that.you have a destiny. God made it but it is your job to find it!<br>  Good luck!<br>  ---hope this helps!---|`|cFrtOg45aa	You have the power to choose your own destiny. Maybe you just haven't found what your talented in. Hang in there you will find it. We all do. In the meantime you need to change your attitude and think positive and know that you are worthy of having it all. If you have faith in yourself and keep a positive attitude your dreams will become real. Of course it will take hard work and you will stumble along the way but we all have. That is what make people winners. That is what separates winners from losers. So hang in there and be the best that you can be.|`|LsBS5bOCaa	You should ask yourself what is it that you like to do. There must be something you like....a passion...a hobby. And capitalize on that. Stop saying to yourself you will never achieve anything. Okay, so you're having problems in a subject. You don't have big muscles, and your not into sports. Big deal.  I'll bet underneath all of that confusion and doubt there's a songwriter, a poet, a comedian, an author, a make-up or hairstylist, etc....something good is in you and just haven't found it yet.  Your still too young. And if your having that much problems in school, maybe your parent should take you to get tested..you could have some kind of learning disability. But it doesn't mean you can't be successful in life, period. Just gotta believe and think positive. I know it's hard, but anything is possible.|`|MWWUPWNiaa	Id be your friend you never asked. Your not the only one with a sucky life. my dads a drug addict moms always knocked and im super smart but am too caught up in my thoughts to show that. I have 1 friend and even she is getting on my last nerve. Your not alone. For some strange reason right at your age your hormones change how you feel which eventually changes your life. Dont give up and dont end it because you are meant to do something in life you just havent found what your good at. Ever try writing? or getting into music. I swear I never knew what I wanted in life and now that I feel like I no everyones telling me ill never make it. I will . You will. conquer the world and dont give up hopee.|`|QAtpLEEFaa	Well, your account is direct and moving - so you obiviously have at least one talent.... the ablity to communicate.<br>  <br>  Stephen Hawkings, and thousands of other talented people  wouldn't have been particularly good at sports. so thats not worth botherng about.<br>  <br>  Neverthelss because of your situation - of being locked into hours at the one institution where ,,,, being popular , good at  sports and  achieving  well in education .... is the dominant culture,  its understable that, although you are a socially intellgent  you feel rotten at the moment.<br>  <br>  You can address' getting too angry too quickly' - I'd see that as the aspect of your life you should focus  on right now..  there a a range of assertiveness training and anger management web sites.  This one looks good to start with|`|hmNY4gQtaa	stop saying all of that<br>  <br>  That is your problem : you are in a downward spiral with that kind of thinking<br>  <br>  Believe in yourself, work harder, try harder, do everything with all your heart, don't let anyone make you feel bad about yourself<br>  <br>  Be coherent with what you want : if you want to be good in school, study hard, really hard, and do it again, and again and again, you'll find tricks in your studying and you'll become,<br>  <br>  Transpose that principal in every aspect of your life. If you give up every time you fail of course you will end up a failure. Remember what Henry Ford said "Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently."|`|3rv5mjfeaa	it is supposed to be i have never achieved ANYTHING in my life. You have a double negative.|`|BWBChnw8aa	Wow, seems like you don't have very much in the way of support. You probably have a better chance at being wealthy than most of the highly educated people in society today. The identification of everything you spoke of is key to making the decision of acheivement if you desire to. If you desire to be an out of the ordinary highly succesful person, its truly up to you! There are many respected wealthy people that never completed the levels of education that society dictates a person to have. They simply chose to be successful and sought out the means to take them there. You are destined to have whatever it is you desire the most in life. If you desire nothing, nothing you will have. If you desire to change the world you live in, it begins with the choice to do so. Please take a deep breath and realize you will be a product of your own dreams if you pursue them. Your life impacts those that you will probably never know were watching. Find out what you love to do the most, and learn how to make money at it, and you will be successful.<br>  Remember and take this to heart."If it's to be, it's up to me!"|`|P5FC4cOqaa	If this problem is occuring try to go to the doctor to see what is wrong. I am not saying that you have a problem but there may be something that could be bothering you on the inside. When you study, do you have other things on your mind. You say that people call you names. Maybe you keep focusing on what people say instead of believing in yourself. You are probably pushing yourself to hard or maybe you are no giving yourself enough time. Who else will you blame your situation on. Your not dumb. That fact that you said that you have nothing to fall back on means that you have not explored other areas of learning you may be interested in. I hope that this advice helps you. Just know that there are those who are in worse situations than you|`|wKwp6rA3aa	I am in grade 9 and I haven't really achieving anything if my life either but it doesn't mean that you have to give up.I haven't gave up, so why should you?Don't listen to what other people say.They are just criticizing you.You said that you study hard for your tests and quizzes and still don't understand.You should ask your teachers and they should be happy to help you out.I don't mean this in a rude way, but I think you are stressing yourself to much because I used to study for like 2-3 hours and still have nothing memorized and same with my best friend but our teacher last year told us that we shouldn't stress ourselves to much and it should be easier. You can also try to improve your study habits if you study everything the day before, it is nearly impossible to memorize everything.Try to take it little by little each day but not like one thing and that is it for the day.Then the last day before the test/quiz, review everything. Also, take breaks about 10-15 minute breaks while studying such as every hour, take 10-15 minute breaks.Again,I don't mean this in a bad or mean way, but when you put your head in the dumps, everyone else will consider you "in the dumps".Don't listen what other people say,they are just criticizing.It doesn't matter what other people think of you.It was you think of yourself.Many leaders in the world have been critized by people but they didn't give up.So why should you?I am not saying to have your heads up in the clouds, but don't have them low in the dumps.<br>  I hope you take my advice and I really hope it helps because to tell the truth, I have learned all this from advice from one of my awesome teachers as advice and some as experience.<br>  GOOD LUCK!!!!<br>  You said that you suck at making friends...What are you talking about?You have great friends on here!!!!!!=)

ApELEov7aa	I am determined to grow positively. Through all of my experiences, I pull wisdom from my experiences to learn. Whenever I have a problem, I identify it and search through experiences or research ways to fix it. Learning from experience is a method of facing on-going problems, although it is questioned in the Psychology world, past mistakes give insight into the future and if one did not spend time fixing old mistakes or learning from them, the problem will continue to get worse. The Humanistic approach is based on human experience and questions objective  knowledge.

As the largest, most powerful nation in the amazon region, and with an energy economy largely dependent on biofuels, Brazil has the most incentive to use the Amazon properly. I don't know 100% what they're doing right now, but that has to be the right direction to look in.
YQOT68xFaa	I knew a guy just like that. Totally fried. <br>  <br>  Your friend and the guy I know, who is just like that, are pathological liars.|`|i2ff7XSNaa	Well the example you stated for your friend just seems like he forgets little things or gets them confused for other things.<br>  Though this can well be a trait for a pathological liar.<br>  I do believe I have been told that this is a medical condition, it has to deal with little impulses in the brain that would trigger an individual to persistently lie. They have therapist for these kind of persons.<br>  A pathological liar is an individual who feels the need to constantly lie, regardless of how simple or how drastic the lie maybe they can't help it. A regular liar is just someone who lies once in a while, and has a meaning for doing so. Unlike a pathological liar, a regular liar can stop if he or she wishes. Majority of the time they'll lie to feel important or get attention.<br>  <br>  I hope this was what you were looking for! :)
PcGvS4Xuaa	I once had a dream that me and my sister died. When we were in heaven, I was taken aside and told that something had gone wrong and we weren't supposed to both be there, and in order to fix things, one of us had to leave and cease to exist, so I volunteered and didn't tell my sister because she was so happy to be in heaven.<br>  <br>  I'm not dead and I still exist, so I agree with you, it's a load of crap.|`|QSShHlRiaa	im sorry to say but you may actually die...<br>  about a month ago i had c|`|2GNFQPdmaa	That whole thing was invented for the movies.

5N3odm3Qaa	It's not a myth because nobody says that. One's social circle has absolutely nothing to do with wealth. They are 100% unrelated.<br>  <br>  I know that poor people can have boring social lives but you should have met my parents, too. In their 25 years of marriage, they have gone out maybe a dozen times. My parents' friends were limited almost entirely to people met through work and in their field (both were doctors). They were just not social people. Many doctors are like this. Some CEOs have to maintain a busy social life because so much of what they do is political and not based on skill (as opposed to law and medicine). Maybe individuals with less money are not able to afford to socialize as much as those with a healthy savings account but they may well be happier. Jobs that pay a lot tend to come with greater stress. Happiness is hard when the daily grind is too distracting and demanding to enjoy one's (social) life.<br>  <br>  There is no proportionality of social life to wealth. None at all. That's like asking if there is a relationship between having brown hair and being wealthy.|`|LsBS5bOCaa	It can be proportional if they have been networking with the right kind of people to get to where they want to be.  Could they be any happier? I believe once they have achieved, yes they are happier. Wouldn't you? But, once too much pride, cynicism, and paranoia takes over, eventually happiness goes.
VelE30y7aa	Alright. Im a lucid dreamer. But against my own will.<br>  <br>  The journal helps a lot. But here are some handy steps.This might take a while(a week) so be patient.<br>  <br>  When you go to sleep, examine the palm of your hand, and tell yourself that when you see this in your dream, you will know your dreaming. Then while your falling asleep keep running that thought through your mind until you fall asleep. Keep a journal, as usual. Before each night look at your palm and tell yourself, when your dreaming and you see your palm you will know it is a dream. Oh, and quick tip. When the lucid dream arrives, do not do anything drastic, because you will wake up. Follow along with the dream, and keep it real. But you will be aware it's a dream. Interesting things happen :)|`|vfjKzvyfaa	ill try my best....<br>  <br>  first off you need to set your alarm to the time you would normally get up, wake up but dont get up and get all energized, instead try to remember your dreams, read a book, something that keep you relaxed. then go back to sleep for an hour or so. you have more chances of having lucid dreams during that time. <br>  <br>  in order to prepare for that you should to reality checks/dream checks throughout the day so that when you remember to do this in an actual dream you'll be able to stay asleep and have control over what you're dreaming<br>  <br>  check that you're awake through out the day by touching your palm making sure it feel normal<br>  <br>  look at text on a book/magazine, or sing... look away, then look back it the text changes you're dreaming, <br>  <br>  look at the time, if it changes you're not dreaming<br>  <br>  try to turn on and off a light or an electric item.. for some reason electric things do not work in dreams. <br>  <br>  once you know you're dreaming, spin around in circles... this will make you get deeper into the dream and you'll have more control over it. <br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|lTLSqLOwaa	I keep a dream journal and I try to notice any unusual things in dreams that might not be real in real life.

AA12360662	Truck - bold decision<br>  <br>  This dream is involved with the relationship with your boy friend.  You may have some tough decision to make in terms of things going on with him.  However, you project he drove away from you, that is a symbolic way to say you are feeling left out, disrespect.  <br>  <br>  Being lost and waling down a road while it was raining may reflect the feeling disappointment,   Your step dad in this case symbolizes support you are looking for.<br>  <br>  In other words, you may have some tough or even wrong decision you made in life, whether it is about your boy friend directly,  examine your life, you will know that somehow you may have regret about it.|`|NMdUVtViaa	The truck, depending on the color, could mean alot of different things.  If its a dull color and in poor condtion, it could mean that your disatisified, and becuase its something he doesnt have, you want something different, and bold.  Since he leaves you, it tends to add to the fact that your dissatifisied, especally becuase you have to depend on someone else to help you.  As much as you want him to be the strong rebel type (feeling like sneeking out of the house, truck, driving away in the rain at night), he isint what your looking for.  Again, other things in the dream can change the meaning, however, the fact that he leaves you alone in the rain (presumably at night becuase your sneaking out) is not good and shows how unhappy you are.

Let's pray for your friend.  I am sure, God will answer our prayers and work a miracle in his life.<br>  <br>  2.  Both of you, make the commitment now to marry soon after your friend is evicted because God will honour your marriage and bless you because He is a holy God.<br>  <br>  3.  Be grateful to God when He has worked the miracle for you.<br>  <br>  Praying much for God to bless you both.
pqMb1jsKaa	Dude, don't worry about it.  Put up with the losers for a couple of years, and you'll probably never see them again anyway.  The best thing you can do is to try to figure out just what it is that you want to do in life, and if needs be, swallow some pride and re-take some of your exams, then work through the necessary qualifications (uni, post-graduate, etc) and get on with it.<br>  <br>  I also found that if you can get yourself into a university on a course that you really want to do, you'll meet like minded people, and if nothing else, it lets you get away from these chav-like people, away from all the social constraints that you build up around yourself throughout your early teenage years, and make a fresh start so that you can truly be yourself and not who everyone else expects you to be.<br>  <br>  Get your nose in those books, dude.  Good luck.  =)

0d8e2fb9186a53013b715c0656473377aa	The question is unclear. Did you mean: <br>  <br>  In psychology, what are the different theories relating to homosexuality?<br>  <br>  If so, I suspect there is a wide range of theories and point of views in psychology regarding homosexuals. Homosexuality and Psychology have an intertwined history in that Psychology gave the sexual preference its final classification declaring<br>  <br>  homosexuality: a separate sexual orientation and a deviant sexual practice. <br>  <br>  From the nineteen century up to the 70’s, psychology considered homosexuality to be a psychological disorder, and homosexuals as individuals who must be “forcibly cured.” Most psychologists concluded that homosexuality was a curable condition.. Freud’s psychoanalysis was frequently used in the treatment of homosexuality. Psychology’ point of view on homosexuality participated to an increasing number of homosexuals placed in mental hospitals and prisons. A variety of therapies to "cure" homosexuality, included aversion therapy, nausea producing drugs, castration, electric shock, brain surgery, breast amputations, and hypnosis…<br>  <br>  In the 70’s, the APA finally removed homosexuality from the sexual deviancy section. Not sooner than 1992, world health organization ceased to classify it as a mental disorder. The reasons for the change are still being debated by theorists and else. <br>  <br>  Nowadays, the majority of mental health professionals renounced the idea of homosexuality as a mental disorder. Although few conservative and religious groups still advocate an alternative psychology and regards homosexuality as a sexual disorder.<br>  New psychological theories focus now on heterosexism and hatred of homosexuals (or homophobia).|`|AA11094648	In what sense? Elaborate! <br>  <br>  It's like saying what do psychologists say about straight people. <br>  <br>  If you elaborate your question though, I'll elaborate my answer.|`|AA10894849	Depends on the psychologist you ask.  The general consensus in the psychology world is that homosexuality is not immoral, bizarre, or "insane." Homosexuality was entirely removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in 1986.<br>  Here is the American Psychological Association's take on homosexuality:<br>  Guideline 1.  Psychologists understand that homosexuality and bisexuality are not indicative of mental illness. <br>  <br>  Guideline 2.  Psychologists are encouraged to recognize how their attitudes and knowledge about lesbian, gay, and bisexual issues may be relevant to assessment and treatment and seek consultation or make appropriate referrals when indicated.<br>  <br>  Guideline 3.  Psychologists strive to understand the ways in which social stigmatization (i.e., prejudice, discrimination, and violence) poses risks to the mental health and well-being of lesbian, gay, and bisexual clients.<br>  <br>  Guideline 4.  Psychologists strive to understand how inaccurate or prejudicial views of homosexuality or bisexuality may affect the client’s presentation in treatment and the therapeutic process.<br>  <br>  Guideline 5.  Psychologists strive to be knowledgeable about and respect the importance of lesbian, gay, and bisexual relationships. <br>  <br>  Guideline 6.  Psychologists strive to understand the particular circumstances and challenges facing lesbian, gay, and bisexual parents.<br>  <br>  Guideline 7.  Psychologists recognize that the families of lesbian, gay, and bisexual people may include people who are not legally or biologically related.<br>  <br>  Guideline 8.  Psychologists strive to understand how a person’s homosexual or bisexual orientation may have an impact on his or her family of origin and the relationship to that family of origin.<br>  <br>  Guideline 9.  Psychologists are encouraged to recognize the particular life issues or challenges experienced by lesbian, gay, and bisexual members of racial and ethnic minorities that are related to multiple and often conflicting cultural norms, values, and beliefs.<br>  <br>  Guideline 10.  Psychologists are encouraged to recognize the particular challenges experienced by bisexual individuals.<br>  <br>  Guideline 11.  Psychologists strive to understand the special problems and risks that exist for lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth.<br>  <br>  Guideline 12.  Psychologists consider generational differences within lesbian, gay, and bisexual populations, and the particular challenges that may be experienced by lesbian, gay, and bisexual older adults.<br>  <br>  Guideline 13.  Psychologists are encouraged to recognize the particular challenges experienced by lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals with physical, sensory, and/or cognitive/emotional disabilities.<br>  <br>  Guideline 14.  Psychologists support the provision of professional education and training on lesbian, gay, and bisexual issues.<br>  <br>  Guideline 15.

c8ac75a975fb286b9e5fa3746ac85061aa	If the Sun didn't rise then it would probably be the end of the world.  One of five things could account for the Sun not rising.  The first possible way is that the Earth could cease to rotate.  If the Earth were to cease rotation one side would be too hot for human life and the other would be too cold for human life.  The second possibility is that the Sun could have somehow ceased to exist which would end with the entire world freezing to death.  The third possibility would be some sort of sustained Solar Eclipse which would mean that the moon had ceased to revolve around the Earth which would end up killing everyone.  The fourth possibility is that some large asteroid or some such was blocking the Sun's rays which may or may not lead to the end of life on Earth depending where the asteroid was heading.  The fifth and final possible thing that could cause the Sun not to rise would be the second coming of Christ and in that case I would expect to see Him arrive in such a manner that everyone would bow and profess that He was the Lord.<br>  <br>  The psychological effect on a thinking person would be to realize that one of the reasons I listed must be the cause of it.

Its all about getting your point across to the client/customer you want to 'churn'!<br>  <br>  First:<br>  Hang around with your top sales people for a while and watch them 'trick people'! Jot down points of why you think they are effective.<br>  <br>  Next:<br>  Try being innovative and come up with a sales pitch [THAT PUTS YOUR POINTS ACROSS WITHOUT BEING VERBOSE] and use it on your friends and ask for their feedback. Make sure you do not learn it, but instead know what you are talking about ... that way it won't seem made up. Try integrating the 'essence' of your peers' sales pitch ... do not steal their lines ... they may be annoyed and may get you to play ball in third tier segments.<br>  <br>  Finally:<br>  When you go to pitch at someone ... <br>  <br>  (A) in case if its door-to-door ... identify your target segment and accordingly spend time convincing them .... if you think they're not budging ... move on!) Be Friendly ... if you have a feeling they 'might' give in ... ask for water ... act as if you are tired ... talk about what you think they might relate to ... e.g. ... to a person from Asia, you might want to tell them you like so-and-so cuisine ... blah ... blah and somehow connect it to your product.<br>  <br>  (B) If its on the Phone: - YOU NEED BETTER ENGLISH and good comeback answers i.e. - PRESENCE OF MIND.|`|14225e0db44f9ad998485df2853c6279aa	With such terrible grammar in your question, I would probably suggest that you learn how to speak.  Try that.|`|2JjTsVfUaa	Focus on A) personality & B) discipline.<br>  <br>  A) Work on yourself to have a genuinely sunny disposition. Develop a positive attitude toward people and things. Look for the best in everything. Never carry personal baggage (problems, worries etc) inside the work place (leave it at the doorstep). Even if working the phones, this outlook will seep through to the prospect. Be truthful (have the client's best interest in mind, always.. ...which also translates to work for an honest company and make an honest living)<br>  <br>  B) At the beginning, atleast until you master your craft, show up to work earlier than everybody and leave later (atleast as reasonably as possible, balancing it with other prior commitments you may have). Listen and learn from the best of peers. Practice their best skills...you can always adapt it to yourself later. Always be curious about them. Praise them for their talent and ask them to share it with you. Also show your gratitude. Take any professional sales coaching available.<br>  <br>  Part of this discipline is :<br>  <br>  1) Listen to your prospects. (remember the cliche': there is a reason for having two ears and one mouth). <br>  <br>  2) Know your product or service inside out. This is a must.<br>  <br>  3) Once you have understood a prospect's needs, have educated them amd matched them with the right product or service, learn to ask for the business with pride (closing skill). Again another practice-able/learned skill.<br>  -------------------------------------<br>  May the force be with you. (it always is...so use it :-)|`|AA10575825	Sales, that can be a tough career choice if you have not learned to connect with people.<br>  <br>  The first step in becoming a successful salesperson is passion. You must be truly passionate about the product you are selling. To gauge your level of passion you must know your product inside out and the benefits of the product.<br>  <br>  The second step is to anticipate the customer's needs and explain as best as you can without patronizing them the benefits of the product or the service you are offering.<br>  <br>  Other ways to win sales are to: acknowledge the customer when they enter the shop, complement them - what a beautiful scarf etc - be truthful - this is called an ice breaker;<br>  find out what what brings them to your shop, if you don't have the exact same product you they require provide alternatives, tell them your name and tell them to call you if they need more help (Back off, but keep an eye on them to see if you are needed.);<br>  re-approach, where the customer lingers on,  invite them to sample the product, try it on, have a taste etc.. if they are serious they will buy.<br>  <br>  Try to recognize the window shoppers, a little chit-chat and they will be back with a purpose in the future, if you are rude, they will not give you their money.<br>  <br>  Finally, good grooming, a pleasant personality, will go a long way to help you perform professionally.
b84d7911d5ccdd8307819497c93c5e82aa	When negotiating an international sales contract, both parties need to pay as much attention to the terms of sale as to the sales price.  To make it as clear as possible, an international set of trade terms (INCOTERMS) has been adopted by most countries that defines exactly the responsibilities and risks of both the buyer and seller including while the merchandise is in transit.<br>  <br>  FOB = Free Onboard Vessel, named ocean port of shipment.  This term is used for ocean shipments only where it is important that the goods pass the ship's rail.<br>  <br>  So, for example, it might be FOB Norfolk, VA, which means responsibility for the goods transfer to the buyer as soon as the goods are put onboard the ship in Norfolk, Virginia.  At that point, the buyer must pay for transporting the goods on the ocean vessel, pay to clear the items through customs at the destination country, and pay to trasport the goods to the buyer's warehouse.  The buyer should also be insuring the goods during this portion of the journey against loss or damage.<br>  <br>  CFR = Cost and Freight, named ocean port of destination.  This term is used for ocean shipments that are not containerized.<br>  <br>  CIF = Cost, Insurance and Freight, named ocean port of destination.  This term is used for ocean shipments that are not containerized.|`|IGLggE3daa	In reference to economics, trade and finance, the three abbreviations you cite are most likely:<br>  <br>  FOB= Free On Board.

xhz1kWroaa	No, I don't believe that people should put any worth into being popular in the long run.  I know and realize that in high school this is often something that many kids dream of, is being popular, but in the long run, it does not matter.  When we get more mature, we start to act more like ourselves around whomever and not just in the name of popularity.  Take this, for instance.  When my father went to his ten-year high school reunion, he said that some of the "popular" girls did not look nearly as pretty as they had ten years ago and most of them were single, divorced, and not very happy with kids to take care of.  Trust me, being popular might matter when one is younger, but in the long run, its "importance" gets completely ruled out by more mature matters in life.|`|0sgFAH1Naa	its not worth being popular at all. seriously, i don't understand what the big deal about being popular is. the way i see it, when you're popular, people know your name, and know all about you, even stuff you may not want them to know. like i know this person who is popular, and she went out with this guy, broke up with him and broke his heart. well, everyone heard about it and now all his friends and so many people hate her. and want to beat her up because of her. also, the way i see it, popular people a lot of the time will have people talk good about them to their face, but then once you turn around, they're stabbed in the back. so in my opinion, it wouldn't be that great to be popular and its definately not worth all of that.

Statistics and research methods is a required unit for two of the three years on all undergrad psychology degrees i believe. <br>  <br>  You actually don't even need psychology a-level to study it at uni, but it does help, and will tell you if you really like it or not. <br>  <br>  Ideally, in my opinion, if you want a headstart on a psychology degree, take psychology, maths and biology at a-level, and maybe english to, if you want to take four. These will be the most helpful. But you dont have to take any of them. You could get onto a psycholgy degree course with 3 completely random a-levels.|`|990226c0e689c6bc05cdf5b039c6d582aa	Well you're not going to get very far if you can't even spell "psychologist".<br>  <br>  Yes you do need a lot of A levels and it would be best if you have maths since there is a lot of statistics involved but you should check this out with the uni you want to go to since all uni's have different entry requirements.|`|94aba59f98c3e6cd010f7fd2e8c3e40aaa	You don't need ALevels to become a psychologist but you do need them to get in to university to study psychology as a degree.

To get a decent job you'd need to go to grad school and get a PhD or a Psy. D which will require "A's"
AA11094648	Yes, if that memory existed in the long term memory. <br>  <br>  If the information trying to be recalled was never transferred to the long-term memory, then no, it would not be possible to retrieve it. <br>  <br>  But the long-term memory is thought to be infinite in space and time and therefore if a memory is there, then yes, with the right cue, in theory you should be able to recall any memory. <br>  <br>  Of course finding the right cues isn't an easy thing, along with other factors that have to be included, such as repression of traumatic memories etc. There's also the issue of things such as confabulation, which bring up questions of whether we can 'trust' our memory. But that's a whole other essay....<br>  <br>  But basically, in theory, the answer is yes.|`|d13e28ec0f8488f329d563f0d92c0860aa	Yes.  Nothing is ever lost|`|AA10669573	Yes, hypnosis.|`|c7c0e0855bbe2cbc96ee08b04d18ab30aa	Not any memory. The brain is very efficient. If you go a long time without using a certain memory or certain knowledge, your brain will actually get rid of that memory and replace it with something else.<br>  Of course, its possible that that memory still resides somewhere deep in your subconscious and could possibly be retrieved under the right conditions. Some people thin hypnotherapy works, other people think it's a bunch of BS. Really, science doesn't know what much of the brain is really used for, so it's all a mystery.|`|fa38719d8736dc9f4d52fbb68952624eaa	Forget retrieving!  <br>  <br>  Let me know if they come up with anything to get rid of them!

In a very real<br>  sense we have two minds, one that thinks and one that<br>  feels" (Daniel Goleman, Emotional Intelligence,<br>  Bloomsbury Publishing, London, 1996, page 8).<br>  <br>  The Upanishads call the emotional component of mind as<br>  Chitta and the rational component of mind as Manas. <br>  <br>  Chitta is the component connected with intuition.<br>  Modern psychologists say that passions have the same<br>  limitations of senses as they tend toward immediate<br>  emotional discharge. Chitta is the quick acting<br>  component of the mind which can be termed as leftist or<br>  negative thinking part. It is called negative because<br>  some psychologists felt that it separates the received<br>  information into pieces, contains unintentional and<br>  contradictory ideas, and lacks internal organisation,<br>  inner consistency, and concrete solutions. On the<br>  contrary, some philosophers thought that this is the<br>  'idealistic view' of thinking about a problem. Chitta<br>  is connected with instincts, urges, impulses, desires,<br>  emotion, imagination, sentiments, passions, caring,<br>  pleasure, exploration, unconventional ideas, moods,<br>  insight, superstitions, immodesty, immorality, analysis<br>  of details, concern about particular features, capacity<br>  to find novel relationships, unrestrained expressions<br>  connected with body or mind, molding of past<br>  experiences into new constellations of meanings,<br>  creation of artistic, poetic and musical works and the<br>  like. Seeing a good work of painting or listening to<br>  music of one's liking will set waves of emotion in<br>  Chitta. It helps us to imagine things in new ways. It<br>  is known that lighter side of life like fun may contain<br>  silly and ridiculous situations. An artist is said to<br>  go to the extremes to divorce himself from<br>  environmental constraints. <br>  <br>  Music transcends the limitations of emotional mind and<br>  rational mind.<br>  <br>  Some modern western musicians wrote that music is a<br>  higher revelation than wisdom and philosophy. Ancient<br>  Hindu texts wrote that music transcends all limitations<br>  of language and races. It is known to many of us that<br>  babies, animals and even snakes enjoy listening to<br>  music.<br>  <br>  One Sloka says the same:<br>  "Sisur vetti pasur vetti, vetti gaana rasam phanihi"<br>  <br>  Ancient Indian texts say that even a foetus in the womb<br>  can enjoy the music.<br>  <br>  Poets described that soft music moves the chord within<br>  like a moon beam that tranquillizes the mind, and acts<br>  like an orison.|`|AA11094648	There are definitely things like music that remind me of childhood and can take me back there. Whilst remembering, I think, the feelings and emotions from that moment that you remember, are re-created. <br>  <br>  I believe it's because the stimulus acts as a 'cue' so you can remember the time and those emotions. <br>  <br>  It's well proven that cues are important in memory, and one of the main reasons for forgetting in the long term memory is not that the information isn't there, but that we do not have the correct cues to access it. <br>  <br>  In your example, the enviromental stimulus such as the music, acts as a cue, and the memory it brings forth includes the emotions from that time. <br>  <br>  Emotions are a powerful thing and we off course store emotions we have felt before in our memory, because of how big a part they pay in experiencing life. It's only reasonable that when remembering something, we will recall the emotions along with say physical things such as a place we were in etc.
AA11094648	Twin studies have found some genetic link with being gay, but it's not 100 per cent, like most things! But they have found there are definitely some clear genetic links there, that could predispose someone to being gay, but it isn't a purely genetic thing.<br>  <br>   I think you are missing a catagory, in that there's also the fact it could be your circumstances (not talking obvious things, but small things in upbringing and whilst a child could lead to it) that eventually lead to someone being gay. Most things aren't purely nature or nurture, there's a combination of both.<br>  <br>  I don't think there's any proof that it's a choice, I don't think you can prove something is a choice very well, unless there are no genetic links at all, nor no proof that it's based on experiences and 'nurture'.  <br>  <br>  Being attracted to someone isn't a choice. It has been found that their are many things that influence why we are attracted to certain people. <br>  <br>  We do no try to prove whether it's a choice that you are a attracted to a certain member of the opposite sex (we just take it that it's something beyond your control, which it is), so why would it be a choice if you are attracted to someone of the opposite sex?|`|6f93a6e1d5a725ab42dd2358683daf96aa	Well, the only way I can think to prove that people do not schoose to be gay is that I am gay. I thought it was the worst thing, and, unfortunately, no one had addressed the issue and told me it was okay. For the longest time I was afraid I was some sort of sick freak, but I know better now. I've come to accept it and even enjoy it now. The only think gay, bi, and trans people choose is whether or not to "come out of the closet".|`|AA12380526	Why does anybody care about if being gay is a choice or are people born that way?  I say we are born that way because that's how I feel inside.  The same way straight people feel when they are attracted to the opposite sex is how I feel.   Why would I choose to be gay?  If I was straight, then I would be straight.  It would be stupid of me to choose to be gay, if I was not attracted to men.  If I liked girls then I would date girls.  <br>  <br>  Also,  seeing as how gay people are disliked,  why would anybody choose to be gay if they were not?  <br>  <br>  Why can't people accept that homosexuality is another way of being?  If you are not, that's okay, but if you are, then that's just how it is.  No big deal.  We can all co-exist together peacefully.  We have been doing it anyway, but the heteros feel threatened for some reason.

WaIK8WL2aa	If you are in tune with yourself and the way you reason through day to day life dealing with their intuitions would be nothing different than a routine.

For example, if your intuition tells you that a 99 year old woman just scaled a twenty story building, you can probably write that off to something that you ate that you shouldn't have.  <br>  <br>  Then, if the logic is okay, you might want to look at the risk of following your intuition.  If your intuition tells you to sink a lot of money into a stock and you can't afford to loose it, you might want to not do it.  <br>  <br>  You might want to switch the logic and risk things around.  <br>  <br>  The one thing I will point out, is that if your gut feeling is that something is dangerous, it probably is, logical or not.<br>  <br>  You can help develop your intuition, I'm told, by guessing which elevator will come first and remembering how you felt when you guessed the times you were right... Things like that.<br>  Good luck.|`|osGefphraa	Well when you feel like there's a cop around the next bend in the road or over the next hill and everytime you feel that way it comes true then give yourself a big pat on the back.

Agarro mi celular y descubro q me habian cortado el servicio... m puse como loca, porq es necesario para mi trabajo; descubri q no habia llegado la factura. Me voy a la oficina mas cercana a mi casa, hago una cola de 2 hs y media y me dicen q de ahi no m lo pueden solucionar, q el sistema no andaba. Lo q podia hacer era ir ma?ana a abonar el mismo importe q el mes anterior. <br>  Salgo de ahi,con toda la bronca encima, me voy hasta la parada, a la 2a cuadra se me rompe la ojota caminando, me queme todo el pie, estuve 45 min en la parada ty el bondi nunca paso. A todo esto yo e,pece a caminar con un pie descalso para buscar una remiseria, cam,ine alrededor de 6 cuadras y preguntando encuentro una. La estupida de la recepcionista m dice q solo trabajaban con codigo ?? le explique q iba ahi nomas, a 15 cuadras, y parece q dudo. Segui preguntando (a todo esto hasta se me habia pegadoo un chiclen en la planta del pie, y me quemaba como si estuviera pisando brasas). lLlego a otra remiseria, me deja en mi casa, y yo ya estaba agradeciendo a Dios... si me pedia $100 te juro q se los daba. Pero no termino ahi, al cerrar la puerta del auto, esta cierra mal. La abro para un nuevo intento y al cerrer me quedo el dedo gordo... empezo a sangrar y a la semana perdi la u?a.<br>  <br>  Y bueno... dicen q hay cosas peores, pero mi vida esta signada por la mala suerte, motivo por el cual no creo en la suerte.<br>  <br>  Besos y fue muy aliviante contarte todo esto.<br>  <br>  Gracias|`|O1ads6craa	Tuve muchos dias malos en mi vida, pero el peor dia fue cuando perdi al gran amor de mi vida.|`|6ceefbc61b18699842cc956595344493aa	supongo que fue cuando fallecio mi abuela paterna.  ella era maravillosa conmigo; me adoraba. no hay dia que no la recuerde.<br>  saludos.|`|I3IpQMEVaa	tuve muchas días feos(muertes de familiares,perdidas afectivas)pero te cuento el mas patético que me dejo con dolor de cabeza por un par de días.Se enferma mi suegro,lo internan,muere.hasta allí,un drama familiar como cualquiera.mi cu?ada(un ser siniestro)que no tiene un peso se ocupo de los tramites de cocheria,elegir cajón,y todos esas cosas porque mi buen compa?ero estaba bajo de defensas y puso a dispocicion su tarjeta(que también pago yo)allí nomas cuando me percate empecé a discutir y achicar gastos a la mitad(cajón intermedio,no el mejor,un solo auto para la viuda,una corona y no dos,etc)porque creo que los muertos no ven nada y es plata tirada.al momento de cerrar el cajón,con toda la familia y relaciones en la cocheria mi cu?ada(que se llevaba para la miércoles con el padre y hasta llego a robarle)se abrazo del cajón a los gritos y cuando querían sacarla empezó a los golpes.mi suegra se descompuso,yo aproveche para meterle un cachetazo y muchos se reían porque la conocen (patético)mi negro quedo tan mal que durante 2 días estuvo descompuesto.ese día no me lo olvido massss.chaucito|`|MPfuIEpqaa	En mi vida no hay peores dias, hay peores meses...<br>  saludos...|`|gN1uq0Cmaa	Unico y desastroso|`|wqcbmNSmaa	El peor dia de mi vida fue el 26 de mayo del 2006, a las 9:30pm. Me dirigia a un night club al que siepre asisto venia de un lugar llamado Hooters en el cual estube tomando unas cervesas con mi cuate y unas amigas. Recibi una llamada de otra amiga para citarnos en el antro. Por estupido acepte ir sin esperar a que se me bajara un poco. Tome el volante y desapues de un rato de manejar, choque mi auto a 125m/h  que equivale 200k/h. Afortunadamente nadie salio herido pues logre evitar los demas autos. Rato despues me arrestaron y me llevaron detenido. Me quede sin auto, me ficharon como chofer borracho, y ahora durante 3 a?os no me puedo meter en problemas con la ley ya que de lo contrario me encerarian por un mes. Ese fue mi peor dia.|`|0cEY4yEoaa	uyy, he tenido varios, cuando fallecio mi hermano menor, cuando por primera vez vi que le dio un ataque, a mi esposo, porque el toma mucho, y esos dias habia dejado de tomar, y segun el doctor le bajo la glucosa, lo lleve de inmediato al issttte, ahi, le volvieron a dar otros dos ataques, es horrible, se le van los ojos, queda tieso completamente, poco a poco me he ido acostumbrando a esto, y ya no corro al issttte, yo lo atiendo, tratando de que no se muerda la lengua, en fin es tremendo una situacion asi, y sabiendo que no tiene remedio, porque lo he buscado , y no la he encontrado, yo creo que es lo peor que me ha sucedido en la vida, casarme con un alcoholico, y tener que seguir viviendo a su lado, sin poder ayudarlo, ya que todo lo que haga esta de mas, centros de rehabilitacion, medicina, cuidados, en fin no se lo deseo a nadie, por eso les pido a todos por favor, que no tomen mucho, que cuiden su vida, porque hacen sufrir mucho a su familia, y cuando se casan, a su esposa e hijos, psicologicamente todos estamos afectados, al grado que tenemos que estar yendo a psicologos, y estar en tratamiento, en fin tambien, cuando mi ni?a se me enfermo y la tuve que internar, que se me deshidrato, y desnutrio, porque no queria tomar leche, en fin que uno como madre, esposa, pasa mil vicisitudes en la vida, para sacar adelante a su familia, que dios los bendiga, y cuidense mucho, para que no sufran, antes de casarse, lean libros, de como cuidar a los ni?os, como hay que alimentarlos, fijense bien con quien se casan, si ven que tiene alguna adiccion, mas vale que los dejen, antes que sea demasiado tarde.

XrZj7Qgoaa	Hola!<br>  Dicen esto, personas generalmente de mas experiencia, por que el compromiso de tener un hijo y una familia es muy grande y, normalmente, los involucrados (padres) ya no tienen tiempo para hacer ninguna otra cosa que enfocarse en el bienestar economico, crecimiento, cuidado y educacion des sus hijos.<br>  Asi es, el matrimonio y un hijo o los que sean, conllevan la responsabilidad de mantenerlos, cudarlos, educarlos y un sinfin de cosas mas, lo que hace que todo el enfoque, trabajo y esfuerzos de los padres se dirijan hacia alli.<br>  Esto termina con la vida social de los padres, viajes que quisieran hacer, tiempo libre que quisieran tener despues del trabajo y, normalmente con toda actividad que se enfoque hacia ellos, hobbies, diversiones etc, etc.<br>  Esto por la situacion economica, no es facil sacar adelante un hjo o una familia, deben trabajar muchisimo. Los padres o con mas razon la madre soltera, no tendran vida para ellos.<br>  A veces esto provoca que los que no conocieron los lugares que querian, o llevaron al cabo algunos de sus  deseos o suenyos, se sientan mal, que sientan que les "Falto" que no son totalmente felices, y a veces provoca esto los rompimientos de la pareja y general infelicidad.<br>  Solo la gente muy rica puede hacer esto de tener famila y no sufir por los ingresos o cargas de trabajo, pueden gastar en lo que quieran y habra quien cuide a los hijos cuando ellos deseen teimpo para paseo.<br>  Es por eso que se recomienda que las personas lo piensen mucho antes de casarse o tener familia tan jovenes, no es un mal deseo, simplemente es la experiencia de los mayores.<br>  Ahora bien, hay muchos que se casan jovenes y su matrimonio es excelente, no se arrepienten ni sienten que se perdieron de nada, puede pasarte eso a ti, no tiene por que ser lo que dicen los demas, lo que ocurre es que si pasa esto en muchos casos y te da el consejo no es una critica.<br>  No eres la unica, mi mama se caso a los 19 anyos y fue feliz, aqui lo que te puedo decir es que fue hace 40 anyos y las cosas eran muy diferentes, el sueldo de mi padre alcanzaba para vivir bien, tal vez por eso.<br>  Es solo una opinion.<br>  Saludos y suerte!|`|j7Ttvr5xaa	Cuando yo tenia 16 sentía haber vivido mucho, porque había pasados por cosas (no todas agradables) que mucha gente mayor ni siquiera imaginaba y si me hicieron madurar, aun así era un escuincle, la percepción que tenemos de nosotros mismos no es la misma que tiene la demás gente, un ejemplo: los ni?os digamos entre 4 y 8 a?os que quieren crecer o ser adultos pronto creen tener capacidades mayores a lo que realmente tienen, seguro alguna vez has visto que un peque?o quiere ayudar a su mamá por ejemplo a planchar la ropa, la mamá le dice que todavía no puede, que es peque?o pero él insiste, qué pasa si la mamá lo deja planchar, se va a poner una quemada que puede ir desde algo leve, hasta una tragedia. Cuando el ni?o madure psicológicamente, sabrá que físicamente todavía tiene limitaciones, pero esta en proceso de madurar, nadie más que tú sabes cuando eres totalmente madura o qué cosas te son posibles en este momento y si te equivocas nadie más que tú tendrá que cargar con las consecuencias y encontrar las soluciones. yo ahora tengo 29 tal vez me case antes de que termine este a?o, ya soy lo suficientemente maduro para eso, pero no he alcanzado mi madurez total,( todos tenemos diferentes niveles y algunos la alcanzan muy jóvenes) yo sigo madurando cada día, en qué nivel estas tú?... suerte, saludos!!|`|o47aKTXHaa	si piensas tener un hijo ya de debes de tener en claro lo que es eso <br>  Mucha responsabilidad<br>  tu piensas que ya viviste pero auque no lo creas te falta mucho<br>  una conocida que tengo tiene 28 a?os y no se a casado ni tiene hijos y ella dice que esta muy agusto asi    PIENSALO|`|wqcbmNSmaa	Tu eres due?a de tu vida y pudes hacer y desacer lo que quieras con ella y que no te importe lo que digan los demas, que ellos no te mantendran a ti ni a tus hijos.<br>  <br>  Suerte y besos.|`|a05cef0f8d79b4841f642b55bd07fcf1aa	pq cuando estamos (y estoy tngo 21), en la juventud sentimos tener las 3 í es...<br>  <br>  I - nmortalidad<br>  I - nteligencia<br>  e I - nfertilidad<br>  <br>  cosa q con unos a?os mas y al entrar en la verdadera sociedad te das cuenta de q no es asi, consecuentemente es cuando estas mejor preparada tras unos fregadazos de la vida tanto mental como economicamente... (adquieres estabilidad y dejas un poco de lado la espontaneidad, de la cual muchas veces nos arrepentimos)|`|7a9351dbc0e85eb5b2270aefb498353daa	Creo que uno tiene que ser sincero, primero el deseo de tener un hijo se basa en una relacion verdadera con la pareja, es muy egoista pensar que yo ahora quiero tener un hijo y ni mencionas si estas enamorada o con una relacion consolidada. <br>  Uno debe afrontar lo que viene, y tener un hijo y criarlo es duro, no es todo color de rosa.<br>  Si uno tiene una profesion y "disfruto de sus etapas" todo es mas facil, no tenes proeblemas economicos, viviste lo que tenias que vivir, a veces la vida te presenta no un hombre sino varios hasta que descubres que es él, tu hombre.<br>  Y luego no te arrepientes de nada, no le echas la culpa a nadie y no sales a vivir una vida que no viviste. Me refiero a mujeres que se casaron muy jovenes,  y despues de grandes se comportan como si tuvieran 18 a?os. Y lo peor que se dan cuenta que se casaron muy jovenes...y como dicen no disfrutaron.<br>  Es tu eleccion y vos sos la que decidis tu futuro

61X3669paa	1o Madurar es aprender de los errores cometidos<br>  2o Soportar la ilusion que nuestros sue?os diluyen el la realidad...mmm... Seguir la experiencia ultima... Resistir a nuestras quejas eternas... oir sin escuchar, desde el fondo de nosotros, la palpitacion de una vida deseada que nunca sera. Volver a encontrar el deseo de ver y de escuchar. Aprender a vivir con intenciones fabulosas... sin esperanza alguna.<br>  3o sino es aprender a su sufrir con cada dìa y cada persona, pues seria una fantasia el vivir, madurar a mi parecer es aprender a existir en este mundo ya creado sin consulta, empesado sin final y continuo una vez màs sin preguntar a nadie, simplemente el tiempo pasara y de ti depende el saber entender que tienes que vivir contra tiempo y disfrutar cada segundo tratando de hacer feliz a los demas sin descuidar tu persona... madurar se logra con el deseo de vivr de verdad y contra todo....<br>  4o aprender a privar todo aquello que nace de nosotros que sabemos que no cabe en este lugar, en estas reglas, con las que vivimos.<br>  Madurar .... matar parte de nosotros...<br>  5o es no estar en indesiciones, el caminar sabiendo lo que haces, el dejar de pensar en nubes de papel mientras el obnibus hace su ruta, madurar es hacerse responsable de cada diminuta palabra y pensamiento salgan por tu cabeza<br>  <br>  todo esto es madurar! besos y saludos!|`|3ChJ8cJKaa	Es relativo algunas personas se hacen mayores y no han madurado y hay jóvenes que son responsables y adultos en edades muy tempranas.|`|7Idiyrecaa	Cuando te conformas con tu vida y tu suerte.

9be6374e78d68c69f3c0e6a68f547775aa	Yes, anything done to excess can be done to a fault. To excess, humility leads to people who can't accept thanks gracefully because, after all, they don't want thanks. They want to be givers and not ever receive kindness. They belittle their accomplishments and own self-worth because they take humility to extreme.|`|e88862626d5369dd487c7f4e8374547faa	Yes, there is a fine line there that sometimes may be inadvertently crossed.<br>  <br>  However, a tendency toward humility is best.<br>  <br>  The continual thumping of ones own chest is not a good alternative.

iGWnzykEaa	Means the consumer has maximized his budget totally.  This has three main variables.  Income, Utility, and indifference.  <br>  Income:  Total Household income.<br>  Utility:  Bills you must pay.  example:  electric, food, gas<br>  Indifference:  Things you want. golf clubs, clothes, movie<br>  <br>  There are many models on the net to show how price, income, consumption, etc., can change your consumer optimum.  The idea being to increase your indifference level by lowering your utility or increasing your income.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps, it is the basic version.|`|2ITUb72Paa	In economics, consumer ptimum is defined as the particular allocation of the consumers income budgetted for expenditure in a given period among various items of consumption, that would maximize the satisfaction or the utility of the consumer. In other words, any change from the optimum allocation of household budget to increase the consumption of one item at the expense of another item would lead to a fall in the satisfaction or utility of the consumers. Optimum allocation gives the greatest satisfaction. Clearly, the optimum will vary from consumer to consumer depending on the tastes and preferences, the income limit and the prices of different consumer goods.
BJvs6B1Raa	the above is correct produce where mr = mc. <br>  At that Q move up to the demand curve and charge that price. All goods brought to the market are sold at that price.|`|26b58f090f3edfbdd055b095807c5833aa	They'll produce to where MR = MC just like perfect competition, but price will be higher than this.  In other words, in perfect competition, MR = MC = p; but in the monopoly p > MR.<br>  <br>  In perfect competition, the demand curve = marginal revenue curve.<br>  <br>  But in a monopoly the marginal revenue curve is steeper (twice as steep, actually) than in perfect competition - that causes the firm to produce a smaller Q at a higher price.<br>  <br>  It is easier to show graphically.

1bb71e635a87f9c2d8220d95e3475ff6aa	Ironically, my mother (as we speak) is graduating from ICF.  She is a life coach...not relationship coach—although she is a clinical psychologist.<br>  <br>  From what I understand...she went to California on four different occasions, each time taking one 40-hour class.  I believe the cost was $1,000 per class.<br>  <br>  In between classes, she did 75 hours of pro bono coaching and 50 hours of paid coaching.  She found most of her clients by word of mouth.  She also spoke with her assigned mentor on the phone for one hour, every other week.  The cost of the mentor was $80 per session.<br>  <br>  The most important thing in a coaching course is that it’s accredited.  The website below only offers accredited courses.

However, nowadays both genders are equal, but it is believed that girls are better academically as they put the effort in and are competitive in school work. On the other hand, boys are more competitive with sport, so they place their efforts in soccer etc. Overall, at the end of the day it depends on the idividual and what their interests are-despite their gender  as you may find an individual who is amazing at sport and general knowledge, but can't cook. Or a person who can cook , but can't perform sport with each gender :).

QxoycSjvaa	My friend Mark has the funniest embarrassing stories.<br>  <br>  He was in the front row at church and everyone was standing during worship and his pants just dropped to his ankles and he wasn't wearing any underwear!  He quickly pulled em up and was so embarrassed he tried to dart out this small side door at the front of the room but it turned out to be locked and he had just banged on it really loud by pushing into it full force.  Everyone looked at him up in front like that so he had to walk by everyone staring at him to the rear exit...<br>  <br>  Another one that happened to him was he was driving this go cart on this track and he got distracted and drove off to the side and got stuck.  After the guy came and pushed the cart back onto the track and left again, Mark looked down and saw his balls hanging out of these really short shorts he had on...<br>  <br>  Sooooooooooooooooooooooo funny.  When he tells those stories he laughs so hard and gets so embarrassed but he thinks it's funny he doesn't take it so deadly serious.<br>  <br>  Another one he likes to tell is when he was driving a 64 chevy he was waiting to turn right out of this parking lot onto this busy street for a long time because traffic was so steady.  Well he finally saw a brief opening so he gunned it with the wheel cranked to the right and because it didn't have power steering he couldn't adjust fast enough to correct the turn and go straight.  He kept turning right and plowed up onto the curb and took out a wooden street sign that landed on his hood.  He ended up fully on the sidewalk.  The security guard came over, asked if he was okay then told him not to worry about and just to take off so he did- in front of several onlookers.<br>  <br>  I guess you just have to know him.  He's the first to admit he's not the sharpest tack in the box but he has such a good sense of humour about it.|`|5a5gAVhNaa	This really did happen...I had about 25 witnesses...<br>  <br>  I was in 7th or 8th grade, and I was getting off the school bus at a friend's house for her birthday party.  I was wearing a navy blue hoodie jacket, and I was the last person to get off the bus.  Just as the doors were closing behind me, and I was starting to walk away, I noticed something tugging at my jacket.  Mind you, this was a brand new jacket that I bought with my own hard earned money (seriously) and I was very proud of it.  Anyway, I turned around and saw that the string from the hood had gotten wrapped around the rearview mirror of the bus, and then the bus started to drive away...<br>  <br>  I started to walk along with the bus trying to get the string untangled from the mirror, but as the bus started to speed up- it pulled the hood tight to my head.  You know how if you pull the strings tight on a hoodie, you basically get one little hole to look out of because the whole thing covers your face?  Well, that happened to me...and finally the string just ripped out of the jacket all together, and I fell on the ground.<br>  <br>  Mind you, as all this was happening- the couple of kids that were still on the bus didn't even try to get the bus driver to stop- because they were all laughing so hard.  Not to mention that I was the talk of the birthday party...|`|642bc3242492fab9c16acba95d42847baa	i was dancing in church and my skirt dropped  to my mid thigh and everyone could see what was under it.

fvcO8iwIaa	mira Victoria, tengo un amigo gay, que una vez de tanto joder a calentar a uan amiga terminaron en la cama, el se exito y la paso segun el medianamente bien (esta chica sabe hacer bien las cosas). Pero siguiò un tiempo, la chica le empezo a gustar cada vez màs el chico hasta que un dìa este la dejo y volvio a ser una loca como siempre. Ser gay es una elecciòn de que sexualidad queres tener, eso no quiere decir que alguna vez prueve otra cosa, pero le siguen gustando los hombres. Si queres segui intentando y por ahì logras convencerlo para sacarte las ganas, pero no creo que mas que eso. Si no busca otro chico, que seguramente tenes con que, ya que casi siempre las amigas de los chicos gay estan re fuertes. besos|`|w5X3Zn5Iaa	Soy mujer pero me gusto tu pregunta y me parece bien que pruebes con tu amigo a ver si le gusta o no jaja!!

No es una cuestion de elegir lo que te va a gustar y lo que no, es mucho mas complejo y en algunos casos hay que remontarse a la primera infancia para saber el porqué de la atraccion hacia el mismo sexo. <br>  Con respecto a tu amigo, no hace falta ser amanerado para ser homosexual. ?l debe ser lo que se llama "gay activo", es masculino pero se siente atraido por hombres que por alguna característica (tono de voz, aspecto, rasgos, modo de caminar, etc. ) le recuerden inconcientemente a la mujer. Y no todo depende de lo que la mente ordene, en éso estas equivocada. Si una mujer lo estimula a lo sumo puede excitarse peo solo como respuesta al estímulo, pero enamorarse, no se va a enamorar.|`|0620cf6cf6483fa05d1441ae5edb7d4aaa	OPINO QUE TU AMIGO GAY , YA DECIDIO LO QUIERE Y LO HACE FELIZ, YA TIENE DETERMINADA SU VIDA SEXUAL ,Y LO FELECITO , PORQUE TU QUIERES VIOLARLO??(..LA PALABRA"VIOLAR "ES ALGO FORZADO) Y NADA LINDO, PARA LA PERSONA QUE ES ABUSADA , ES LO MISMO QUE A TI , NO TE GUSTARAN LAS MUJERES,Y TE " ACOSARAN , PARA TENER SEXO" , NO TE GUSTARIA NO?? ..NO ESTOY DE ACUERDO CONTIGO ,( ACEPTALO COMO GAY, QUE ES)Y LO BUENO ES QUE SALIO DEL CLOSET , ESO ME ALEGRA A MI !!!!

NvHM67Szaa	Let's say the VAT was 50 %.  VAT takes a $100 item to $150, a $50 increase<br>  <br>  Now, the shop's price reduction is the amount of VAT -- $50.  Reducing a $150 item to $100 means a 33 and 1/3 % decrease.<br>  <br>  The thing to realize is that the original $50 increase was on a SMALLER base ($100) then the the $50 decrease (from a base of $150).  This makes the percentage increase GREATER. |`|R2BhLUEWaa	If an item cost ￡1 before VAT, then after VAT the item would cost ￡1.17.5<br>  <br>  so the sale price depends on the detail of the offer:  <br>  <br>  If it is to reduce the post vat price by 17.5% then I think (and I'm no expert) that the final sale price would be ￡96.94 (117.5 - 17.5%)<br>  <br>  However, if the sale was to reduce the price (not percentage) by the amount of VAT that had previously been included then the cost would go from ￡117.5 to ￡1.00 - a percentage reduction I think of around 14.89%<br>  <br>  but this could be the beer talking ;)|`|IU6jtoSgaa	To remove the 17.5% VAT element, the calculation is not to simply take the order total and deduct 17.5%. For example, if your order (excluding VAT) was for 100, 100 plus 17.5% VAT makes a grand total of 117.50. If you now deduct 17.5% from 117.50, the answer will be 96.94, not the correct starting figure of 100. The correct calculation to remove VAT, is to divide the grand total (117.50) by 47, then multiply the result by 7 and subtract the result (17.50) from the grand total (117.50). This equals the correct starting amount (100). As you can see, this equates to a deduction of around 14.893%, |`|UCqsoYUlaa	yea it would be if the VAT is all thats being taken with a basic question. So the 17.5 should be correct.|`|JPhWfFNWaa	Actually I believe you are correct|`|xrSWqTMYaa	are you in charge of uk banks by anychance<br>  WTF !!<br>  |`|s2TJ6H1raa	yes|`|hW0oNfAvaa	no as 17.5% of the total is more than 17.5% of the item if that makes sense

AA10042782	Most likely, it was reproductive isolation and natural selection that selected for the traits for classic Neandertals in Europe to survive.<br>  There was divergence more than 300,000 years before present, and the isolation was due to geography and climate.  Ice ages cut these people off from the other archaic modern humans, and there was no gene flow between the two groups.<br>  <br>  However, in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, these two groups did have contact.  There, they have the same stone tool technology that our ancestors had, called Mousterian technology.  The "eastern Neandertals" do not nicely fit into the "classic Neandertal" motif so nicely.  They have shared anatomical characteristics with archaic modern humans, our ancestors.<br>  <br>  Cheers|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	I can't tell for sure from your question, but you seem to be under the impression that Neanderthals were our ancestors.

Neanderthals evolved in much harsher climates which is why they have a much stockier and massive build than humans.  evidence of this comes from humans and neanderthals living in during human existence and in many of the same sites.  although they occupied similar areas they were never there at the same time.  the time period of their existence is so vast that there were many periods of glaciation and as this happened humans moved south and neanderthals moved in as it got colder.  their divergence was due to neanderthals adapting to the cold and humans simply moving away.|`|6YbxTlDCaa	environment + mutation +isolation...somewhere along the human family tree, there was a split, as you say... humans did a lot of traveling and distances between living groups/populations, can and do result in physical differences if allowed to carry on for enough time and if the distances are great and environments are diverse enough.

joVFYmhOaa	Could just be a reflection of what is going on in your life at the moment. Sounds like things could be a bit unsettled for you and maybe somewhat out of control.  You are not sure what the future holds but you are concerned that it could be not so good.  You are not feeling like you have much control over things because you dialed 911 but the phone broke. Seeems like you are feeling that 'everyone' is against you right now.  <br>  Dont worrry....it will all pass.

Its like your day is a song and your brain is making and effed up re-mix. You think that you could have never thought about guys trying to kill you with bats but look deep into all the back thoughts you had and might have thought about that, and thouight about going to lowes (even if you didnt connect the twoo). In my experience dreams can also be premonitions or an exageration of your fears mainfested in a sleeping story line. dont get too worried though cause the likelyhood that, this will happen to you isnt very large.  Think about it, im sure you can answer your own question

XVWuAvG1aa	No, not me. I don't know someone who falls in this category either. |`|b9bDUusKaa	I can see how it might help someone who has some trauma to get over. It might be a good therapy. But for the average joe or jane, I can't imagine anyone giving away their freedom to ****.|`|BXhBKD0Qaa	If you do it with somebody and it feels like the first time, then yes. Or if your previous experience(s) were so miserable that they dont even count. Or if you tried something new? There are many ways to feel like a virgin, one of them is to actually restore your hymen, or in feminists case, put a zipper.|`|ieo61ZTFaa	I have never heard of this.  You can decide to not have sex until you are married (call it what you will) but once you have had sexual intercourse, you are no longer a virgin.  <br>  <br>  PLEASE do not place so much importance on "virginity".   The very idea that it makes you more "valuable" as a woman is the product of an ancient culture of sexism meant to demoralize women.  Women have as much right as men to have a healthy sex life.  But do what feels right for you!   Above all...be safe!!|`|R3hC5Gtyaa	You cant physically be born a virgin anymore, the term "being born a virgin" means changing your sexual habits, but once you have sexual intercourse once, your no longer a virgin. |`|IjSVNOZraa	For reals, I just read about this the other day.<br>  <br>  No, I am not, nor have I ever met anyone to claim to be one.... then again, I don't really hang out with people that talk about their virginity (or lack thereof) 24/7... those people annoy me.<br>  <br>  lol|`|34LkTAi9aa	This is quite an idiotic question.<br>  However, I heard of a shark who got pregnant without having a sexual intercourse. |`|dIcWRG6Daa	i've heard of it... don't know anyone abstaining though :)<br>  <br>  but i think madonna sang a song about it...

Now I've heard everything. <br>  <br>  Seriously I think it's just an excuse for her to use to make her feel better about being a former sex addict. It's all fine and dandy if she wants to stop having sex and wait until she finds a man she loves and marries but really "born again virgin?" That's a load of bs if I've ever heard it. Virginity isn't just a physical thing it's mental as well. Once you loose it you never get it back.|`|w6r4U7duaa	I was.After my first love hurt me badly. I used guys for years. I didnt sleep with them, well maybe a few. I just liked playing with them. Then i stopped. I decided to stay pure for 3 years or so. And then i hesitantly kissed a guy i really liked, i turned into a 12 year old! I didnt know what to do, i felt like it was my first time. Really scary and nervous. What triggered the change was my deep love for my ex, then he hurt me. I then became guarded and saved myself for the next love if that makes sense. The next love i stuffed up cause i was scard he would hurt me too. I gave in to quickly and dumped him too fast then i hurt myself. i then went back to my first love as i discovered i didnt want anyone else lol. hence i discovered that was why i became the borne again virgin after he dumped me.|`|w9cicy0Daa	A proclamation in this case means nothing, virginity is defined by the fact of never having had sex. Like 'being dead' is irreversible.<br>  <br>  Hymen reconstruction or Hymenorrhaphy, is on the increase, in America no less! Apart from suturing a torn hymen in a young girl, I can't imagine who gets this as a total reconstruction and why.|`|Madtpnoxaa	Oh this was from Tyra banks show and not from King of the Hill? There was an episode where Lou anne became a born again virgin and the joke of that. King of the Hill is the **** in my own opinion....so damn funny.|`|2u43QnUsaa	"Born again virgin"?<br>  <br>  Sorry honey - once you lose it, it's gone.|`|TfAxeV3Maa	No. I don't buy into the bs that my worth as a girl/woman is contingent upon an intact hymen|`|AA11179275	ok, what exactly does that mean? please explain it to me |`|o2rIRhkxaa	not me
CEChcfKwaa	These days parents are so over-worked just trying to provide everything their family needs they forget or are too tired to provide companionship and support also. The cost of everything has gone up but the wages haven't so that leaves parents having to work harder for less.<br>  <br>  How can you help?<br>  <br>   Try asking for or expecting less material things. Teenagers especially can be very demanding for the things "everyone else" has. You can also take some of the burden off by helping out around the house without a huge hassle. If you see something needs doing just do it. Don't wait for mom to do it or to tell you to do it. This shows maturity and also that you care about making things easier on your parents.<br>  <br>  It is too easy to get into the me, me, me mindset and forget your parents are people too and can only do so much.<br>  <br>  Also, learn to recognize when your parent is tired or grumpy and don't pick those times to have a big discussion about what they aren't doing right. Pick your battles and battle times wisely or every concern you bring up will be treated like all the petty ones.<br>  <br>  Remember: respect, support and understanding goes both ways.|`|xfZ7R4djaa	I believe it is more than providing food and shelter it is also the love, nurture, and support that makes you a good parent. Some parents <br>  haven't had that in their life so they do not know how to give that to their child.
C2sZREuAaa	Yes, You would need to a large chalk board or maybe a large sheet of paper for this.<br>  <br>  <br>  I would break it up in maybe 4-5 sections.  <br>  <br>  What time of the day does this happen?   ( you may see it happens at a certain time of the day)<br>  <br>  Where does it take place?  (at home, work, on the street)<br>  <br>  Was I with anyone?  (with a friend,  relative, by myself)<br>  <br>  What was the outcome?  (did I hurt myself, did I hurt someone)<br>  <br>  If you see the same pattern happening or a connection.   Then you can kind of see hmmm... this is not good.|`|533aec411376adde47ba86f66a0aa949aa	It depends on a number of things:<br>  <br>  1) How well you are able to think clearly and rationally in the first place.<br>  2) Your ability to find the information (and recognize it as such) that pertains to your particular problem.<br>  3) Your ability to follow through on the conclusions you come up with.<br>  <br>  Since most people can't successfully use psychotherapy on their own  (like most addicts can't quit on their own, since they wouldn't be in support groups if they could,) what you can do is write down all the things that have happened to you, come up with what you think of as the underlying problem (and solutions) and then take your findings to some sort of mental health professional/specialist. In other words, you can probably do the gruntwork by yourself, but you'll probably need someone more versed in the field to fine-tune your conclusions. They might see a pattern you don't, because they've seen more examples of it (while not being a part of it, and thus blinded, like not seeing the forest for the tree in front of you) and thus are able to go 'I see what you mean, but this also might be affecting you as well.'<br>  <br>  Even doctors go to other doctors when they are sick, and therapists sometimes need to see therapists to help them through a crisis they can't get a grasp on. Independent eyes and mind are almost always needed in the process, somewhere along the line.|`|fNZVytg8aa	If you are able to do it and are able to look at it constructively then doing it yourself would probably achieve much higher success than any psychologist. Only you know the workings of your brain, afterall
AwrtwIpIaa	Trust your inner voice.|`|6CAsx3jaaa	 its time to do some inner reflection. you difine weakness in terms of physicality byt say your not weak. there are all kinds of weaknesses . i think you identified yours . its insecurity and that is all mental. voices in your head arent always your enemy sometimes they warn you. go to the minister who would perform the ceremony and discuss your fears. let me give you some questions to start you off. does your wife have any responsibilty in protecting herself? what does protection mean?  is your insecurity really about fear of losing them?  what other messages have you gotten from that same voice ?  do you have a good voice and bad voice in your head?|`|AA12234654	Yes, we do, most of us anyway, I have listed a website that someone sent me called the daily Om and it spoke about just this subject, I think you should check it out, I think it is still the daily one, it was called your inner voice, I thought it was quite interesting.<br>  Good luck!|`|Mug9SQjWaa	Smoking Joe.<br>  <br>  1. You get married because you know it's what you want.<br>  2. Marriage takes a lot of hard work to work.<br>  3. Nobody says you got to do all the protecting.<br>  4. Hell - marriage is fun - if it ain't it ain't working.<br>  5. I was real scared the first time I got on a bike, but boy did it turn out to be fun.<br>  <br>  Stop condemning yourself - you are your worst enemy - believe me. Just give it up, tell that miserable voice to go to helll and just give life everything you got.<br>  <br>  You can't win the race if you are not running in the race.|`|qTVkydt1aa	Tell it to shut it because you're strong and could protect your wife and family and your wife could protect herself and you as well.  You can protect each other.<br>  <br>  Yes, we all have inner voices.  Basic human needs.<br>  <br>  Schizophrenia and having basic thoughts of doubt are two COMPLETELY different things.|`|oe3ng5Ghaa	well ur inner voices are just messin with u ive had something like that happened to me so just distract urself and think positive harder and if u know that ur not weak go with that even though u have those inner voices ur wife could take care of herself and u and ur family and so can u if u think u can dont mess up ur relationship just cuz of those inner voices its also cuz ur nervous scared and all |`|8tIXayuJaa	That seems like a minor case of schizophrenia. Maybe you should get some medicine to control these thoughts.
OLpWRv2uaa	Sounds like you are as messed up as I am.. I take klonopin and Cymbalta to help me forget about the millions of people who are looking and talking about me on a daily basis. |`|jLMyGR9oaa	Maybe you need an anxiety medicine?

w2GG8Z99aa	"I hear...I forget<br>  I see...and I remember<br>  I do...and I understand"<br>  Ancient Chinese Proverb<br>  <br>  This applies to teaching somebody something. It means that if you simply tell (or talk) about something to a person/people, it is very likely that they will forget what was said. If you tell them *and* show them, they will more likely remember what was taught. If you involve them in a 'hands-on' activity/manner (where they 'do' what you are trying to teach them), they will fully understand- which means they will have totally "learned" whatever was being taught.<br>  |`|K0PNbcjYaa	wow that is too deep beyond my knowledge.<br>  lol good luck.<br>  ill keep thinking about it though.<br>  <br>  it may have something to do with humans.<br>  we notice things, but make room for more, thus forgetting, but once reminded of it we can trace it back in our minds, and with the human mind, we grow and percive things as we go on about life, like doing and observing things and then undrstanding the concepts of what we do.|`|3b79f49b0ba5db95356ea6c9d23f596caa	it means the learner gains knowledge from reading and doing ..... ie not able to learn from just listening to a lecture|`|d991366e539664f927a671333175080eaa	I believe it was Confucious who said,<br>  "what I hear I forget, but what I see I remember"<br>  <br>  Basically what it means is that you refuse to form an opinion of some else according to what you've heard, but will form your own opinion when you actually see that person yourself.  Too many people form opinions of others by what they've been told from others instead of just meeting the person and then forming their opinion.  <br>  This is actually one of my most favorite sayings!

Hearing is a passive thing. It is different from listening, which is active. You may hear someone yelling at you when youre driving your car, but you'll forget it when you get to the office. But if you're listening attentively to what he's yelling, you'll sure to remember it. You may hear your mom yelling at you but I doubt if you're listening to what she's saying--you'll forget it the moment you turn off the TV.<br>  <br>  2. You remember memories when you see objects or images associated to it. Just like a photo album or a memory chest. When you see your picture when you were still in third grade, you'll remember the kid who bullies you. Or your first fight. Or your stinking sandwich inside your colorful lunchbox. Or the playground where you scratched your knee. Or your teacher who happens to be your silly crush. <br>  <br>  3. It's hard to understand how it is to play jazz music unless you're a musician. It's hard for you to understand the value of money unless you're working to put food on the table. Or if you're the one paying you're credit card bills and mortgages. Or to make it more universal, It's hard for you to understand your parents until you raise your own sons and daughters.

9J1IZ40Eaa	Sabes yo pienso exactamente como vos, ese es mi  dilema de mucho tiempo.<br>  Quienes se suicidan son cobardes porque no afrontar su realidad, pero al mismo tiempo valientes por haberse quitado la vida sin saber lo que viene despues.<br>  Sin embargo quedan los que no lo hacen son valientes porque deciden enfrentas la vida, pero cabardes por no tener el valor matarse.<br>  Al final ya no se si sea un asunto de valor o cobardia, despues de saber de tantas personas que han optado por el suicidio, creo que es porque una persona ya no siente nada, no se siente ni cobarde ni con valor de hacer nada, tanto asi que da lo mismo vivir o morir, porque si te mueres por lo menos te enteras que hay despues, en cambio si se sigue viviendo asi, al final es solo como morir.

Pjm9pg7iaa	In the old days a local bank loaned you money to buy your house. You met the banker and got the money. The bank received your payments for the next 30 years.  It worked great but there was only a little money to lend in every city.<br>  The Federal National Mortgage Corporation and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation were created.  They bought the loan from the local bank. They paid the local bank $10 per loan per month to collect the payments and send them on to FNMA and FHLMC.  I asked a local banker why they went to all that trouble for $10.  He said that he had 10,000 mortgages and each paid $10 per month. It was almost all profit. They only had to put a stamp on the payment letter and mail it to FNMA. So the bank made a profit.<br>  FNMA would take the millions of mortgages and put them in bundles of 50 or 100.  Those bundles were sold as investments. Every month when the homeowners made their payments, the money was distributed among the investors who bought the FNMA bonds. The interest on the loans was 6%.  FNMA paid the investors 5% and kept 1% as their profit.  THe investors liked the 5% interest rate.  In 2003 a regular bank savings account paid only 1%.<br>  It all worked fine.  <br>  Until the time came that thousands of people stopped paying their mortgages.  NO one had ever planned for that to happen.  So no money was coming in.  It all froze up as no new people wanted to "buy mortgages"..|`|AA12117196	Here are good articles about Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_mac" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_mac</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fannie_mae" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fannie_mae</a>|`|AA11816938	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fannie_Mae" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fannie_Mae</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Mac" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Mac</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_takeover_of_Fannie_Mae_and_Freddie_Mac" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_tak...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.nyse.com/about/listed/fnm.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nyse.com/about/listed/fnm.htm...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.nyse.com/about/listed/fre.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nyse.com/about/listed/fre.htm...</a><br>  <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/pr?s=FRE">http://finance.yahoo.com/q/pr?s=FRE</a><br>  <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/pr?s=FNM">http://finance.yahoo.com/q/pr?s=FNM</a>

Nos pasa cuando vamos a elegir un sitio para comer, pues ya vez que nadie le presta atención al sitio que está solo, sino que inmediatamente fijas la vista en el lugar que tienen más gente porque piensas que la comida debe ser buena y seguro que ofrecen un excelente servicio y buen precio.

yhC7aa6faa	I was watching Good Morning America on local Channel 8 (ABC) when Charlie Gibson said it appeared that a "small" plane had accidentally run into the World Trade Center and they had a camera crew in route.<br>  <br>  Then they showed the tower with smoke coming out while we saw a jet passenger aircraft hit the other tower. The sickening feeling then came because it was obvious that that this was not an accident.<br>  <br>  I remained sitting in bed watching in horror as the events developed throughout the day. It was almost unspeakable tragedy at the time and even today, six years later, I remain sad as I thought about that horrible day many times.<br>  <br>  While it was a huge blow to the USA, I realize that what we experienced that one time was something that others around the world have suffered multiple times. We are truly fortunate to live in such a great and powerful country.<br>  <br>  Also, most of us realize that the ones who planned and executed that event six years ago have not quit trying. President Bush deserves a lot of credit by directing various governmental agencies to tighten security. While it is not perfect and even most intelligence officers agree that we will be hit again since the terrorists only have to be lucky once to cause havoc while we must remain ever vigilant without fail to maintain security.<br>  <br>  Since I am not old enough to remember Pearl Harbor, my parents described their feelings as being very much the same at that time. It’s just something you cannot forget as President Franklin Roosevelt proclaimed that to be, “A date which will live in infamy” <br>  <br>  As Ronald Reagan said in a speech given in 1964 that is very applicable today, "You and I have a rendezvous with destiny. We will preserve for our children this, the last best hope of man on earth, or we will sentence them to take the first step into a thousand years of darkness.

They can have different definitions, the definitions simply will never disagree with each other. Therefore you will never become an "OXYMORON", because you will always be correct, in your selection agreements. You will also, be able to count any  number in infinity, as if it is money. (BASE TEN MATHEMATICS=INFININCE)! Therefore money=infinince!<br>  <br>  All single digit numbers are equal tio the definition of the word "A"! All  questions are just rhetorical"attitude categories" for creating subconscious subliminal engrams, and tagging them with an emotional attitude. I know this sounds like delusion, and is delusion, and delusion is healthy, when you are self aware of your own self-created illusions, and thereby know beyond a shadow of a doubt you can trust your delusions, because you programmed your own  subconscious mind, with the  knowledge you would believe from yourself, in your future(s)!<br>  <br>  IDO THIS SO WELL I CAN BUILD DEVICES, WHEREBY I CAN PROGRAM ANYTHING I WANT TO LEARN. <br>  <br>  I have five different systems, by which i train my five senses, myself. I can see time, as an effect of the visual code, i can categorize my feelings  with one, my hearing with another, my olfactory sense, (SENSE OF SMELL), WITH ANOTHER, AND MY SENSE OF TASTE WITH STILL ANOTHER. ALL SYSTEMS INTERACT FREELY WITH ONE ANOTHER, AND THIS INTERACTION IS A SIXTH SYSTEM.<br>  <br>  This sixth system, i call "WILL"! For this sixth system, "WILL"! You see, human coonsciousness, is too slow, to deal with the five senses  consciously, but it can devise systems wherein it can train the subconscious in the faster "SENSUAL"PERCEPTIONS!<br>  <br>  You see, the mind cannot cope with existence,    this is why you cannot control your dreams, even though you are aware of them. However, it does deal well with illusion, and actually requires illusion to support its slower, conscious delusional state. <br>  <br>  For example, your subconscious mind, recognizes about sixty thousand words, but you actually dont use more than 500-1000 in your daily life. Thisis because there is a vast difference in the "SENSUAL PLANE OF THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND (the ego), AND THE CONSCIOUS MIND , (he personality)! <br>  <br>  Now the conscious mind is slow, but easily has the ability to figure out conscious problems, therefore it is used to to  encode  perceptions, and meriotize them into an attitude of value judgement, and tag them with a merit attitude tag.<br>  <br>  The subconscious, as a much faster existence, can read these musically notated attitudes, and therefore recognize more than  the consciousness at any given time. <br>  <br>  Therefore, an infinite array of moods, would be desired.<br>  <br>  The next method to use is to make your senses interact with your mind by using your conscious mind to train your subconscious in "SENSUAL"PERCEPTIONS!  tHIS IS DID WITH ANY DEVICE   WHICH WILL HELP YOU IN YOUR COMMON ENVIRONMENT. <br>  <br>  For you, i would suggest a (YELLOW-TUESDAY_ACTIVISM)  hobby, which will consume, and support  your ego from a single perspective. In your case i suggest "PHOTOGRAPHY"!<br>  <br>  It is not only a mood vehicle, it also carries all seven categories, of environmental  interaction! Spirituality, (sincerity), will be supported because light is infinite, and thereby reinstate the infinite random, of the subconscious perception ability even while it is still being trained in this avenue. It will force you to enumerate mathematically, the costs, of products productions, etc. it will force you to interat with your local environment, this is activism,action, and acting. it will support your educational drive, as you will soon see, di=ue to the multitudinous illusions made possible by light reflection, refraction, and colors, the same refraction, reflection, and colors, will be mathematized into a scientific knowledge by the knowledge needed to adjust your equipment. you will become aware of the scientific principle of calculation, and repetition,  as you learn to calculate the necessary mathematics, for  exposure, contrast, conflict, etc. Your view of your local environment, will force you to view the economics/culture  and  note the interactive  systemizaTUION WITH WHICH EVERYTHING IS LINKED TOGETHER.   Music , should begin with a good shot of a great music store, in your local area! Then  always carry around a heart full of music. the lyrics will come, and it does not matter if they are correct, just sound right.<br>  <br>  This is the seven broadest categories of interactive lifestyling,. I hope this array of emotional oddities, which you experienced in reading this, will show you  how, there is no end to mood, and  what you need iis self-training ability in your own self-awareness.<br>  <br>  "SINCERITY CANNOT BE FAKED",<br>  CHICO.|`|rZAamUHdaa	Well I find that listening to a song that is totally different that what you are feeling (like "Grace Kelly"- Mika) or something like that.

VtAiKvXiaa	when a young child starts to walk ,the mother fears they will fall . as the child grows the mother will prevent the child from falling,physically,mentally and emotionaly. she will care for them when they need her most and provide when they need .and when the child has grown she will fear again that the first steps out of her bond will not hurt her child in any way,and fear that her child stay safe, cared for and loved even after she has gone. mothers do not fear that their child will get hurt for any one reason but try to guide them so that they dont experience hurt. |`|OxxrqzCzaa	I like ALL the answers you got ESPECIALLY from roncj88 & lucy.  I am a Mom of a daughter & I worry that someone will sexually abuse her with all those sexual predators out there.  Where I live you get a lot of those letters that a sexual predator is living in the area.  <br>  <br>  Also, I ALWAYS want my daughter to do her best, to try & try again, I used to tell her this when she was on the monkey bars, just to try again.  But, now that she's in school, in 2nd grade, I fear sometimes that my daughter won't try her hardest and therefore will become unintelligent.  I KNOW she's a VERY smart, intelligent girl.  But sometimes she just doesn't want to study for her many tests, and, although tests is NOT the true sign of intelligence, I just want her to get ahead in life, which starts now.  EVERY mother/parent, I would think, wants their child to do better in life then they have (after all, who's life is perfect?).  I want her to get good grades, go to College right after High School like I did, find out by her own research and through her OWN beliefs what religion she wants to follow & also what she wants to do in life, like for example, what profession she'd like to follow, what would make her happy, then after going to school, working & saving enough money to get her own car & insurance & her own place WITHOUT a man, though I'd want her to also find a nice man to settle down with and eventually marry and have kids with.  I want her to be independent, in other words.  <br>  <br>  Also, my daughter is on the small side/thin, I want her to have confidence in herself, even if others call her names & bully her.  And I hope that she is able to use the karate she is learning in SELF-DEFENSE situations ONLY if necessary.<br>  <br>  A lot of the answers of the others are also concerns of mine as well.  As a mother, you have SO MANY worries anbd concerns for your child.  Also you worry that you're doing the right things as their parent.

UuuR3J3oaa	Because the hunted animal is an uncontrolled and uncontollable 'wild card'. The hunt is a mysterious activity. Will the animals be found? Will they be cornered, trapped, speared? Can we overpower them? Will we eat? What if we don't make a kill? What can we do?<br>  <br>  In seeking to control the uncontrollable the shaman seeks empower the hunters by strengthening their resolve and to join with the animal in the spirit world to find and empathise with the creature so the hunt may be made to succeed.<br>  <br>  An agrarian society that raises crops and rears domesticated beasts has different needs. Generally the deities in these societies are to do with fertility or weather for obvious reasons.<br>  <br>  They don't need to find the wild and overpower it, they need to increase, protect and nurture that which is already held.|`|pgiGhD6Daa	Maybe cause the population was larger.

So some people grab for it, creating power-differentials greater than were possible before. Religion is just one aspect of that.|`|BMxNOJ39aa	A hunter gatherer society is mostly nomadic and organized around small family groups. Periodically, or seasonally these groups gather together. The instruction of the young is by oral traditions and the shaman performs the function of doctor, teacher and minster.<br>  <br>  With agriculture, permanent settlement is required, and a more organized way of doing things appears. The "tribe" now requires set boundaries for it's land and the ability to defend the land. Specialization in the crafts, religon and education appear.<br>  <br>  The hunter/gatherer societies grow by groups "budding off" from the original numbers, This increases the range of the society but at the cost or losing contact with each other. How many third or fourth cousins do you know? With a settled community there's geographic limits to growth.,plus more people that need to be organized.|`|Xq9iLKoIaa	Simply speaking.. there's nothing for a shaman to organise in a hunter gatherers life. They are generally mobile, with low population densities, and can't accumulate material wealth or control of large groups.<br>  <br>  There's no need to build large monuments or to control big groups of people, so a hierarchy is pointless.<br>  <br>  As agriculture (and population density) grows, sedentary populations can accumulate wealth and power, as can organized religions and priests. |`|FwueK3F9aa	I think of shamanism as the root of all spiritual practice and religion today. Shamans had a dual role they were the leader of the tribe in both physical and spiritual matters. I image as tribes came together and a central government was formed one leader or shaman rose above the other and became the dominate person and thus the dominate view. <br>  Shamanism didn't really disappear it just kind of branched out and got absorbed or changed into whatever the prevailing view of that society was. The shaman became the priest or priestess but still maintained their roles as healers, oracles and of course intermediaries between the common person and the spiritual world. Shamanism is not only about power animals it is also about teachers in human form and a teacher can be a divine being so it is easy in that light to see how the various God and Goddesses came to be know and in some cultures animals and God/Goddesses were mixed together but the basis of shamanism the journey itself to the spirit world still holds today it is just call meditation today but still uses prayer, fasting, drumming and chanting to help us try to connect to the divine just like the shamans did/do. If you are familiar with what is involved and what a shamanistc journey to either the upper or lower world is like you can see many examples of this in the religious texts we have today including the bible for example. The story or revelations is very much like a shamanistic journey

IF anything about your relationship with your mom would be detrimental it would be her over protectiveness and the way you were raised possibly with some one that had  an ongoing fear of the unknown. If this continues to be an issue for you don't be ashamed to see a counselor or psychologist and work this issue out.Good Luck.<br>  |`|kjawaCZAaa	Were you an only-child? I think this is a very common scenerio for an only-child.<br>  I think there are two kinds of sharing a bed; there is sleeping with another person, and there is being intimate with another person. I think people put too much emphasis on who sleeps where because they're so afraid of a sexuality issue. You're father was gone, you were alone, she was alone, so why not share some pillow talk and slumber. SHE'S YOUR MOM. <br>  I have a 20 year old son (only-child) whom I love unconditionally. He slept with me off and on until he was a teenager. He just slept better knowing I was there. And to this day I still hug and kiss him 'hello' and 'good bye' and when he visits I sit next to him on the couch and put my hand on his arm or around his shoulders. Sometimes I even hold hands with him for a few minutes. There's nothing sexual about that. HE'S MY SON.<br>  <br>  So unless your mom was sexual with you or you were sexual with her then I don't see anything for you to feel guilty about. And if there was some type of intimacy between the two of you that was inappropriate then you should talk to a therapist. <br>  <br>  Maybe you're just missing your mom right now. The holidays are here and it's a hard time for everyone who's lost someone close. I am so sorry for your loss. |`|AA12065654	I think there are a lot of really good reasons to sleep with your Mom, especially since the two of you were all each other had, really.  Comfort and a feeling of security is not a bad thing for sons to have.  And 12 years old is still a young child, and children need to feel loved, secure, and protected.  So if you got these (good) feelings from the sleeping arrangement, I think that's terrific.  I would however stop thinking of it as something "wrong" that you did.  Nothing wrong about it, however if you continue to see it as something "wrong", you are inviting feelings of regret, shame, perhaps guilt, and these feelings rarely help anyone or make them feel better or operate in a more adult manner.  If it had any effect on you, you'd know.  But I suspect that you have been subject to "other people's" evaluations of it.  Think of it as a wonderful gift that you had that time to share with your mother.  Some people would give everything to have what you had.  Be happy.
