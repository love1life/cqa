Mr Arshavin and the Spurs fans were on here bragging to us that he was going there because they could afford him and we couldn't.    Then he said he wanted to play for a "top" club.

OK OK OK it was a great performance but to me it only proved how selfish Kobe is.how do you have a game like that and have 0 rebounds, 0 steals, and only 3 assist.I am a big time Lakers fan and yet it seems like we are falling into another year were Kobe tries to do everything himself.Has he not realized that if he doesn't start trying to make a team out of the lakers then he will never win another title.What is he going to do when he plays the spurs, celtics, or cavs.because he's good but he isn't that good.I actually think that Lebron is better.He is more of a leader puts up around 30 points and still averages 7 assist and 7 rebounds.I give up on Kobe.I'M A CAV's FAN.I am from Ohio so I can do that.What do you think?
20090203111031AAfJnBg	Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (UK)	Liverpool Joke No offense meant?	Three Americans and three scousers are travelling by train. At the station, the three Americans each buy tickets and watch as the three scousers buy only a single ticket. "How are three people going to travel on only one ticket?" asked an American. "Watch" answers a scouser. They all board the train. The Americans take their respective seats but all three scousers cram into the toilet and close the door behind them. Shortly after the train departs, the conductor comes around collecting tickets. He knocks on the toilet door and says, "Ticket, please." The door opens just a crack and a single arm emerges with a ticket in hand. The conductor takes it and moves on. The Americans saw this and agreed it was quite a clever idea. So, on the return trip, the Americans decide to copy the scousers on the return trip and save some money. When they get to the station, they buy a single ticket for the return trip. To their astonishment, the scousers don't buy a ticket at all. "How are you going to travel without a ticket," asks one perplexed American. "Watch" says a scouser. When they board the train the three Americans cram into a toilet and the three scousers cram into another one nearby. The train departs. Shortly afterward, one of the scousers leaves his toilet and walks over to the toilet where the Americans are hiding. He knocks on the door and says, "Ticket, please".

He sits at the bar supping his pint when one gay gentleman decides to chance his luck. He approaches the Scouser and whispers something into his ear, whereupon the Liverpudlian turns around in complete disgust and horror and proceeds to punch the living fcuk out of the homosexual, fist after fist punching him out the door, kicking him across the pub car park, relentlessly punching and kicking until the victim lay comatose. The Scouser then dusted himself down and calmly returned to his pint at the bar, whilst the horrified staff and clientèle stood silent and motionless.      Eventually, the barman plucks up the courage to ask what had happened:      Barman: "Bloody hell mate. What on earth did he whisper to you?"      Scouser: "Dunno, something about a 'job'."

20090203123147AAx5WDO	Sports;Martial Arts	Is there anything I can do about my MMA record?	I have four amateur MMA fight, record of 3-1. I lose my first fight in a very questionable decision. I won two by submission and one by knock out. Unfortunately I only have a video of my first amateur MMA fight but not the rest and it isn’t exactly great because I was so nervous in that fight.   I have had four MMA fight so far and I’m so upset with the org that I fight for in last two fights. First two was in a very small unknown org and I won both fight in first round in devasting manner. So I tried to get in a bigger org but they asked for video and since I didn’t have much. They told me to get few more fights and if I do well they’d let me  fight for them.   So I found one event that wants me to fight for them. I’m naturally a light heavy weight fighter but they talk me into go up to heavy weight so I can fight in a tournament. They even offer extra payment with promise of big bonus and a title belt if I win the tournament. So I agreed to it.   To my upset, I fought this idiot who was 340 lbs and 6’2. He was a fat *** who rushed toward people and hammerfist them and throw them around the cage. But I thought I can find a way to exploit his game. So before the fight start, he got down on all four as if he was in football game. As soon as the fight started, to my surprise, he got up and rushed toward me at full speed. This threw me off the game plan, so I stalled for a second, but he was too fast. Before I know it, he bashed me on the head and face with his forearm and fists repeatedly. I tried to get away but he was just so fast that I was unable to. He end up get me in a bear hug and threw me down then pounds me on the face until ref stopped the fight. This make me look really bad especially since they refused to tell me who my opponent was the very last moment. I complained to them about this.   So two months later they offer me a fight with one guy who fight at 175 lbs I went down to 200 which was no easy task so he can go up to 185 and fight me. The whole round, he just run away and jabs or make weak counter or front kicked me right in the face every time I try to strikes or move forward. I was unable to land a single blow or get close enough to take him down. Finally he jumped in the air and kicked me in the head so hard that I was out. I almost have to be carried out on the stretcher. Later my coach found out this guy have over 40 muay thai fight, many of those was with world class kickboxer and he’s a regular sparring partner for many big name boxers because of his speed and unnatural reflex.   I am so upset about this. This org pitted me against fighter they know would beat me and make me look really bad. Now I have two videos of those fights and a ruined record of 2-2. No orgs have shown interested in me since then but for the one that set up two last fights.    What can I do about this mess? I'd like to get last two fights off records if possible.

20090203123545AAYEsoZ	Sports;Wrestling	Is Kane - Orton - Cena a possibility?	This is just a thought but now that Kane is in the elimination chamber he seems to be the only logical person to put the title on besides keeping it with Cena. Mysterio basically dropped to mid-card with the intercontinental championship tournament from what I see, Mike Knox is no where near ready, Kofi is receiving a push but I don't think they'll put a title on him and allow him to main event Wrestlemania, and Jericho ( the only other logical choice) seems to have special plans at Wrestlemania with the whole Rourke thing that's been going on, his apology with Stephanie, and Ric Flair returning.    I know Kane winning is unlikely and they will most likely have Cena retain but seeing as we have had Cena/Orton in a match a few times for last years Wrestlemania, wouldn't it be better to add Kane to the mix? Kane could win the championship and Cena gets his rematch at Wrestlemania and Orton challenges Kane with his royal rumble winnings. Kane beating Cena sets up a rivalry there and the whole Kelly and Orton storyline from before could be brought back to keep Kane and Orton in a feud + Kane qualified for the chamber by bringing Undertaker into the mix with Orton.     Do you think this match is a possible Wrestlemania main event?  BQ: What main event do you see at Wrestlemania for the WHC?  BQ2: What impact will Ric Flair have on RAW next week?  BQ3: How will Undertaker affect storylines and feuds in his appearance next week?

20090222202822AAAXAcJ	Sports;Basketball	Who thinks Kobe is way too overrated?	I'am a huge Kobe fan but I think he MIGHT be overrated. I say this because he misses to much lay-ups, he doesn't play defense (DID NOT SAY THAT CANT) (most of the times he don't even bother puting in a hand in the face),he misses mid range shots although is shot% stats is high,his shots difficulty doesn't seems to be hard like Wade's or Lebron's, and he never really has me jumping out my seat and screaming "oh sh!t, you seen that, danm man ". Like I said I'am a huge Kobe fan but every shot he took and every play he made I seen it been done by other NBA players.And if you throw in points stats then you are telling me you love greedy players.I seen Kobe many times  holding, dribbling and shooting the ball while be the only one to touch it in the team's possesion which gives up pontentially esier plays. Alright, may I went a little overboard to say his was the only one to touch the ball but you get my point though.But I have seem, for example, this season(forgot which game it was) LAL were down by 1-2pt with 10sec left , Kobe shoots the ball and misses which leaves about 5 secs.The team had a better chance for a easier shot if they work the ball arond than Kobe thinking that he is MJ.Does anyone remember what game it was.If so let me know.

I'm sure the points will eventually change later on in the season, but do you think this could happen? Or would you like to see this happen?

I recently purchased a Cannondale Super V700 mountain bike, and the rear mono shock is busted on it.

I've had trouble finding any other sites that provide information on shocks for this bike.  Any help would be appreciated.

Saw this item in the minutes of the February 8 Santa Anita Stewards Meeting, and I thought it was quite droll:      "02/06/09  BECCA HEARING      "Exercise rider ARIEL BECCA met with the stewards in an informal hearing to address a complaint (case number 09SA003) alleging that Mr. Becca had been working as a horseshoer without the proper test and license. This came to light when Mr. Becca was kicked and badly injured while shoeing a horse at Fairplex.        "In fact Mr. Becca appeared two weeks after surgery during which he had two metal plates implanted in his face. Mr. Becca acknowledged that he had been shoeing without a license but claimed that he only shod ponies. If true, the action would nevertheless represent a violation of the rule. However, under the circumstances, we felt that a warning was appropriate. The stewards are quite confident that Mr. Becca will not return to shoeing until he has procured a license."      D'ya think that the stewards are right about Mr. Becca not looking a hoof in the face (literally) again until he gets some training?  ;-))

Does anybody know if there's another name for it?  Or how to do it?

While my family and I were out hunting coons the other night, we brought along our 10-month old redbone coonhound along for the very first time. We were told by the previous owner that she had been trained before we bought her (we bought her 2 weeks prior to this). She started off on fire. She was finding trails and even flushed a skunk out. She cornered the the skunk under some branches, and my brother circled around to the side of the branches opposite of her and took a shot at the skunk (not very smart in my opinion). She jumped away from the branches and ran towards me and started cuddling up against my leg. For the rest of the night, she looked like she was finding trails, but she wasn't following them, and preferred to stay near me. We shot 9 coons the rest of the night, but we found them in the trees ourselves with no help from her. Is she gun shy now? If she is, can she be taught not to be?

20080706045435AAkJMqt	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Hunting	UK FAC - Expanding ammunition?	Hi there,       I am looking to apply for a firearms certificate so I can shoot vermin and foxes on some land that I've been granted permission on.      I'm planning on requesting a .22LR and .22 hornet, as I recently found out that you can't shoot foxes with .17HMR any more, so I decided on applying for a centrefire bullet to do the job instead.      Anyway, I want to make sure that I get expanding ammunition for both rifles to ensure a clean kill, but I don't know where on the application form to point this out.      In short, do I just write .22 hornet (Expanding) & .22 LR (Soft nose) in the ammunition section, or do those bullets have a certain chain of specific letters to point out that they're expanding?      Thank you!
