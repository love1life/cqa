The only feminists who I've met met who actually act like feminists are older (over 35) bi-sexual women.    Try to find a young attractive orthodox feminist.

Remember that nothing lasts forever and this too shall pass.  Have you mentioned it to her or asked her why she feels the need to do this?  She might tell you if something is bothering her but she probably isn't aware that she's doing this.  Talk to her and see if you can find an answer.

If it's a serious thing, it could mean either depression, suicidal intent or body dysmorphic disorder. You wouldn't really be able to tell in isolation.    If it's more like "I wonder if..." or "wouldn't it be terrible if..."  - a sort of fascination that feels like an impulse (like the impulse to jump off heights, etc) without genuine intent then it's sort of a neuronal trick - it's a high arousal idea (in this case, it would be a very bad, very painful and scary) so it has high activation, and may persist, resulting in this sensation.|`|iAM3gctWaa	Perhaps its a desire to commit ritual suicide as per the Japanese.
C8DOT8Y7aa	To dream that you are screaming, symbolizes anger and fear. It is an expression of your powerful emotions which you have kept pent up inside. If you try to scream, but no sound comes out, then is suggests that you need to immediately confront some situation. Perhaps you are unable to pinpoint your fears or feelings.   To dream that you are paralyzed, may reflect the current state of your body while you are dreaming. During the REM state of sleep you really are immobile and paralyzed. However symbolically, dreaming that you are paralyzed may mean you are feeling helpless or pinned down in some aspect or circumstances of your waking life. You may feel unable to deal with a situation or that you can't do or change anything. Alternatively, you may feel emotionally paralyzed. You may have difficulties in expressing yourself.   To dream that you are immobile, signifies feelings of being trapped or that you are rigid in your attitudes and decisions.|`|6qO1lieTaa	cuz your dream in ur mind

Teaching and nursing have been traditionally acceptable for women because of the very attitude you have, "feminism" wasn't needed to allow us to have those careers.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't assume someone's career is a substitute for a baby.  But then, I don't really get anything out of trying to find make believe reasons to invalidate someone else's life choices.  <br>  <br>  Edit:  That's a strange example, since few countries even allow women the opportunity to serve in direct combat, so it's not as if there are lots of "fighter pilot" positions even open to women.|`|QQQ36jMOaa	What about feminists and women who DON'T chose careers that are "maternal" in nature?  I know quite a few career military women (and was almost one myself) and I myself am going into the academic career as a professor.  Hardly mother stuff.  <br>  <br>  With the number of women joining the military rapidly rising (and making considerable jumps each year), I'd hardly argue that women are too "maternal" for the military.  As numbers show, the amount of women choosing the military is rising--not lowering or even leveling.|`|AHJZeo8Oaa	Do you know how much childless women's participation in full time work has risen since the 70s?<br>  <br>  Just 3%<br>  <br>  The real story is working mothers, which has increased massively in all categories.  Many women in the caring professions are mothers or carers outside of work, hence why they may choose those occupations as reflecting skills they felt they already possessed.  Most likely, that social worker, teacher or health worker is a mother too.<br>  <br>  The highest levels of childless women can be found in the 'masculine' professions which require long hours and absolute dedication to their job - lawyers, ceos, surgeons - not exactly a sign of neglected maternal instincts - or if it is, maybe that's the reason men choose them too lol  :-)|`|mSaRuowKaa	In fact you'll find that the reason there are so many women in 'caring' jobs like health care is because men are frequently discriminated against when trying to get jobs of that nature.

Both men and women chose a woman.|`|IuP0ryOMaa	I always pictured a feminist doing a manly job...like construction or something.  Who knows.

9okusH1kaa	If you're talking paleolithic stone age men - they went to sleep when they felt like it and woke up when they felt like it. <br>  <br>  They would have had bonfire and celebrations and a lot of religious ceremonies (they believed all sorts of crazy ****) that would have required them to be awake at night sometimes, but mostly they could do what they pleased at night time. They would usually socialize before going to sleep. <br>  <br>  In the day, they would have had certain work/jobs that they were expected to complete by their tribe, but otherwise they were free to do as they pleased. <br>  <br>  In various societies throughout history, there have been different schedules. In very hot places, mid-afternoon naps would have been a necessity. In cooler, wetter or shadier places, the people would work all day long. <br>  <br>  Also, it may be unhealthy but most people throughout human existence have been unhealthy and have died young. You wouldn't usually find people living past 35-40 in any society until the 1500s. Any after that most people still died very young. Most children would die and most adults would be dealing with aches and pains that would stop a modern man in his tracks - i.e. toothaches, arthritis, etc|`|bGlZ8I2iaa	Then there was the Indian alarm clock...just drink lots of water at bed time and you'll wake up early...usually about 4:00 AM....|`|dXrHoLMCaa	uh... there were no lights, so once the sun went down, you needed to be in the cave by the fire or get eaten by the lions.....!!.... and an early start meant you had more time to find food..... the only alarm they had was an empty belly....|`|22a6171dbf228d985a61502855bebebfaa	I get up at 0530 and don't go to bed until midnight most days.

XBKv57u6aa	The idea that taking your husband's name is "degrading" is completely absurd. If you don't take your husband's name, you're simply keeping your father's name.

JcC77x8Eaa	thats because i was behind you....|`|DAtqr0QHaa	You're gut feeling. It's kinda like your commonsence, it's like if an aligator turned its head toward you, you'd stay still. It's like common sence. I used to have those feelings but I was in my Auntie's house and it's like 200 yrs old. like 8 people died in the house.
nnpqvrhiaa	Hello, actually, scents and colours are well known to bring us 'flash backs'; it doesn't even have to be a 'scent' that you've worn, but a scent from the 'unconsious' past, that brings back memories.    The same happens to me..... smells/scent = good memories; colours = bad memories, even anxiety.    So, sweetie, you're not 'weird', you're completely normal, most people just don't say it out loud :)|`|I40vnqNyaa	Smell is a very strong trigger for memory.  Sometimes when i smell certain things it will trigger a memory and im right back there in my memory.|`|ZZQk010faa	Certain smells able to trigger memories of events taking place several years ago despite the fact that sensory neurons in the epithelium survive for about only 60 days. The answer is that the neurons in the epithelium actually have successors. As the olfactory neurons die, new olfactory neurons generated by the layer of stem cells beneath them, which eventually takes the role of the old neuron as it dies. The key point to the answer is that memories survive because the axons of neurons that express the same receptor always go to the same place. The memories are stored in the hippocampus, and through relational memory certain smells trigger memories.|`|AA10894849	There are two main structures linked to scent and memory: the amygdala and the hippocampus. Not only are they involved in smell, but they also play a role in emotional memory.    So, basically, molecules from the perfume you're smelling detach and attach to receptors in your nasal cavity. The receptors stimulate parts of the brain that identify and understand the smell. The olfactory (smell) parts of the brain stimulate the limbic system. Your limbic system contains the amygdala and hippocampus, which helps determine emotional memory.|`|bd0e62f6649334b0dc67af506ebd7128aa	Smell and taste are powerful sensual stimulants which the brain remembers. They can often trigger memories in an instant. It happens to all of us.

Frozen water means frozen sex. Either it's not happening or it's not passionate enough. Of course this is according to Freud so who knows.|`|VNRJnNr2aa	the dream means your in love with him but not ready...your caught in-between mates the ice skating indicates other mates that you put on ice you have many mates at your disposal but you dont know which one to give yourself over truly dont feel bad shop around and make friends not lovers for now..|`|n2y17YsOaa	It means that you should have went to class instead of ice skating.|`|C7Cz9qqTaa	you want him.<br>  lol
cf105WLxaa	I'd completely freak out in all of the above. I'd like to pretend to be open minded, but I would probably bring the wrath of hell down on them. And this is why I will never have children!|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Fortunately, my daughter chooses none of the above.<br>  <br>  If she wanted to be a skinhead, I would assume I had failed as a parent. (At least the neo nazi types.)<br>  <br>  Gangs don't appeal to her...she's not a follower.<br>  <br>  And porn is for women who don't mind being objectified. She would.|`|Olz3goEaaa	If my eighteen year old daughter wanted to do porn I would not be happy about it, but there is nothing I could do to stop an adult from making this choice. Also I would be a bit of a hypocrite because I have watched quite a bit of porn in my life.<br>  <br>  If my child became a gang member or skin head also I would not be happy about it, but if they were adults there is nothing I could do. Though I would try everything I could to talk them out of it.<br>  <br>  You are talking about extremes. The question if I remember correctly would be what if my kid had the exact opposite view of feminism. I said that after a certain age a person's choice is his or her own. What would you have me do not love my 30 son because he thinks differently from me?|`|XIbct4fuaa	We didnt say we would respect their wishes in every and all cases!  Those are extreme and horrible life choices.  Not simply opinions.|`|2eWVaB9Waa	Each in and of themselves perfectly legal????<br>  <br>  Well, i am not a parent so cannot say for sure. But based on the way I was raised, I would let my children be.<br>  <br>  There has to be a point IMO where as parents we have to let go. I know it's easy for me to say, but people must learn on their own. My love would always be unconditional but my guidance and protection can only go so far.<br>  <br>  What ever they choose, I will tell them personal responsibility. If my daughter wants to enter the porn industry, it's her choice. If my son wants to be a drug dealer, it's his decision. But I will tell them, they must live with their choices. <br>  <br>  Life has some very hard lessons that we must learn on our own.|`|IjSVNOZraa	For all of the above ---> I would tell them the dangers of it and hope they have enough common sense instilled in them to think otherwise|`|IuP0ryOMaa	if you raised your child right they wouldnt make those decisions.|`|NHBegq6Caa	becoming a skinhead isnt nessicarily dangerous. there are many of them out there that are anti violence and racism.|`|b937058afbee356089c255590894d7c9aa	I suspect we all have lines that we would not allow our child to cross (if we could keep them form it) and values that we would not support.  Being a feminist or anti-feminist is pretty benign to me.  I realize that it is not benign to everyone - but if that's your line in the sand, so be it. I'd choose to fight my battles elsewhere.|`|ZjCurM7saa	Why don't you pick something a little closer to feminism like "participate in a holocaust"?|`|S2vI4VEXaa	There's a difference between respecting and accepting.<br>  I'd accept it, as I wouldn't really have any other choice, I wouldn't respect it, and I would hope that we've done a good enough job as parents that it never happens.
xRZ1PRZwaa	As a mom and a step-mom, I've seen it all, and my opinions on subjects such as these have remained pretty steady through the years. Here's hoping for only a few thumbs down!<br>  <br>  1. I believe both parents should continue to support their child until that child becomes a legal adult and/or their parental rights are terminated.<br>  <br>  2. I personally have a very serious problem with incorporating gender-based language into any legislation of this sort. Either we are here to protect all, or we are here to protect none. A man's safety is no less important than a woman's. Men are abused regularly, and it's time that society acknowledge it and work to having it become acceptable to help men, not berate and make fun of them for being 'wimpy' or 'not being a man' or 'being whipped'. To me, this is unacceptable.<br>  <br>  3. I believe that incentive programs should be in place for those who need them and are worthy of them. Basing criterion on age, race and gender only serves to create and sustain barriers based on these differences. In a nutshell, we won't stop seeing differences if we continue to breath life into them.<br>  <br>  4. I believe that there absolutely need to be shelters for men. Protective shelters with appropriate resources, not a soup kitchen, not a homeless shelter and not the Y. Further to that, I think there need to be shelters for men and their children. I do believe that because of the nature of domestic abuse, shelters for men and women need to remain separate; not for perpetuating differences or inequality, but for the physical safety of those seeking assistance.<br>  <br>  5. Status quo is status garbage. The reality is that men are far more involved with parenting than they were 50 years ago. However, the 'system' has yet to acknowledge this. I wonder if the courts default should simply be shared co-parenting with the strong recommendation for a mediator to assist with the transition to a new family lifestyle. Taking children from a caring, involved father is unacceptable to me, and I think it's high time that dads not be sacrificed in the name of a failed marriage. Marriage and parenting are not synomyous, nor should they be treated that way.<br>  <br>  Great question!<br>  <br>  p.s. I'm confused by the comments about alimony. Alimony represents money paid to an ex-spouse and is different from child support. I didn't get the impression that alimony was discussed at all in the question posed.|`|V1MptCMiaa	Because I don't see any men fighting for their rights.  I only see women doing it.  We all know that feminists aren't really fighting for "equal" rights, but "women's" rights, so it's up to men to fight for men's rights.  Stop b*tching and get to it!|`|ZqjGWbavaa	What I don't understand is how people still argue these are okay. Also, I didn't know 1. Are you sure that's true?|`|b0dee10a6de166bc265de45ecc7668e0aa	1.  Not true.   <br>  2.  Yep we have laws to protect children.   Why shouldn't we???<br>  3.  No these are LOANS which means they are paid back!  It evens the playing field.<br>  4.  If there is not a need for a full time shelter, why would any organization pay for it.   Its much easier to pay as they go for hotel rooms to house men and their families.   <br>  5. False - men when disputing custody are gaining it even when they are suspected abusers 63% of the time.|`|XIbct4fuaa	The pendulum swings both ways.  Someday we might be able to find a balance but it probably wont be in our lifetimes.  All we can do is live our life within our circle of influence and try to be as equal as we can.|`|ro7JSflXaa	In a word, feminism.  They should call it anti-equality, pro-misandry|`|BkleL3F4aa	feminism is a supremacist movement that hides behind the word equality.|`|DF6T48Praa	These laws and practices are in place to protect the minority. Simple as that. <br>  <br>  1) A man does not have to pay child support if his child is adopted.<br>  <br>  2) Laws protect women, children, and infants (though infants are children...) because for so many centuries laws have not protected women and children. For once, women and children are protected under law. I don't know why anyone would want it differently. What is sad is that BECAUSE laws PURPOSEFULLY ignored women and children is WHY we now must have laws that protect them. If they were initially protected than those laws would be unnessesary. <br>  <br>  3) I know white men always get the short end of the stick (*cough* choking on sarcasm) but once again because loans were purposefully ignoring women and minorities and would ALWAYS give preferential treatment to white men, the law stepped in to protect the interests of the minorities. White men rule the world-why would ANYONE with any idea of the history of the world-think that white men have it hard???MAkes no sence.<br>  <br>  4) Shelters exist for those who need it most. Do men need shelters? Yes, and I greatly support shelters for me. But lets be honest, women and children seek shelters out by and far more than men. That is why shelters exist for women and children.<br>  <br>  5)In most cases, unless the man is deemed incompetant if a man wants shared custody, he gets it. But if the mother was the primary caregiver to the child than courts of course do not want to take that child from it's caregiver. Why would anyone?? Granted, it is not a perfect system. But men just typically are not the care givers to their kids. Women are.  It sucks when things are unequal right? Now you see what women and minorities have had to put up with since recorded history.<br>  <br>  I understand your points, but the 'woe is the white man' story just doesn't cut it with me :).<br>  <br>  Edit: I definitly disagree with any man or woman being made to pay child support if they put their kid in foster care or adopt them out. I can only go by the fact that I asked a child support officer if men had to pay child support in the above mentioned circumstances and he said no, at least not in California. If there is another law, then I am unaware of it.<br>  <br>  And yes, discrimination against any race is wrong, I just don't see discrimination against white men happeneing. IMHO. :)|`|phJfL2wTaa	By nature humans are not equal, never have been, never will be.<br>  Equality has a different meaning to each person.<br>  Equality under the law will always have inequalities in practice because individual humans are never equal and rarely agree what equal actually is.<br>  The only equality possible is for government to supply a level playing field and leave the intrinsic differences in humans alone.  Trying to create equality where it does not exist leads to greater inequity than we started with.|`|A71Uu05Uaa	Because feminism has taken the position of the equality lobby even though they care not for equality.  Only the special treatment of women by government.<br>  <br>  And because they shame anyone who speaks against them, we don't have enough people who are actually fighting for real equality.<br>  <br>  Sad but true.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Dayvid,<br>  I am a 46 year old caucasian male and I have only one question for you.  Do you believe that with all the "legal advantages" you cite, that it is better/easier preferable to be a woman?  Given a choice would you rather be a woman than a man?  <br>  <br>  Let me give you a personal example of male/female equality.  My wife spent almost 20 years raising our kids and supporting me in my career.  If we split now, she would get a little alimony for 3 years and that is it.  I would continue to earn a multi six figure income and she would have to try to build a career from scratch with a 20 year gap in her resome.  For the rest of our lives I would continue to reap the benefit of her having supported the heck out of me while I climbed the corporate ladder and she would likely never recover financially from being out of the workforce for 20 years.<br>  <br>  And as for "she chose to stay home".  Maybe she did.  But the truth is that our kids, my personal DNA benefited hugely from that.  <br>  <br>  One last thing.  Women who abandon their children are most often highly dysfunctional.  Pressing them for money is not practical and in some cases not humane.  Men however are biologically much more capable of procreating and walkting away even if they have decent jobs etc.

Physical attraction is important, theres no doubt. But when it all comes down to it, you need someone that you can hold a conversation with and you respect. You cant respect him if you describe him as "stupid and boring". He may be fun to have right now, but in the long run your making a mistake. Unless he opens up and shows you his personality, the relationship will go no where.

ziHYFQpkaa	In my case i think thats true. I'm the older sister and I've always had a lot of stress. I have a lot more responsibility than my younger sister (I'm the one that cleans, cooks ect.) and I do think that stress takes a toll on my skin.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	True. Experience finds itself invalid before youth sometimes.|`|o2FJIXS9aa	In my case that is very true. My youngest sister could have been a model in her youth. She greatly resembles Sandra Bullock but I've always thought her even better looking. I think being the oldest child has it the hardest, especially for females. That's what I am. My mother always said that she thinks all her children are beautiful in their own way. My youngest sister had the least responsibility, was the most spoiled, and got better genes. Sometimes I get told I look like a younger version of Lauren Bacall, and I feel like asking, " How much younger?" As long as dad's sperm was doing fine and mom's eggs were working well, they managed to produce 6 of us by the time mom hit 30. I do more think it's genetics than anything else.|`|s3IBrhZCaa	i have not noticed this. what i have noticed though is that many times a very attractive lady.......her mother looks like she was hit by an F-5 tornado on a spring day in Oklahoma.    always look at the mother. the cute young 22 year old may be great now......but by the time she is 28 she is going to look like a large farm animal.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	Why, thank you!|`|62ZBofvPaa	It might be your confirmation bias seeing as I never noticed this, but to give you a hypothesis if I assumed your observation correct--it's a fact that the more pregnancies a woman has, the more feminized her kids are, because she's more resistant to testosterone.    It's been established that younger sons have less testosterone, are more likely to be homosexual...younger daughters might end up prettier and more feminine looking.|`|kl1kzlzXaa	Residual sex hormones in the mother's blood.

(Personally I've always thought my older sisters were more attractive).|`|un0C52G8aa	Do you think Ashlee Simpson (especially pre-plastic surgery) is more attractive than her older sister Jessica?|`|MwuhNKvYaa	I have a younger sister. Neither of us is more attractive or less attractive than the other, although people do have their opinions. I have softer, more diminutive features than her, people call my look doll-like or elven. My sister has bolder, stronger features, she has a more aggressive look, but people say we are both "exotic". She resembles my father more and I resemble my mother more. I don't think it has anything to do with birth order, it's just a random toss up of genes.|`|CXqXdsK6aa	yes!    I know EXACTLY what you mean, i've been screaming this for years, but i can't prove it except to point it out case by case. I can't tell if its a general case, or only the women I care to notice the rest of their family.    Although, it seems the opposite for cute girls and their moms. You think a girl is cute, but then you see what her mom looked like at her age and you feel disappointed. As if the model you got was a downgrade from the original.

LNHcy0Hbaa	. . . . . . hmm confuzzling|`|GNbWybU7aa	In a sense.    An addiction is something you WANTED to do or try in the first place, right? Well not the addiction but whatever you were addicted to (ex. sex, pepsi, texting).    I'm gonna reference a book i've read, Choke by Chuck Palahniuk. The main character's friend had an addiction, so he started a new hobby to help cease that addiction. His new hobby, rock collecting, turned into another addiction.    Just as a business man wakes up, goes to work, comes home, spends time with his family - every day activities - are said to be addictions because it's something he does EVERY DAY. He can't stop it unless he wants to say become a legal gypsy and hand over all his social and legal papers so he can become an official no one. Then, he would be addicted to nothing (pun intended).      BUT I digress and i apologize if you did not understand what i was ranting all about.|`|ToILKl6waa	I believe so. An addiction is by far the most difficult thing to overcome, for you need enough willpower and mind discipline to overcome it. And if you can do that, getting through other big challenges shouldn't be a problem for you.
qRxhF1ARaa	I think we just tend to take it more personal, because it's a more intimate kind of relationship. However, I have experienced more hurt by losing a friend than by losing a potential mate in my own life, because I was essentially closer to the friend and felt a greater loss. I think it all comes down to how attached we are to the person rather than the role they play in our life. I still have a harder time over the loss of my dog than I do over ex's I've had... but then, my dog was a better companion. That may sound a little weird, but it's true. When someone dumps you, I think when the initial pain dissipates, you have a clearer view of where your pain truly originated from... and it's usually just an insecurity of your own that caused it to hurt so bad, and not just the loss of the person who dumped you. That's where we learn the things about ourselves that help us to enter other relationships with a stronger sense of who we are and what we need from those relationships. It's all part of growing and self-discovery.|`|ZwECcnh1aa	We all have a strong need to be loved, and we tend to place those needs in the hands of the people we are most intimate with. We not only want the lover to be our whole world, we also want to be his/hers whole world aswell. When that fails, it is a big loss. Depends though, if you lose a really good friend it can hurt more than someone youve only been dating for a month. It depends on the situation. But generally we look to lovers to fulfill more of our needs.|`|ZsFosBBQaa	its actually due to ur higher level of expectation on a particular relationship..<br>  expectation really hurts..<br>  <br>  do try to learn from ur past and make urself strong to face the reality in life..|`|a3e42390e39921e088af17ae2a07303eaa	Honestly? Well, we have been raised and grown to believe in a fairytale perception. When we don't get this fairytale ending, we simply don't understand what went wrong. Its not necessarily that we have stronger feelings for our partners than our friends. We, as girls (Im guessing?) have an expectation that is quite unfair to the man. When we get dumped, our expectations and our hopes are broken. <br>  Hope I helped<br>  Best wishes :)
11ca49b2da96e1f24af357dd81286a71aa	I want to start by saying, Interpretations come from the Lord.  But this reminds me of the story Frank Peretti wrote called "Tillie".   (check it out at family.org )The dream sounds like an ultra sound of a pregnancy and then what happens during an abortion.  Has there been any history of that in your past or in someone you know?  This last week was sanctity of human life week and maybe you heard something that triggered this dream.  Just remember that this is just a dream and not necessarily a prediction of the future (or revelation of the past).  I hope that you are able to carry a child of your own.  It is a wonderful experience.  I have 8 children!

ZD4qrJ8qaa	Exercise, yes it really works. Have you ever heard anyone say, I get an exercise high.  its true.  It helped me get out of my funk after my BF fro almost 3 years and I broke up.  Plus, the extra benefit was that I got totally fit and he tried to come back a couple of months later.  But by that time, I had more energy, self esteem, and knew that he was no good for me.|`|ZlcYSRviaa	exercise, it will release endorphins into your body making you feel better, also make sure you are getting plenty of sunlight. those are the easy answers, also while you don't want to get involved with a guy sexual intercourse also helps with getting a positive outlook.|`|9FhFIc3haa	First off, I'd go to a spa, or do something for yourself, that always makes everybody feel better. Do everything you've always wanted to do for yourself, whether it's a haircut or a tattoo, and go shopping. Buy whatever clothes you see that you like, then you'll go to work the next day, and you'll be a brand new you. If you're feeling confident, you'll feel happy. Then once you're happy, you'll want to do other things, like trying to meet new people. But don't try to do everything at once, work on making yourself happy, then go from there.
xst7KYQ3aa	like mentioned by the answerer above, dreams don't necessarily predict the future.  Dreams come in different varieties, and use symbology rather than concrete facts/experiences more often than not.  They also tend to mix the different 'varieties' or types of dreams.  There are informational dreams, conflict resolving dreams, future knowledge dreams, and even dreams that are pure -entertainment-...the brain likes to keep busy even while you sleep, and dreams are one way that  the brain keeps busy..since the dream world is an unconscious world, you will see things in dreams that you know even while dreaming can't be true or real.  since i don't know your background or what events are happening in your life, it's really difficult to make any ONE TRUE interpretation.  That's hard enough when you know someones personal background.  generally, that  amount of horror and gore (blood and bodies) means some kind of change has happened or is going to happen, but not necessarily bad.  the sequence you describe starts with just one person, the killer, and you with your family hearing it on the news at the same time.  the group event can mean that whatever the situation or happening is, it will affect you and those close to you.  running away from the situation indicates you may be resisting the change, while coming back out of hiding months later indicatess tthat there is nothing you can do that will stop the event(s), that it will happen with or without your coopration.  Again, it isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's just the way your sub-conscious is using it's symbology to present wahtever it is to you.  But, like i said, it could be nothing more than an -entertainment- dream.  i wouldn't stress too much over it :)|`|w8aBIkz2aa	dreams dont necessarily predict the future  or whats going to happen [thats good in your case]  do you remember if  you watched a horror movie before   the dream? Or maybe something you watched or talked  about influenced this dream you had. This could also be a big fear  that you have, which is to be left behind, alone.|`|1dd3015e4abb995aac14182f6e62de33aa	Wow, you could see the election results with Obama winning?  That was 3 years in the past, wow!!!|`|8722a385a740fd3c165b65c08ed568ffaa	you need to change something in your diet
ICIh3t0Caa	girl the same thing has happened to me all i can suggest is for you to stay as far away as possible,because the more he comes around the more interested you will become,you'll start seeing qualities in him that you dont see in your fiance then you say to yourself they are only thoughts cant nothing become of them, up until you start laughing at all his jokes and find yourself asking and thinking about him or even wondering what he would be like in bed, so my best bet is for you to get him hooked up with one of your home girls just to play it safe|`|aytjUJf6aa	your naughty side just wants to come out and play you can act just a little bit (naughty) totally but dont do any thing you are not comforable with|`|Imn5oOWiaa	Maybe deep down your fiance isn't fulfilling everything you need in a relationship. write out a list of the good qualities and the bad qualities of your fiance's.. then do the same for his co-worker.. <br>  <br>  if the good things of the co-workers list match up with the bad on your fiance's list.. that might be the issue.
sZeBrVLVaa	Yes - investment, consumption and all other elements of both the IS and LM curves have 'exogenous' elements, meaning that it is possible for some outside factor to cause them to shift. So, as you say, an exogenous increase in investment will cause the IS curve to shift right leading to an increase in the interest rate.<br>  <br>  Other factors could be an increase in consumption or government spending, or (on the LM side) a restriction of the money supply or sudden increase in money demand.|`|6296beaabcf8f4682bfa047d500f8e9aaa	Not exactly, an increase in savings will lead to a decrease in interest rates - demand and supply...<br>  <br>  A decrease in interest rates would lead to an increase in interest rates.<br>  <br>  The best way to answer this is to think of all the factors that contribute to the interest rate, many of which are missing from the ISLM diagram.  Then work out what changes in those would lead to an increase in interest rates.
fUqGCfnCaa	To dream that you are murdered, suggests that some important and significant relationship has been severed and you are trying to disconnect yourself from your emotions. It also represents your unused talents.<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  To dream that you have been killed, suggests that your actions are disconnected from your emotions and conscience. Alternatively, the dream refers to drastic changes that are happening in your life. There is a characteristic that you want to get rid of or a habit that you want to end within yourself. Killing represents the killing off of old parts of yourself and old habits.<br>  <br>  <br>  To see a dog in your dream, indicate a skill that you have ignored or forgotten, but needs to be activated. Alternatively, dogs may  symbolize intuition, loyalty, generosity, protection, and fidelity. Your own values and intentions will enable you to go forward in the world and succeed. If the dog is vicious and/or growling, then it signifies some inner conflict within yourself. It may indicate betrayal and untrustworthiness. If the dog is dead or dying, then it indicates a loss of a good friend. Alternatively, it represents a deterioration of your instincts.|`|pRn1h2Hlaa	Self conscious about the way your face/certain feature is and what other people think about it? Or are you worried about a guy atm,scared that he night judge? Death means a new beginning. Maybe you want to change something about your overall appearance that will do you good in the long run.<br>  Th mind works in weird ways. Take care.|`|VNRJnNr2aa	This dream means:// Your planning on moving because of your neighborhood conditions..|`|dbdd9e3edfbe8f7ed2777a74ffec9b4eaa	To dream of being killed represents the dreamer coming under an influence - usually external - which is making him, or an aspect of his personality, ineffective in everyday life.<br>  <br>  Killing is an extreme answer to a problem. It is such a final act that in dreams it can often represent the dreamer's perception if the need for violence, particularly against himself, Perhaps the only way a solution to a problem can be reached is by 'killing off'' part of himself. There is no denying in this case the potential for violence, although ultimately the impulse may not be correct.|`|AA10877025	yuk sounds not a nice dream sounds like you're trying to avoid something that is affecting everyone around you but you think it won't affect you but it does.perhaps it means don't walk around with your eyes shut there are things in your life you should attend to.|`|n2y17YsOaa	My friend had a dream very similar and he died January 14, 2007.

K2h6M1xqaa	Courage is having the willingness to get hurt in an effort to achieve something of value.<br>  <br>  I think it is better to say that some people lack courage, rather than to declare them cowards.  --Lacking courage suggests by its very nature that one might *get* courage.  Being a coward, however, sounds more like a permanent condition.<br>  <br>  Though, I have found that this is often the case.  If one doesn't have courage today, what will change so that one will have courage tomorrow?  --Especially since 'changing' is often the very thing people lack the courage to do.<br>  <br>  But that doesn't always mean one should jump into something carelessly to demonstrate courage.  Building up to a bold action carefully and thoughtfully is not cowardice so long as one gets the job done.  Indeed, this is Wisdom.  Though, sometimes jumping in the instant is the wise thing to do.<br>  <br>  Courage and Discernment go well together.<br>  <br>  EDIT************<br>  <br>  I have to disagree with one of the previous posters.  --While body chemistry might send some people running into burning buildings on rescue missions, that is only one expression of courage, (and I hesitate to call it that since an involuntary action based on hormones, etc. does not require will power.)<br>  <br>  I've seen many Alpha male types who do not have the courage to admit when they are wrong.<br>  <br>  It takes enormous Courage, I think, to exert Will over one's natural automatic desires and reactions.|`|TDVIb4SBaa	Yes I agree however sometimes when perceived to be brave it could be construed as being fool hardy.Bravery comes in many forms,the person who faces danger the person who faces illness bereavement many situations.<br>  One does not have to be construed  a coward to avoid danger commonsense should be included,it is  all down to the situation and time someone finds themselves in|`|Zu0Qt8fjaa	I agree with most of your points, however I do think some people are more willing to show bravery than others, its their personality.|`|qbSpq86saa	i agree|`|rVFuRc6Vaa	its in us all just some people find it easier than others to display tese traits|`|JWNzoksmaa	Actually, it's been scientifically proven that there is a difference between "brave" and "cowardice" types of ppl...or alpha vs beta.  <br>  <br>  Basically, the ppl that can run into a burning building to save pets and ppl are different by their chemical make-up.  it has to do with how much the body produces the fight or flight chemicals and how well you body responds to those chemcials.  <br>  <br>  I was just watching a documentary about that on NatGeo.  I'm sure you can look it up also.  But yes there is a difference and it's more difficult for some ppl than it is for others to be brave.  It all has to do with your genetic make-up.  Yes, I believe that confidence does have something to do with it, but no matter how confident you are...if your body/brain is producing chemicals that tell you to run...well there's just not much you can do about it.  <br>  <br>  Some ppl are just born with more bravo than others.  it's a defense mechanism that somewhere in during your families genetic line decided that flight is more suitable to your genes than fight is.  <br>  <br>  Sorry dude.

9mBUqSZhaa	Sometimes people have correct visions of the future in their dreams. <br>  It's usually things that your subconcious cannot understand while you are awake. <br>  <br>  When you're asleep, your brain processes everything it couldn't understand and puts it into dreams. Usually your fears, or just basic feelings you have. <br>  <br>  It's very important to study your dreams; they tell you so much about yourself.<br>  <br>  "If you really want to know what you're thinking; listen to your heart when your mind wanders." It wanders while sleeping.|`|m1Yr8EMAaa	You always have a dream, you just don't always remember them. It depends on what stage of sleep you are having them in. Also it is a collection of everything in your mind that you have filter in. It is a way for your mind at night to go through information and get rid of or place un important stuff in certain areas. It is actually a really interesting and complicated process (which the mind is of course) I'm sure there are plenty of books you could get to read up on it.|`|TnusF2KUaa	ive read a book on this :D<br>  <br>  ok, so basically dreams are sometimes our minds way of telling us things in its own, twisted way. sometimes i dream about people in my life, but no usually about my day. who wants a re-run?<br>  <br>  i dont usually remeber what i think about when i fall asleep. dreams help us deal with problems that might be bothering us that we are unaware of. if there is something in our lives that is troubling us, dreams are one way to work them out.<br>  <br>  the reason we tend to forget dreams very quickly is that when we dream, self consciense (i dun know the spelling) kinda goes into another demention. our mind is free from earthly restraints, and sometimes we can even communicate with the dead. its seems like itd be kinda easy for some thoughts to get left behind when we return to the waking world. and easy solution? keep a notepad by your bed and write down ur dream as soon as u wake up. it helps. i do it :)<br>  <br>  sometimes we are to tired to dream. this means that our body needs a full, deep sleep. dreams sometimes can make our minds work harder as they fight to recieve and understand them, so sometimes we can rest peacfully without this burden. other times it is possible our brain has nothing to tell us.<br>  <br>  my sugestion for u? a book called "Dreamers Dictonary" its inturprets dream meenings and helps us further understand them.  dreams can be future tellings, signs, communication with the dead, or signs telling us how to improve our lives. the real question is: will we listen?|`|ChmuSKpVaa	I dream about hopes, things i would like to do, things i was worried about, stuff i am scared of, we dream of stuff we know in our heart.|`|IlwaP5gAaa	theres a saying that goes" U have maybe thousands of dreams a night, but u would be lucky if you could remember one."<br>  <br>  I also hear its just ur subconsciouse just its way of dealing with ur probluems<br>  <br>  but thats all i got|`|V6dz395kaa	Dreams tell u how u feel through the day.|`|88c3674727627180279957a05a038278aa	well i think dreams are just a bunch of people you know or a bunch of poeple you dont know who you just combine together and make something out of like no where, sometimes you dream about something that happened that day and sometimes you dream about stuff that happens right before you go to bed, and you forget your dreams because alot of them are so short that they dont stay in your head, and its not that you dant have dreams you have at least 10-15 dreams a night and dont even know it!  So my name is Sarah im 12 years old and that my opinion it seems pretty reasonable right? and im only 12!|`|EhdXrGlyaa	It's just something in your head that makes a picture in your mind.It's very hard to explain.You forget your dreams really easily because your asleep when you dream and it's just,well,actually just go to Google.They'll give you a better statement on your question!|`|EQWSHzoLaa	Well if you dream something and then it happens it is called deja vu<br>  (pronouciation-day jaw vu) you forget about dreams because your asleep when you have them you dont have dreams sometimes because your not thinking about anything

There is no escape from them, and without them we would not develop into whole and strong individuals. Don't fear them... many are just tools for learning how to live life. It's much better to face your challenges in life than to run from them... or worse... refuse to participate at all.

myG2hhaKaa	I majored in psychology, and you really don't need much math. My school had one math requirement, and I took statistics (that also cancelled out my need to take Psychological Statistics.)  So, I killed two birds with one stone.    If you are in high school, I'd recommend taking: general psychology, general sociology (This is not necessary in college, but alot of times you'll need another social science or humanities class. This is easy and enjoyable), statistics (This was offered in my senior year, a half yr class. I am so happy I took it! It helped alot. And, it's one ofthe easier math courses, in my humble opinion.)    I never had to take algebra in college (but it's good idea to take in HS, though!)     If you go on to grad school (which you probably will have to do as a child psychologist) then you will probably have to take upper level Statistic courses - probably only one or two.|`|Gvvn84q6aa	Don't worry about it until college. Just take algebra 1 and 2 in high school. In college you will take college algebra and statistics. Stats can be pretty annoying and knowing which stats to use is equally annoying.|`|CAJAOE1Daa	Statistics|`|AA10447831	go to a college website and look at majors and requirements or email them and ask for a catalog.

When our loved ones visit us rather than it being just a dream we tend to realise in our dream that that they have passed over. So rather than it being memories of times gone by something in the dream lets us know it is now, not before they passed. It is the easiest way for our loved ones to contact us through dreams and they do it a lot. Also sometimes the dreams seem really lucid, like they are real, sometimes though it can be just a dream, but then it is memories of stuff we have done in the past.|`|bPKXu0oPaa	Hello (:  Well I remember reading somewhere that everything we dream about comes from something we've experienced at some time or another  So basically your mind is replaying past memories  It's only natural for you to be dreaming about her  Hope this helps xx
ML7FRVzIaa	I am the same, blame the media. You probably have fallen into a depression stage and now all i do is judge and degrade my self. I can't sit here and lie.

0PVp8Okoaa	Judgemental people.. are annoying. Always gives me anxiety lol.  I don't know what's okay to judge and what's not okay. I guess it's different for everyone. You may be sensitive to judgements cause maybe something happened in your past that has caused it. I guess those judgemental people will just have to accept that people are not clones, everyone's different therefore people have different actions and interests.  It's called being HUMAN.|`|dE3Uozfwaa	I would be a hypocrite if I said you shoudln't judge people.  But I don't like it, and try to catch myself when I judge people.|`|i3w1G65Baa	Everyone is judgemental to a certain extent, just by you asking this question you are being judgemental.|`|LNHcy0Hbaa	everyone has their own opinion so in every ones opinion there is a different limit of where to draw the judgmental line hence the difference of rudeness and constructive criticism.    wow that was difficult to write what a confuzzling question!|`|GNbWybU7aa	'Judge' isn't exactly the word choice i use. I prefer to use 'read'.  I read people. I can tell what people are like according to music taste and opinions. But sometimes my skill of that can deceive me...    It's really a tough thing to say. Judging - everyone does it. There's even a CAREER for it. I'd have to say it was okay, but there's careers for far more sick things.    It's an ongoing debate.      "I am free of all prejudices. I hate everyone equally." -- W.C. Fields.|`|C0F4OFrcaa	I guess everyones judgemental to some extent, its pretty much human nature. Whats so iffy about it is how people express those judgements..    Im one who likes to discuss things which are very opinion based but I never ever say that someone is wrong. If I disagree, thats all it is, a disagreement.    Political views.. Kind of. I guess their political views sheds some light on who they are as a person.  Music? No way in hell. Thats just as bad as judging someone on what they like to eat or who theyre attracted to! Really small things like this are just not worth judging, its mroe trouble than its worth.    I judge people based onw hat they say and what they do, behaviour pretty much. If I dont like a person I wont persecute them or discriminate. Hell no.. Id just stay away from them. Let them be.
YpkbW8STaa	Maybe you feel helpless in some situation in your life. That could be why you are fighting, and unable to fight back due to your weakness. Also, maybe you have been going through something that is either emotionally or physically that is making you tired and unable to cope.     Honestly, you just have to think of corresponding things in your own life to figure out a dream like this.|`|hy3f7XqDaa	i feel like that to! haha  like when you try to hit them its like in slow motion   i dont know what that is://    im sorry but i know how you feeel lol|`|0ShFbrgQaa	yeah that happens to me to sometimes  it feels really weird  it's not anything psychological|`|je6dZCYkaa	maybe its because someone in your life is putting you down, and making you feelbad.

84gK4XlHaa	In its most simple definition, it's just a belief that women should have social, economic, and political equality to men.  Beyond that it gets a bit complicated.  There are many different schools of feminist thought ranging from first wave, second wave, third wave, French feminist, Socialist, Radical, Liberal, Post-Colonial, Black...the list goes on and on.  But despite what some men and women will claim, there is no one, unified definition of what makes a modern feminist.  More importantly, no incarnation of feminism has ever promoted the idea that all men are evil or that we should start eradicating them.  That's just idiocy.  My advice would be to ask your Aunt how she defines feminism as it really varies from person to person.|`|mZVk3fP4aa	People who say feminism is a doctrine of hating all men are just paranoid freaks, or liars who feel threatened by women's rights. As far as I'm concerned, it's just equal rights, and no special privileges for either gender.|`|mCAWxobNaa	Sure, in its modern usage, Feminism refers to the doctrine of hating all men and having a sense of supremacy above all others.  Vengeance against men for atrocities of the past is critical to the doctrine.    The goals are simply to propagate this doctrine of hate and to ensure that lies are spread to keep the ball rolling.  If the goals were more substantive, there'd be no goal for this silly, self-serving doctrine that is irrelevant in 2009.|`|3862H0WVaa	Feminist authors main goal is to make money  Feminist politicians main goal is to have power over everyone male and female.  Feminist extremists ( which includes the ones above ) are lacking something.....  Feminist separatives are usually gay and don't want the competition from males.  Casual feminists are just annoying.|`|iRKOJhYeaa	I am really not sure these days. Once upon a time a feminist was someone (female OR male) who believed in equality for women. Believed that women should be treated equally to men, and not treated like some second class citizen. These days however, it seems like in a lot of cases it has taken on a whole new meaning. Now that women have achieved equality in many (not all) aspects of life, there are those that now think that women should have superiority, and that men should be treated as inferior, as they (women) once were.|`|ndopqX6Taa	There is the dictionary definition, then there are agendas others have. There is a fine between them in what some define women's rights and entitlement and hatred.    I prefer the dictionary version.

However, I sometimes get the idea that some girls are only after older men because of money they might have saved or worked hard to get. Take the "Real wives" on oxygen. Maybe the show isn't complete reality but there are women like one blonde I saw on there.

Espero que hoy te sientas mejor. Por el nombre que has escogido, y por la pregunta que haces, veo que eres un ser sensible. Pero creo que no tienes que tener temor al preguntar esto. La gran mayora de los seres humanos nos hacemos esta pregunta, casi todos los das. Y solo muy pocos han descubierto ese por que. He ledo las otras respuesta, y sin faltarles al respeto, creo que ustedes mismo se hacen esta pregunta; y lo nico que han hecho es dar una justificacin, que es lo que hemos experimentado desde chiquitos. Mira: Desgraciadamente vivimos en un sistema social brutal y agresivo. Desde que entramos a la escuela , basado en un sistema cruel que lastima  el espritu tierno de un ni?o, enfrentndolo a una competencia con los otros ni?os, a ver quien tiene mejores calificaciones. Y el que tiene mejores calificaciones se siente superior y es el preferido del maestro ( te das cuenta del papel de maestro: el que sabe )  y el que saco malas nota, que crees que siente?. Ya lo has vivido, o no. y ah empieza la comparacin, la separacin. Y aqu uno se dice quiero ser como el, para ser querida y aceptada, ( para no ser lastimada, para no sentirme mal por que todos se burla de mi, para que me acepten )  en ese momento uno deja de ser uno, por que quiere ser como el otro. Y por miedo  a ser  un perdedor, uno empieza a hacer cualquier cosa, por no ser lastimado. La gran mayora de los ni?o, entran al proceso de competencia: Mi papa es mejor que el tuyo, tu eres pobre y yo soy rico. Y lo que era el paraso del jardn de ni?os, se convierte en un infierno de competencia, gracias al sistema de calificaciones y al maestro. ( El que sabe )  Lo increble es que aqu, es que no hay culpable. Nuestros padres les paso lo mismo, a nuestros abuelos tambin y as. Y a nosotros nos pasa, por que no hay otra alternativa. Somos como hoja al viento. Si me dices que lo hago muy bien me siento la gran cosa ( aun que me lo dicen nada mas para usarme ) o me dicen que soy un idiota cuando realmente lo hice muy bien por que tienen envidia y quieren hundirme, para sentirce bien ellos cuando me ven hundido. Y cuando estoy hundido tengo miedo terror, ( todo el miedo que recuerdo desde mi infancia)  y una vez que me ven acabado, me dicen no te preocupes,( yo soy mejor que tu ) yo se ( el maestro ) si te unes a mi banda etc. etc. Esto es duro de ver y de comprobar emocionalmente; pero desgraciadamente es as: Lo puedes ver en los polticos, en los gurus, en los comerciales. Por que es las estructura del sistema en el que vivimos. Ahora mi Duendecito. Por que tenemos nosotros que creer  ( seres humanos) esta bolas de mentiras y enga?os que nos han metido en el alma. Cuando alguien me critica es por que tiene mas miedo que yo, por que me ataca para ganar y sentirse seguro por que gano. Pero que gano " nada" nada mas hacer mas grande su inseguridad. Ahora . mira tu pregunta, y si puedes tu misma contestarla. Descubrirs el ser maravilloso que eres y que no necesita  a nadie que te lo diga, al igual que una rosa que se abre por la ma?ana, que nadie tiene que decirle que color va atener o a que va a ole. Igual que la rosa el universo manifestando la belleza de la vida, un duende florece de felicidad.

0598aff171be5b3a01a9295637d229edaa	Its a fire sale of America. Were trying to spend our way out of trouble, which can't possibly work. The only reason it has been voted for is the drum beat of 'anyone who is against it is against creating jobs'.    Its a pork bill that will contribute to the on going destruction of the US. We have to encourage people to invest and gt ow businesses, which means lowering taxes. Instead, we think spending 1.1 trillion will have the same affect. Taking peoples money - which is what the government amounts too - is not the way to stimulate the economy.|`|GamCopDPaa	it wont at all. there is only 3 playses the govt. gets money   1. taxes  2. borrow (not gonna see much of that now)  3. print  sadly to say all of these means of getting money does not allow for a stimulus. GDP is calculated using consumer spending , govt spending, investment, and net exports. well the stimulus is: taking money from the people/borrowed money/ or printed money and giving it to the people. so they take money from u from taxes and give it back to u. so in actuality nothing is happening.  its just inflation (more money in circulation) and redistribution     EX: i tax 10 dollars i give 8 people 1 dollar and keep 2 there is still ten dollars and when its spent itll still be 10 dollars. so how can it work..... it cant    its just redistribution of wealth that is eventually going back to the govt. anyway|`|f36331383ab8dad2a7a7cbba8c28e980aa	http://readthestimulus.org/    It's not going to help anything. Contrary to popular belief, the stats do not show the New Deal ever working until the Japanese propelled the US into WWII on Dec, 7th.
603aeb442141df6dba145b00cf2a2a86aa	Honestly I think that we are in so deep that no stimulus package in all of mankind can help the economy. We owe so many countries, our deficit is horrendous...so many people are laid off. Just because somebody gets a job does not mean that they will automatically be in a good position because when you lose a job, a lot of times, even if you have severence/unemployment.. you are still digging a hole because you are not making as much as you used to.  In terms of directly to the people, I think it is 500 dollars. It is something but for a lot of people it is a drop in the bucket when you have lost your job, or trying to help a family member who has lost their job.|`|aLYwv7f3aa	Bush's bill is aimed at aiding immediately the financial sectors in hopes of stablizing that aspect of the economy as it is critical for most other sectors and businesses. (ex: Loans) With too many banks going under, it will create panic amongst regular people despite what the FDIC insures. Before the Federal Reserve was created, we had one such incident. His bill was also to save his behind for doubling our national debt to 8 trillion after that went down from 6 to 4.47 under Clinton.     People think Obama's package will fail because it aims at sectors which are not going to yield returns. They are right and wrong. Regan came in to challenge the new world economic powers and the continued fear of Russia. He boldly used our nation's money in defense and other related sectors which will not yield returns at all. For example, we keep making nuclear weapons and invest in a Star Wars program with no intentions of using or finishing, then destroy almost half of them and end the program to show sincerity of pushing for the Nuclear Armistice Treaty to Russia after they went bankrupt. So where does that leave us now with Obam's plans. A few examples here: Infrastruture projects are not going to give us one penny of interest nor a dime on ROI, but it helps place people to work immediately and creates better transportation tools which can reduce wear and tear, pollution, and fixing cost of cars. Education is another and was labeled as a dead end, but is it? Teachers are not going to give us our bang for the buck, but in this day and age where our school system are lacking quality teachers needed to get the failing kids off the streets and out of the overpopulating jails, this wasteful spending on teachers is fine by me. Better programs inspire better teachers which inspire students to be better. Renewable energy also creates jobs here NOW. We have the technology, but very few states have the capability to build the infrastructure for the long haul. In California, we lack the 6 billion extra on a 14 billion state bullet train project which will take take 100,000 cars of the road and reduce cost for passengers on travel and fuel by $2.3 billion yearly. With this money we can finish it. Anyways, these are just examples and yes most people are right as these will not yield returns, but $1 trillion wasted on American ENTIRELY is better than $1 trillion wasted on fighting and repairing infrastruture of another country we bombed the hell out of.|`|Cc6k5vJiaa	I'm thinking Obama's doing the stimulus package, knowing it shouldn't help anything, but hoping that once it passes, people will regain trust in the system and start spending more.    I don't think it's going to work.  Have you read about how many special interest programs he's giving money to?  That won't help laid off workers at all!  My dad's underemployed, my mom's out of work, and I need a loan asap, so I'm sensitive to this issue, but I just don't think it'll work...
01686ef54d7d22d6267d7be117232d9eaa	Si, durante una epoca de mi vida, dejando la adolescencia fui muy rebelde como toda jovencita, en esa epoca no me importaba nada, ni mis padres, ni mis hermanos, ni mi familia en general, fui muy egoista, y ni siquiera me preocupada si le hacia da?o a las demas personas o no con mi comportamiento.  Pero un da conoci a  una persona que me hizo ver mi suerte, una persona sin escrupulos, sin miramientos para decir y hacer las cosas, y reflexione no quise convirtirme en ella, era una mujer sin ningun tipo de sentimientos, o si los tenia sabia ocultarlos, la verdad, era fria, disciplinada, egoista, todo lo que jamas me gustaria ser a mi, despues de conocer esta persona, mi actitud comenzo a cambiar, porque no queria quedarme sola, como esa persona estaba, yo me vi en ella, a futuro y mejor cambie, comence a acercarme a mi familia y a amigos, logre recuperar la confianza de algunos de ellos y siento que valio la pena, porque gracias a esa persona, yo procure ser mejor ser humano, a interesarme mas por los demas, no solo por mi misma, a ayudar a las personas que me lo pedian, a no dejar que la sociedad se olvidara de mi, como a ella la olvidaron, no se a veces miro a esa persona y siento que bajo toda esa frialdad se esconde una buena persona, solo que ella tuvo miedo a enfrentarse a la vida y yo al principio lo tuve, pero ahora estoy convencidad de que hice bien en cambiar de actitud, ya que desde que cambie, la vida me hizo ver que estaba en un error, pero gracias a dios, ya todo esta mejorando, hasta la fe habia perdido, ahora nuevamente tengo fe y me aseguro de no volver a ser la que antes era, y tambien me aseguro de ser mejor ser humano dia con dia.|`|8772610b9c29b57a40662e6c7a369ddfaa	puff! de varias!   algunas: 1.no trabajes como esclava, nadie lo reconoce  2.no confies a la primera en la gente  3.pensa antes de hablar.

plNl3yILaa	Tough love to me is caring enough about another person to set limits with your relationship with them. It is telling it like it is not to hurt the other person but to let them know where you stand and that their responses may not be appropriate or acceptable to you. tough love to me is not taking the easy way out but to set limits so that a relationship can grow and exist with honesty, openness and an ability to grow in good health.|`|M3k9GOSsaa	I consider Tough Love to be when you do something for someone, without permission, for their "own good" or when you tell someone the honest truth about how you feel by taking action or otherwise being open to them. Such as, when a friend is doing drugs and you want them to stop. Tough Love would be telling them they have a problem and getting them help for it. The show Intervention is a classic case of "Tough Love"    It is hard to not feel guilty about giving someone your honest opinion or doing what is "best for someone", because you automatically feel that you are the one to blame for the cause of what they have to deal with. The best advice from myself would be to be 100% sure that your opinion is necessary in the situation and action needs to be taken or your opinion needs to be given.    Either way, it comes with the territory. As "love" is a four-letter word and can always be associated with pain, good and bad types.|`|l0FPw0LVaa	When you give someone the truth of a matter, purely out of love for them, allthough you know that it will hurt them and they will hate you for it for many years to come, because it will haunt them until they hopefully build up the courage and sense to address the issue.. If it ends in suicide, then I will have to deal with the guilt somehow.

As pessoas cantam "Adeus Ano Velho, Feliz Ano Novo, que tudo se realize no ano que vai nascer. Muito dinheiro no bolso, sade para dar e vender". Bem, isso  importantssimo. Com dinheiro no bolso, nesta recess?o, a grande maioria dos problemas de todo brasileiro estaria resolvido. A sade ent?o,  fundamental. N?o adianta estar com dinheiro e sem sade.    Imagine se todos seus sonhos fossem realizados no ano que vai nascer. Que maravilha! Seria o cu na terra! J pensou se sua sogra virasse um "doce" de pessoa? Se seu filho resolvesse estudar para valer e passasse de ano somente com nota 10? E seu chefe... se ele resolvesse dar aquela promo??o e consequentemente aquele aumento que voc espera h 4 anos? Hein, j pensou?    Quem j n?o pensou assim: "...esse ano vou fazer tudo o que n?o fiz ano passado". Agente faz planos e mais planos. Nos lembramos que  preciso estudar outros idiomas, se aprimorar e que  necessrio cuidar do corpo tambm (algo que facilmente nos esquecemos com o excesso de atribui??es que temos durante o ano). E por falar em atribui??es, ser que quando estivermos mais ou menos em agosto do ano que vem, vamos nos lembrar dos propsitos que tomamos no come?o do ano?    Voc j parou para refletir, por exemplo, em problemas?  lgico que sim! Todas as pessoas tm problemas! Mas se a grana diminuir ainda mais ano que vem? Como voc vai reagir? As dificuldades podem aparecer tambm em sua vida no ano que vai nascer. Ser que a "musiquinha" tradicional no reveillon vai desafinar ?    O importante  sua postura em rela??o aos altos e baixos da vida. Jesus te d a certeza de que estar ao seu lado em todos os momentos, bons ou ruins. "e certamente estarei convosco todos os dias, at a consuma??o do sculo". (Mateus 28:20) . Ele garante tambm que seremos mantidos pela sua m?o. "Eu lhes dou a vida eterna, e jamais perecer?o.."(Jo?o 10:28). Basta somente crer nele de todo cora??o. Mesmo que no prximo Ano todos seus sonhos n?o se realizem, a vitria em Deus  certa.    Se voc  do tipo de pessoa que adora fazer planos no reveillon, timo. Para alcan?armos um objetivo, precisamos primeiro idealiz-lo. Mas cuidado para n?o exagerar nos sonhos e depois n?o conseguir fazer nem mesmo a metade do que idealizou. Pe?a a orienta??o de Deus para aquilo que voc deve fazer. Ele te dar sabedoria sem medida. Essa  a grande receita para o sucesso pessoal: o encontro com Deus. Saiba que o temor de Deus  o princpio da sabedoria. Ent?o deixe-o participar ativamente da sua vida.    Imagine se todos os sonhos que temos fossem realizados? Ser que isso seria bom para ns ? Muitos sonhos que j tive posteriormente descobri que n?o seriam a melhor op??o. N?o espere que tudo se realize no ano que vai nascer, meu amigo. Deus sabe o que  melhor para voc !    Um Feliz Ano Novo. sade e felicidade!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, que esse ano seja melhor que 2006!!!!!!!!

It's happens the other way around. In fact, they feel intimidated in my presence. Their words falter and their eyes wander.    But wait, I take back my word 'intimidate'. It's a strong word, and should never have its place in a civil decent day-to-day life. I can only assure that people change in my presence - they preen, speak in a proper tone, giggle at my every quip, and in fact never fail to introduce themselves to me if we hadn't already been introduced.|`|mCAWxobNaa	Sure, when I met a friend's girlfriend, she was morbidly obese and much, much larger than me.

When a man & woman fight, he may be able to make her fearful - for a short time.    She knows she has sexist laws in her favour, and even if he did nothing wrong - at all - she can still make a false claim and be presumed honest while his life is destroyed publicly.      The fear a woman incites is one of a mental torture... knowing your kids are the snap-of-a-finger away from never seeing you - ever again. One where you know she can snap her finger and see you imprisoned on a false charge of either battery or rape. One where she snap her fingers and have you assaulted on her behalf. One where she can physically abuse you - and you are not allowed to defend yourself... and on the list goes.      Women are also quite well versed at snapping out of angry, spiteful moods the moment another person enters the room, into a dutiful likkle victim - again, just a snap of the fingers...|`|84gK4XlHaa	Most men who responded to this post have associated the word intimidation with a fear of physical violence, but I'm willing to bet that they've been intimidated in other ways.  For instance, whenever I go out to a club or party with my roommate, men just stare at her.  She's extremely pretty.  I get that, but they don't even usually try to talk her up or make a move, they just stare.  That's intimidation.  Thinking a girl is out of your league, and therefore staying away from her.  I've even seen it happen when I went to dinner with a group of guy friends.  There was an attractive woman on the other side of the restaurant, and they were all daring each other to go over and talk to her.  It's just a different kind of fear.|`|cbsAZVNQaa	yeah..back in the day I saw a girl wearing a Loraina Bobbet tshirt..I got the hell out of dodge!|`|gPtt8e0iaa	No, nothing a woman does, short of holding a gun to my head, would cause me to fear her.

I have seen women carrying on in ways that would get a man into trouble, he would just get punched but women have that advantage, they are very much protected from the harsh consequences by the old attitudes and the law.    and there is family law, someone having the power to take your house and kids away is intimidating.|`|SfPUYciIaa	I can say what I was told, and what is visible........    When a woman is dressed expensively compared to the man, that will definitely intimidate the guy. When a woman seems smarter than the man, that intimidates him too.  After it was disclosed to me that men get really intimidated when they don't have much news for you I learned that I need to under-present myself sometimes to keep the guy closer.

Those who are well-written and most vocal about it have the most influence on it, thus their opinions matter quite a bit.  An ideology doesn't exist in a vacuum and it's shaped by those who speak the loudest.  And ideology like Feminism is a living, breathing thing (unlike a constitution).|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	Rational people judge ideas on their merits as ideas.    The other thing to remember is that individuals are just that, individuals. People who share a given ideology aren't identical to each other.    But rejecting an idea because you don't like a person who promotes it is stupid.|`|vd1YIMbaaa	No because some people warp those ideologies to fit their agendas and don't represent the pure message.
pl96lkzIaa	I try to realize that even thought the things I want to happen may not happen, I still get to choose how I feel and I can be happy no matter what happens.|`|FKN9kBvLaa	Great question.  I've actually been accused of being a pessimist on several occasions, when in actuality I'm a realist.  I try to be optimistic about something if there's a 50% or higher chance of it happening.  I think its unrealistic and ultimately dangerous to believe something that has a very improbable chance of happening will.  Nothing wrong with optimism, if within reasonable probability.|`|bPKXu0oPaa	Well you can be optimistic by being happy with that you got   Yes there are probably some flaws  But rather than choosing to ignore them, hoping they'll go away, look past them or try and find ways to solve them  (: xxx
b81H0vlYaa	Hi, like you I have very vivid dreams all of the time.  I read that creative people tend to have more crazy dreams than other people.  So, I don't believe that having dark dreams means that you are depressed or stressed out(although it could), maybe you are just really artistic or intelligent.  Dreams are a combination of things.  They can help your brain sort out your daily activities and how you feel.  I also have a very painful condition, and when I am hurting, my vivid dreams turn into terrible nightmares.  If you have some type of pain or illness, this really could be contributing.      If you are really worried about this, look up something called "Lucid Dreaming" it basically tells you how you are suppose to be able to controll your dreams.  It did not work for me, though.  One of the suggestions was to write down your dreams in the morning.  I found that this took me over an hour to do, because my dreams were so detailed and long.  Then I used this website www.dreammoods.com, it could give you some type of insight to why you dream about people chasing you.     I've learned to take my dreams as a blessing.  When I wake up, it is as if I've been starring in movies all night, and getting to watch them at the same time.  The nightmares are hard to take.  I have to get up and get some water before I can truly accept that the terrible things I have just seen were only in my head, and that it was not real.  And also, that just because I dreamed this, doesn't make it come true.  I talk a lot in my sleep, and scream.  It doesn't bother me except the fact that I know I wake up my husband a lot.  But, in the end I can laugh about the weird things I said the night before to him :)    I'd like one day to have time to write down all of my dreams and write a book or movie plot with some of the better ones.|`|SFtrgKa0aa	Dreams tell us about the subconscious mind,your dreams tell me that your life is going through changes. Changes are inevitable,so try to face life as it is. Your dreams are not bad dreams like white sky is good and someone trying to knock you down is good if you see blood with it. But the drowning dream might be coz you slept with your chest down.|`|P1nVu6mmaa	Its something you did that you are running from and you have to face your worst fear or youll keep having those dreams no matter what happens just let whatever you did wrong go just let it go feel bad later or after you let it go let your emotions out and then just start thinking about everything you love before you go to sleep Try to think of all the things you love the most in alphabetical order and forget
cQNOWMktaa	Well, deep down you know that you're still a girl/guy.  The artificial body parts and surgery only make you look like a girl/guy. I'm not sure if they are functional..They can grow out their hair or get a hair cut to further adjust their new manly/womanly looks.  Most people still have the same voice after wards; for example a girl still would sound like a girl, though she can try to adjust her voice to be deeper on her own, there's no surgery for that..(At least I don't think that there is.)    Lesbian, gay, or bisexual people who can't find a lover often do this, but I don't think it's all that nice to trick someone..ah, whatever. It's not my business. Other people do it because they think that the other sex is treated better or has an easier life.    To conclude this, you only LOOK like the girl/guy that you wanted to be. You can act like them, talk like them, look like them, etc.   However, deep down you still know that you're a girl/guy..|`|9a177dad3512c5e8b08375a05676f953aa	Amazingly, this surgery is quite common (both directions) and is even covered by many health insurance plans.  I'm don't think all the "parts" are fully functional when its over, however.      The reason people do it is because they feel like they are a woman trapped inside a man's body, for example, and they just decide they don't want to live the rest of their life feeling that way.

r3gh7ho7aa	Well, generally, a restriction on trade is called a "trade restriction" because restrictions can be so vaugue or specific that I'm not sure of one term that envelopes ALL trade restrictions.      Although, an absolute trade restriction, where a country will not allow ANY trade between another counrty's gavernment is called an embargo.|`|NvcjE845aa	Barrier.|`|3p6wp7DYaa	There are several types of trade restrictions. The most extreme is called an "embargo" and it is a total cut-off of trade relations with a certain country or group of countries. There is also trade barriers that involve quotas, specific labeling requirements and other troublesome regulation. The most common trade restriction is the tariff, which is like a tax the government charges to allow imports into a country, either by unit of the good or as a percentage of its value.|`|8ea4731a729b705912f2536fb0cd0430aa	Embargo|`|MkEBvATZaa	Embargo - which is a ban on importing or exporting goods    Tariff - is a tax on imported goods

Part of a good relationship is good communication. If he can't put your mind at ease, then maybe a break is in order.     Best of luck to you|`|XIbct4fuaa	It sounds like you dont trust him.  Alot of men have fantasies about Asians, Blacks, Hispanics, Midgets, BBWs, transvestites....whatever.  Some even to the point of obsession.  But it doesnt mean he doesnt love you.  Talk to him about it.  If you really love him then you should trust him.  If you dont trust him then you two probably arent right for each other.|`|iqqQLSDDaa	I would be more concerned about the other women sending him flirty messages (regardless of race). Talk to him about how it makes you feel that he's flirting with or encouraging flirtation from other women.    As for the Asian thing...well we all have our tastes but it doesn't mean it's who we will fall in love with.    My boyfriend has a thing for redheads. I'm a brunette. He's very much in love with me.    I have a thing for dark hair and blue eyes on a guy...he's a redhead with brown eyes. And I love him.|`|d20c758729ff5fc1bce5eab1c9b36379aa	Tell him sayonara and move on with your life.

Talk to him about your feelings and then decide what's best for you.|`|0d183ab8af4fe4c2164d74294bd981adaa	I think it probably started with him fixating on kinky asian porn, and sorry but theres plenty of asian ho's on myspace, their supposedly "party promoters" but ive seen them on enough guys profiles to know their neighborhood skanks. Oh and men who love their girlfriends do not allow other women to send them flirty comments, because its disrespectful and unprofessional. Definitely dump him!|`|s3IBrhZCaa	ok, i am a white guy who is.....well, an equal opportunity lover if you know what i mean. so i think i can give you a little insight here.    a lot of white guys get an asian fetish. but let me explain something to you that might make you feel better. i think that God has given the majority of asian women a flat butt. if God gave Asian women the beautiful round butts that the Hispanic women have.......everyone would go for Asian women only. And all the rest of the women on the planet would be left out.    So you, as a Hispanic woman, have the round booty and sexy curves that no Asian woman could ever have!     This is why although I used to have an Asian fetish.....i am totally obligated and dedicated to Hispanic women. I absolutely intend on dating and marrying a hispanic woman over any other woman. I guar-an-freaking-tee it.
smHzSxcVaa	In today's society, (d) appears to be most important.  Think of high school: you may react to someone in a certain way simply because that is what others are doing.  In order to be accepted, you must follow this 'norm', despite (a), (b), and (c).  Personally, I take (c) into greatest regard when dealing with people.  I know that if the person likes me enough to show it, that I can be willing to give them a chance to make the feeling mutual.  Whereas (a) plays a big part in seeing someone's confidence, which can be a huge point in overall judgment.  Yet (b) is perhaps the deciding factor.  Ultimately, how you see someone, despite all of the other points, is what closes the deal.    Though I am not sure what context in which you are implying importance in dealing with people, this is my opinion.  I am not sure if this is what you are looking for, or if I've even answered the question accurately, but I hope it helps :)|`|UwiGwDGdaa	I think it depends upon the situation - is it an angry situation? Sad? Happy?     If I were to say something, I'd have to go with how they see themselves. How someone sees themselves often dictates their actions.

L'attitude des autres est souvent la rsultante d'expriences passes ou, au contraire du manque d'exprience. Deux petites anecdotes pour illustrer mon propos : j'ai trs souvent t baby-sitter pour la petite fille trisomique d'un couple d'amis de mes parents. L'autre jour, dans le tram de Bordeaux, je vois une petite fille trisomique, dans une poussette, et qui lui ressemblait tonnamment : mme coiffure, mmes grands yeux bleu ciel, mme babillage joyeux. Spontanment, sans rflchir, je m'agenouille et je lui parle, un peu gateuse tout  coup. La maman m'a jet un regard venimeux, comme si j'avais montr sa petite du doigt. Je n'allais pas lui raconter ma vie, donc je me suis bien sagement rassise. Seconde anecdote : j'ai travaill dans une cole primaire, dans les TOM, o une enfant trisomique tait scolarise tout  fait normalement depuis plusieurs annes, et bien entoure d'une nue de copains et copines. Elle allait avoir 16 ans et l'quipe pdagogique discutait de son devenir. Un petit gar?on, qui avait entendu toute la conversation, est venu vers moi et m'a demand si elle tait vraiment handicape. J'ai confirm. Et lui, les yeux ronds, qui s'exclame : " Moi, je croyais qu'elle venait d'un autre pays !". J'ai trouv cela dlicieusement dmonstratif des capacits des enfants  s'accepter les uns les autres si les adultes ne les pervertissent pas.

C'est compltement idiot. Mais bon, je crois que tu as raison, il faut tre honnte ; avoir du respect pour les gens, ca ne veut pas dire ignorer des diffrences qui nous touchent, nous font peur (quand on pense : ca pourrait tre moi), etc.  Ca veut dire ne pas en tenir compte, si possible.  Pareil, ne pas tre raciste, ca ne veut pas dire : ne pas remarquer que quelqu'un est noir  . Ca ne veut pas dire : faire comme si ca ne changeait absolument rien. Dsole, moi par exemple je trouve souvent les hommes noirs assez attirants, je ne peux pas ignorer ca compltement. Et puis toute la curiosit dispara?trait, celle pour une autre culture, la curiosit de l'autre en gnral.   Ne pas tre raciste ca veut dire : avoir du respect et de l'estime pour l'autre, quels que soient les "dcalages" par rapport  mon milieu social, ma race, mon corps, etc. Oui bon c'tait la ptite minute de morale, mais c'est toi qui as commenc. :-)|`|584c7b0b4b9897cd7df455d270756460aa	Tu rduis le handicap au handicap "visible" (trisomiques, ttraplgiques, etc.) ; or, le handicap ne se voit pas forcment.    Je suis moi-mme handicap (reconnu TH  80% en catgorie C par la CDAPH -ex COTOREP-, j'ai une carte d'invalidit), puisque je souffre de graves problmes digestifs (11 oprations lourdes, perfus  vie, intestin grle de 60 cm au lieu de 7-8 mtres, etc.). J'ai 27 ans, j'ai eu ?a  25 ans, et j'ai bien failli en mourir...     Mon "handicap", pourtant, personne ne le remarque quand je suis dans la rue : je ne suis ni handicap physique (je marche normalement, comme tout le monde), ni handicap mental (mon cerveau n'est pas atteint, je suis mme plut?t intelligent  ce qu'on dit) - les seuls indices "trahissant" mon tat de sant tant la prsence d'un cathter au niveau de mon paule droite et de nombreuses cicatrices dissmines un peu partout sur mon torse (bon, c'est vrai je peux plus aller  la piscine ou  la plage - ?a ne me gne pas, j'ai toujours dtest l'eau...).    Est-ce  dire que, sous prtexte que mon mal est invisible, je ne suis pas un "vrai" handicap (pourtant, mon intestin grle ne retrouvera jamais sa taille initiale...) ? Et donc, que je ne mrite pas l'attention et la considration d'autrui ?    Au nom de quoi il faudrait rserver son attention et sa considration (souvent de la "compassion" mal place) aux seules personnes dont le handicap est "visible" ??!    Le handicap prend des visages infiniment plus divers que ces seuls cas spectaculaires, il ne faut pas le rduire  la trisomie 21 ou aux ttraplgiques, unijambistes (mme si, bien s?r, je n'aimerais pas tre  leur place)...    En clair, mme une personne qui ne prsente aucun signe ostensible de handicap peut, elle aussi, potentiellement souffrir d'une affection gravement handicapante (j'en suis l'exemple vivant). Mme une personne qui n'a pas pas l'air de souffrir  premire vue, peut souffrir en ralit parfois bien plus que celle qui gmit ostensiblement (ne dit-on pas d'ailleurs que "les grands maux sont silencieux" ?)...    Raison de plus pour que chacun de nous fasse attention  chacun de nous ! Sans chercher  se donner bonne conscience - gratuitement, de manire dsintresse, sans attente de "rcompense". C'est ?a la vraie gnrosit. Rien  voir avec le compassionnel.    ;) Thanks    --------------------------------------...  Merci pour tes encouragements. Ma vie est un combat de tous les jours, car en plus de devoir grer les contraintes lies  mon handicap, il me faut faire face  d'autres coups du sort : j'ai t licenci de la fonction publique d'Etat il y a trois mois (j'tais en stage probatoire), prtend?ment pour "insuffisance professionnelle" (?a ne m'a pourtant pas empch, durant mon stage probatoire, de travailler  temps plein, malgr la gravit de mon tat de sant, ni d'accumuler pas mal d'heures supplmentaires sans demander aucune contrepartie financire  personne...).  En ralit, je suis victime d'une discrimination  l'embauche en raison de mon handicap ; une procdure judiciaire est en cours devant le tribunal administratif.    Comme quoi, il ne suffit pas de sourire  une personne handicape pour lui montrer qu'on la respecte : on rendrait un bien meilleur service  ces personnes en permettant  ceux qui sont en mesure de travailler de pouvoir vivre de leur activit professionnelle en toute autonomie, sans rien devoir  personne (bref, d'tre vritablement intgrs dans la socit, au mme titre que n'importe quelle personne "normale").  La puissance publique, si prompte  donner des le?ons en la matire (vote d'une loi instaurant une obligation d'emploi des personnes handicapes), ferait bien de se les appliquer d'abord  elle-mme !  Si les mentalits ont volu, il reste encore beaucoup de chemin  faire, malheureusement...      P.S. Dernire chose : nous pouvons tous devenir handicaps du jour au lendemain,  la suite d'un accident de la route, ou d'une maladie grave par exemple (comme moi ?a m'est arriv). C'est ainsi, la vie ne nous prvient pas.  Donc, restons humbles ; nous ne sommes pas grand chose face  ?a.|`|JT9Iov8Laa	au paravant j'avais honte de moi, et j'avais peur de m'approch d'eux je n'assum pas d'tre heureuse d'tre bien alors qu'il ya ceux qui vive mal leurs situation, mais aprs pour surmont tout cela je suis allez dans un centre de cas spciaux l ou travailler ma tante et je me suis ml a eux et cela m'a permis de voir qu'un simple geste de notre part pouver les aider a tre mieux et depuis je me sens trs alaise avec eux je n'ai plus de peine parceque j'ai le coeur en fte quand je russi a les faire sourire.  merci pour votre question elle m'a permit de mieux comprendre mes semblable souffrant partout dans le monde.|`|J7g30DzRaa	avec beaucoup de tolrance car ce sont des tre humains  part entire et qui on parfaitement le droit de vivre une existances heureuse sans moqueries et regards mchants venant d'autruit|`|1fdBhFUFaa	moi j'ai un certain respect pour eux car ils ne se cachent pas de leur handicape ... comme certains ce cachent de rien !!  je pense que les gens qui ce moquent d'eux sont egoistes car ils ne doivent pas savoir a quel point une personne handicape est courageuse et par quelles douleurs elle a d? passer pour etre l ...   je pense que leur sourire est le plus beau cadeau qu'on puisse leur offrir (un vrai sourire pas de moquerie mais de gentillesse)  bon vent toi aussi et bonne nuit ou bonne journe ^^ bises

Of course, you have to be careful of who you open up to, but try opening up to someone and you may find that, initially, they may seem narrowminded but they can be just as broadminded as you. Find someone that does not confuse you.

64b049d00e35a255db978f9f512d111eaa	"Cada uno habla de la feria segn como le va en ella"  La situacin es similar en todo el mundo pues se  estima que hay ms de trescientos sesenta millones de personas con esta enfermedad mental.  A decir del Dr,  Aguilar, la depresin ocupa el primer lugar con motivo de consulta, seguido de las vctimas de violencia y maltrato.    Adems el  alcoholismo, los intentos de suicidio y el suicidio consumado tambin tienen las cifra crecientes.    Se?al que los problemas psicosociales  como la violencia y maltrato, que son producto de las inequidades sociales, desestimulan el crecimiento y desarrollo de los ni?os, ni?as y  adolescentes.    Entre las temticas que se aborda en la capacitacin estn los conceptos de salud mental, frmaco dependencia y su tratamiento, atencin  primaria, marco social, legal y normativo del buen trato, maltrato infantil y del adolescente, maltrato escolar, definicin, clasificacin y manejo  del bebedor problema.    Estadstica    Segn datos del departamento de salud mental del MSP, entre los ecuatorianos hay altos ndices de depresin, que es una pandemia  mundial pues se calcula que hay cuatrocientos millones deprimidas en el mundo ya sea por factores endgenos por problemas en los  neurotransmisores del cerebro, otros se deprimen por factores externos como conflictos familiares o de pareja, lo que inclusive puede llevar  al suicidio.    Dentro de la epidemiologa de morbilidad a causa de enfermedades mortales hasta agosto del 2005 constan los siguientes trastornos:  depresin, victimas de violencia, epilepsia, alcoholismo, retardo mental, in-tento de suicidio, psicosis, demencia, farmacodependencia y  suicidio consumado.    Se calcula que la incidencia de las enfermedades mentales es mucho mayor porque algunas de sus manifestaciones se expresan a travs  de cuadros somticos y son atendidos como tales en las consultas externas, un caso tpico de ello son los dolores de origen desconocido  que forman parte de las llamadas depresiones enmascaradas.    Las consecuencias de estas enfermedades sobre la productividad y la calidad de vida de los ecuatorianos es muy im-portante por lo que se  les debe dar la prioridad necesaria en el campo de la salud pblica.   La sociedad nos condiciona, el mercantilismo, la publicidad en television, revistas, folletos, pelicualas, periodismo, nos meten por los ojos, que nuestra meta debe ser" TENER", de alli, la tremenda incidencia de enfermedades de presion arterial, embolias, infartos, en el trabajo improvo de las personas tratando de seguir el ezquema que nos trazaron las grandes multinacionales,somos esclavos de nuestro sistema, logramos tener a cambio dela perdida del sentido espiritual de nuestra vida, nos olvidamos de Dios, nos hacemos codiciosos, nos hacemos egoistas, nos hacemos envidiosos, nos hacemos traidores, no dudamos en meterle zancadilla al compa?ero de la oficina, con el fin de quedarnos con una mejora salarial y mejor puesto.  Por eso ahora hay nuevas enfermedades psicosomaticas como la adiccion al trabajo, las neurosis de ansiedad, los psicopatas sociales.  Nos hemos olvidado de dar, y no dar dinero precisamente, sino de ayudar, de sacar a relucir lo bueno que hay en nosotros, como es la bondad, empezando por uno mismo, siguiendo con la familia, podemos dar cari?o, podemos dar consuelo, podemos dar conocimientos, podemos dar experiencias, podemos ayudar con trabajo, podemos en fin hacer obra social, en orfanatos, asilos de ancianos, hospitales, carceles.    La necesidad es un mal, no hay necesidad de vivir bajo el imperio de la necesidad.    Epicuro de Samos (341 AC-270 AC) Filsofo griego.  As como toda carencia es desgracia, toda desgracia es carencia.    San Agustn (354-439) Obispo y filsofo.  La necesidad no conoce leyes.

dZ3rPPu2aa	Hola Hispnico!    La persona toxica es la que destila un odio visceral y se regodea con la humillacin del otro, el que avasalla al semejante, el que busca manipular con mentiras, el que agrede innecesariamente y desvaloriza al otro para sentirse bien l, el que da?a con intencin sin jams proponer una reparacin, el que incomoda con sus imposturas, el envidioso de todo lo ajeno y el que urde los problemas para acercar luego sus soluciones. La nmina de personas da?inas la completan el autodestructivo, el narcisista patolgico, el perverso, el violento impenitente y el estafador. La gente 'txica' esta encarnada por aquellos seres rapaces que inexorablemente perturban el bienestar ajeno y vampirizan al semejantes. Sus conductas se traducen en patologas, y la coexistencia con ellos resulta imposible. En el psicoanlisis y la psicologa, la literatura est dividida. No obstante, ambas se inclinan por los vnculos y comportamientos 'txicos' ms que por las personas, ya que lo que es 'txico' para unos puede ser perfectamente aceptado por otros.

Mi opinin es que esto no es cuestin de merecer o no, es tu derecho y tu lo utilizas con quien tu creas que debes exigirle, por supuesto comenzando por ti, esa es la clave del xito de tus metas y de tu personalidad. En cambio si eres todo el tiempo exigente con los dems, puede que te conviertas en una persona orgullosa,     Y la persona orgullosa es exigente con todos los que le rodean excepto consigo misma. Es incapaz de ceder y se enfada con cualquiera que le contradiga o critique. Ante cualquier enfrentamiento con los dems, el orgullo le lleva a pensar que deben ser siempre los dems los que tienen que dar el primer paso.    De pronto te conviertes en una persona intolerante, incapaz de ver las cosas desde el punto de vista de los dems.    Saldos de Roxy    |`|Xl0DOlF3aa	mira simplemente te lo voy a plantear facil.  NO LE HAGAS A LOS DEMAS LO QUE NO QUIERES QUE TE HAGAN A TI.    esa frase es muy sierta por que se debe a que todo en la vida se paga y es muy sierto lo digo con experiencia propia todo se paga no esperes irte del mundo o morir sin pagar nada por que Dios es justo y hace junticia de esa manera si quieres exigirle algo a una persona primero mirate y piensalo muy bien si, por que te pones a exigirle algo que ni tu puedes hacer esto estara muy mal.    por otra parte puedes exigir respeto eso si exigile cuantas veces quieras por que toda persona merece respeto, tambien puedes exigir disciplina para una mejor educacion y exigiur responsabilidad. si no eres respetuoso no exigas respeto, si no eres disciplinado no exigas disciplina y si no eres responsable no exigas responsabilidad.    queda en tu mente y en tu conciencia este es mi criterio no se cual sea el tuyo mucha suerte xD!!|`|YkMJPxBXaa	Mas que exigentes con los dems primero debemos ser exigentes con nosotros mismos porque no podemos exigir a los dems algo que nosotros no cumplimos o hacemos.|`|Y1fHrgH1aa	Hay que hacerse de respetar y para eso es necesario exigir respeto al prjimo, si no lo haces la gente har contigo lo que le de la gana, as es el gnero humano.

Esas obligaciones no  las aceptaba, y encima estaba encontra .  Por esto, y para que mi entorno no me "castigue" o que no me considere como "puta" pues tuve que emprender muchas "guerras"  para que me tomen en serio, y que me dejen hacer mi vida como yo la quera, por esto era muy exigente, y cuando veo algun  comportamiento legero hacia mi, pues lo denunciaba, aprovechando las ultimos cambios en la ley.   Me acuerdo, que cuando aprobaron la ley contra el acuso sexual a la mujer, me acuerdo que haba un cabron, que no acab de entender EL PORQUE estaba trabajando fuera, y el ELPORQUE estaba vestida de normal (sin velo)  y cada ma?ana se pone en mi camino, deciendo barbaridades morbosas, y acusandome con sus malos gestos .   Entonces me fue a denunciarle, y cuando le detuvieron, le hicieron una especie de entrevista, y en seguida le soltaron.  Al da seguiente, estaba otra vez en mi camino, con ms animo a acusarme.   Me fue otra vez a la comisaria, para ver porqu no lo han detenido, y sabes que me dij el inspector, me dij que "disculapalo" que "l ha prometido no acusarte ms!!"  y que "no hemos podido detenerlo porque an no sabe nada de que habia salido una ley contra el acuso!!".   Despus de esto, tuve que enviar una carta al ministerio de la justicia,  a hablar con la prensa, y a evocar el tema este en cada oportunidad que se ofreca.   Pasaron unas semanas, v a "mi" acusador, cambiando de camino nada ms al verme, con una cara de miedo aparente.

Si estamos hablando de o tomar algo que te perjudique, un poco o nada: es una buena decisin, para mi, nada (ni un poco, sobre todo segn tu autocontrol)  Si es sobre un amigo que te dice quiero que hagas todo esto y sino nada; y tu le dices que todo eso no es posible y no lo acepta; tendra que ser nada y entonces perdemos lo bueno que nos aporta y que igual no apreciamos y luego nos arrepentimos al perderlo, porque vemos que nos falta.

En el caso de que sea una adiccion, tenemos que establecer que esta adiccin es un Sndrome, el cual se define como el "Conjunto de signos y sntomas que pueden ser compartidos por varias patologas"( las cuales pueden ser narcisismo, problemas de identidad, trastornos de personalidad, sicopatias, etc, etc).  Lo que quiero decir es que no se puede dar una solucin mgica y conductista por internet a un problema del cual sabemos nada mas lo que nos explicaste en estas lineas. Lo mejor, es empezar una terapia y explorar tu inconciente con un profesional, y descubrir  las causas de tu problema desde la raiz.

Porque no creo que en un libro escrito por hombres comunes y corrientes como nosotros, slo que de otra poca, puedan tener la solucin a los problemas y la salvacin de almas.    La bibiblia que conocemos actualmente est compuesta por unos cuantos libros, de muchos que se escribieron en ese tiempo, hasta la famosa maria magdalena escribio. Pero, la iglesia conformada en su jerarqua ms alta, por hombres, centrados en ideas estrictas, solo permitieron la publicacin de unos cuantos libros, es decir, que solo se conoce a aquellos que no ponian en peligro la estabilidad de la iglesia.    La biblia siempre ha sido excluyente, piensa que antes era en latin, y solo tenian acceso a ella las familias poderosas y adineradas. Despus se utilizo como herramienta de dominacin para el pueblo, al cual se le mete la idea de no opinar diferente, de creer ciegamente, sin preguntar, ni cuestionar. Por ejemplo se sataniza a Santo Tomas con eso de "hasta no ver no creer", y lo dan como ejemplo de no actuar as.....    Y en cuanto a tu ltima pregunta, la lei en el colegio, porque esto hacia parte de la clase de religin.

La tristeza viene despus, cuando llega el desencantamiento y por alguna razn el sentimiento que antes te una a esa persona se va (por cualquier motivo que esto sea), a mi me paso que el simple hecho de escucharlo comer me daba asco... porque la imagen aquella que me hacia verlo hermoso se fue esfumando entre el ocio y los atardeceres llenos de decepcin de verlo abandonado de si mismo y lleno de egosmo su interior entonces viene la parte mas triste en la que yo fui asociando su piel y su existencia con lo feo de su interior, hasta que llego el desamor (o la decepcin) y el rechazo por su persona...

BoVwhthIaa	Mhhh imaginate que los numeros son cosmeticos de belleza.|`|txZGKVjcaa	Hola, espero sepas interpretar lo que detallar aunque estoy segura que s. Eso sucede con las " mentes brillantes" y, a pesar de que todos sufrimos diversas patologas psicologicas, no es motivo para que te alarmes al punto del pnico.  En el trastorno esquizofrnico existe una relacin entre entre ciertos dficits cognitivos ( es decir, referente al conocimiento) y las disfunciones de la conducta social, lo que provoca un "crculo vicioso" entre ambas.  Las deficiencia cognitivas (o del conocimiento) se relacionan con disfunciones de "tipo atencional" (referente a la "atencin"), y de la "informacin"; a su vez, stas disfunciones llevan a producir otras, si se quiere, ms complejas an, en la formacin de conceptos y recuperacin de la memoria. Estos dficits al mismo tiempo se interaccionan con los procesos de "atencin" e "informacin" (o representacin). En resumen, existe un "crculo vicioso" entre las funciones cognitivas: "atencin"-"representacin  informacin" ; "formacin de conceptos"- "memoria".  Por otra parte existe otro "crculo vicioso" el cual impide a la persona que adquiera  "capacidad para afrontarlo socialmente", lo que afecta las deficiencias del conocimiento.  Existen diversos programas teraputicos con la finalidad de "disminuir" los "dficits cognitivos" (o deficiencias del conocimiento) y " disfunciones de la conducta social" propios de la esquizofrenia, como ser:  --La diferenciacin entre nombres, colores, das de la semana. formas geomtricas...  --Luego, partiendo de ciertas representaciones de "escenas sociales" por un actor, el paciente (o los pacientes) debe discriminar varios "estados emocionales" e "interpretarlos".  --Seguidamente, vayamos a la "comunicacin verbal", donde los pacientes deben saber "discriminar" y hacer "peticiones verbales" adecuadas a determinadas situaciones sociales como por ejemplo, "como llevar a cabo una conversacin"  --Despus, se practica el ensayo de ciertas "habilidades sociales", como por ejemplo, pedir informacin, hacer peticiones...  --Y, finalmente, se practica el desarrollo de las habilidades sociales en el campo de la "Resolucin de problemas interpersonales"; por ejemplo,: acertijos, manejo de desacuerdos, etc.  Para completar lo antedicho, te aclaro que existen factores "genticos"; factores "sociales-culturales" (tales como el apego y desapego de los padres); factores "estresantes" y "psicolgicos", dndote como ejemplo, la predisposicin a errores en el proceso del conocimiento y la informacin que adquirimos con el tiempo;  "factores ambientales", etc.  Con fundamento, te recomiendo la terapia grupal, partiendo de lo antedicho para tu tratamiento. PROBALO- NO CUESTA NADA Y VAS A GANAR MUCHO.  TE DESEO MUCHA SUERTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!                                                             SHUSHU|`|b1Cuxbsdaa	todos son mas buenos para algo que otros, cada quien tiene su talento personal. pero si enverdad te preocupa pues entrena tu cerebro con operaciones, hay varios entrenamientos desde lo mas basico hasta lo mas dificil y asi poco a poco entrenas tu cerebro porque se dice que cuando entras a los 20 a?os el cerebro y sus funciones empiezan a deteriorarse, asi que hay que entrenarlo diario con ciertos ejercicios no puramente matematicos pero que alfinal lo son que sirven para activar el cerebro|`|eb0f199a13a599938eab81360b4ac93daa	Bueno lo que pasa es que lo de la esquizofrenia de John Nash no tiene que ver con las matemticas, eso de las matemticas es un asunto aparte, el problema que l tena era que su problema si es tratable, pero no quera seguir el tratamiento porque las drogas lo tenan todo el tiempo adormecido, le impedan desarrolar su trabajo y le causaban impotencia. entonces como el haba entendido cuales eran sus alucinaciones solo decidi ignorarlas, aunque nunca dejaron de perseguirlo.    Pero creo que lo mejor para ti sera ponerte bajo tratamiento psicolgico, ellos deben tener una mejor idea acerca de tu problema y como tratarlo.|`|F3euFREEaa	Con todo respeto te digo que necesitas ver a un mdico psiquiatra .  Es el nico que puede diagnosticar "las esquizofrenias".  Mi hermano la padece desde los 18 a?os.  El es muy brillante en casi todo....menos las matemticas.  Hoy da y tomada a tiempo se puede controlar.Tanto las alucinaciones auditivas como las visuales.  Puede ser que ests confundido o con pnico.  De todas formas lo mejor ..es hacer la consulta a tiempo.    Es un trastorno mental en el cual es difcil para la persona diferenciar entre experiencias reales e irreales, pensar de manera lgica, tener respuestas emocionales normales ante los dems y comportarse normalmente en situaciones sociales.  Las personas con esquizofrenia pueden tener una variedad de sntomas. Por lo general, la enfermedad se desarrolla lentamente durante meses e incluso a?os. Inicialmente, los sntomas pueden ser imperceptibles; por ejemplo la persona puede sentirse tensa, tener problemas para dormir o tener problemas de concentracin. Las personas se vuelven aisladas y retradas, no hacen ni conservan amistades. A medida que la enfermedad progresa se presentan sntomas psicticos como:        * Delirios: creencias o pensamientos falsos sin fundamento real      * Alucinaciones: escuchar, ver o sentir cosas que no estn presentes      * Pensamiento desordenado: "saltos" de pensamiento entre tpicos totalmente inconexos; la persona puede hablar incoherencias      * Comportamiento catatnico: comportamiento motor extra?o marcado por una disminucin de la reaccin al entorno o hiperactividad que no guarda relacin con el estmulo      * Afecto plano: una apariencia o estado de nimo que no refleja emocin alguna    No hay una caracterstica nica que est presente en todos los tipos de esquizofrenia. Los factores de riesgo comprenden antecedentes familiares de esquizofrenia. Se cree que la esquizofrenia afecta alrededor del 1% de la poblacin en el mundo y parece presentarse en promedios iguales entre hombre y mujeres, pero las mujeres tienen un inicio ms tardo, por esta razn los hombres tienden a sumar ms de la mitad de los pacientes en los servicios con una elevada proporcin de adultos jvenes. Aunque el inicio de la esquizofrenia prcticamente  se presenta a principios de la edad adulta, se conocen casos del trastorno con inicio tardo (ms de 45 a?os).  Los medicamentos antipsicticos o neurolpticos funcionan cambiando el equilibrio de qumicos en el cerebro y se usan para controlar los sntomas de la enfermedad. Estos medicamentos son efectivos pero tambin estn asociados con efectos secundarios que pueden desmotivar al paciente para tomarlos con regularidad. Sin embargo, muchos de estos efectos secundarios pueden tratarse y no deben ser motivo para evitar buscar tratamiento para este serio trastorno.  Espero haber ayudado en algo.  Cudate mucho.  te dejo un beso y una estrella.|`|d6ZBAsrAaa	Te entiendo... yo tengo que estar laaaaaaaaaaaaargaaaaaaaassssssss horas para entender calculos...

7xuzqTRxaa	El oto?o sin duda es una especie de catarsis en la naturaleza, significa el fin de algo viejo y el renacer de algo nuevo y mejor. Siempre es lindo mirar como los arboles pierden sus hojas y las plantas se secan hasta el punto de que parece todo ha muerto, y luego en primavera todo vuelve a nacer, los arboles y las plantas recuperan sus colores, es el inicio de una nueva vida.  Los seres humanos tambin atravesamos etapas como esta en las que nos deshacemos de todo aquello que ya no necesitamos, eso que no nos gusta o ya no nos satisface, y cambiamos, para empezar de nuevo, para mejorar, para sentirnos bien de nuevo, para volver a experimentar nuevas sensaciones.   Cuando realmente logras hacer una cambio espiritual es cuando mejor te sientes con vos mismo, es como una renovacin interna, en donde te detienes, miras hacia el pasado y luego hacia el futuro y decides qu de todo lo que has logrado te ha hecho bien y quieres llevar con vos, y qu ya no es necesario, de ese modo le damos lugar a lo nuevo y prometedor.  El cambio total siempre es liberador, uno se siente libre, liviano, nos renueva y llena de energa.  Saludos!|`|3f6750a0113a12d6422daf9c9c454a30aa	El oto?o y el ocaso me inspiran lo mismo.

Bien ahora comparemos el amor con la pareja estable y con la o el amante, existe una gran diferencia.. solo que en todos estos ltimos entra la sexualidad... y no confundamos amor con calentura.

A mi me entusiasma mucho el amor ertico,,,pero no quisiera parecer procaz en mi decir, y por eso prefiero no ahondar mucho en un tpico tan algido.Los Griegos utilizaban tres palabras/conceptos para referisrse al amor,,,ya ves que a ellos no les alcanzaba con un solo significante.Eros (amor ertico)Agape(amor divino)philia (amor fraterno,,,de la fratria). Por eso segn mi humilde entender,,,, amor hay amores. Como me place llamarlo,,, el partenaire/otro del amor,,, es de alguna manera objeto de nuestra libidinal investidura,,,de manera que en sus reales encantos,,, lo  hacemos prenda de nuestro particular inters,,,para reconocernos en l y brindarle sostn a  la vez que recibirlo.Es difcil sostener esto en el tiempo, sin un pacto, de manera que es preciso renovarle con atenciones nuestro decir con hechos, para que pueda sentirse vigente. No creo en el amor eterno,,si creo en lo que Fromm expresa realcionado a que es preferible amar a ser amado,,,Gracias,,, Orlando|`|4821d4b7fd50007f7a9589446be624cfaa	No existe el objeto amoroso. Ser urpico pero yo prefiero pensar en sujetos a la hora de ese encuentro tan fundamental, tan inevitable como la vida o la muerte.|`|HaO8Vxz3aa	Estoy de acuerdo con las otras personas, eso de objetos amorosos no va.  Un objeto es un carro, una silla, un telefono, una casa, etc, etc.  Entonces el amor no es un objeto.  Y si hay diferentes tipos de amor, pero en mi opinion el mas importante es el amor que nos tengamos nosotros mismos... para asi poder compartir ese amor con el resto de la humanidad.|`|HdTJ2Jtpaa	Es lamentable, que , en esta poca moderna, al decir amor, tengas que aclarar que no estas hablando de sexo , se esta confundiendo el idioma , ya casi no hay modo de decir las palabras, que  enseguida lo conectan a eso, hay muchisimas clases de amor , incluso a los objetos, en su verdadera acepcin por eso muchos no dejas su barrio, aunque vivan mal, aunque tengan posibilidades de sitios mejores , muchisimos aman tanto su casa, que si deben mudarse , mueren de tristeza, !!  los que aman su auto mas que a su familia ! !  los enamorados de sus mascotas, ? alguien recuerda al loro que se diputaban en los tribunales cordobeses?  Ya se que hablabas del amor fraterno , y del amistoso , solo pongo ejemplos de otra clase de amores.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Que estoy totalmente de acuerdo contigo. Te falt decir que existe el amor a la familia, a los hijos, a las mascotas, a tu hogar, a tu tierra, a tu idioma, a tu pueblo, etc...|`|43b73829c8ee958f3da9e1e8f2a7d117aa	Me quedo con la frase de Fromm. Y es que el lenguaje se presta a confusiones.Confundimos el amar con el querer. y el amor es un sentimiento mucho ms universal. E invirtiendo los trminos de la frase de Erich, podramos decir o preguntarnos:  ?Si no amo a los dems cmo me puedo amar a mi mismo?   Curioso que todas estas cosas ya las dijera Jesucristo.  En cuanto el "querer", lo que pienso es que lo utilizamos en lenguaje coloquial como una muestra de cari?o  y de amor en particular, pero podemos encontrarnos con la sorpresa de que si le decimos a alguien que "LE QUEREMOS" nos pueda responder : Y para qu me quieres. El verbo amar puede estar completo en si mismo en cuanto a su significado.el verbo querer tal vez necesita un qu y un para qu para completarse. tal vez tiene ese matiz utilitarista que el verbo amar no tiene y un sentido que implica ambivalencia, ya que querremos en cuanto lo que queremos nos satisfaga y dejaremos de querer en cuanto nos frustre.|`|tJlaZYrJaa	Para mi NO hay diversos tipos de Amor, el AMOR es UNIKO, se distigue por la profundidad de los sentimientos, es lo ke marka la diferencia.  Y perdona amiga pero, ke feo suena "objeto amoroso".    Un Kari?ote|`|17dead0ee678a04cc4e5b47e1c6e23c9aa	yo pienso parecido pero no igual sera que me gustan todas

Es cierto que lo del "desabastecimiento" es un trmino relativo: desabastecimiento vivi un conocida ma que se vino de Ucrania con su esposo, ambos mdicos, porque en un mal invierno, el pueblo donde vivan se qued sin  nada, y se comieron hasta los perros, literalmente.  Por supuesto que los porte?os nos ahogamos en un vaso de agua. Los que vivimos en otro mundo somos nosotros, hasta dira que hay tambin dos ciudades.

Esto es muy grave y se encrgaron de fracturar el pas en 2, me hace acordar como tiempos anteriores...  Que gobiernen para la Argentina de hoy!!!  Y lo mas importante es que tengamos lo necesrio para vivir, pero que haya paz entre los argentinos....

5mut0CVsaa	Te soy honesta, Noemi. Me siento incapacitada para opinar con ciencia y me niego a hablarte de "todo depende del cristal con que se lo mire" porque entiendo que va mas alla. Te doy una opinion chiquita, a ver si te entendi. Existe un convencionalismo para las cosas, una definicion "de lejos", gracias a lo que todo puede ser nombrado y tipificado, y que crea una tela simbolica que permite comunicarnos con un idioma comun. Pero a medida que la individualidad se acerca a esa "cosa" y la autodefine con sus propios condicionantes, esta cambia y termina por definir a quien define. Era mas o menos eso? Mira que tuve que ser valiente para participar. Un beso.|`|431e34e2f14b412d414acbbf517bf23caa	Noe te has venido muy filosfica hoy, y yo regreso de unas minivacaciones muy tranqui, tengo que entrar en ritmo.

Esto da miedo,,,te van a rep,,,,, ja ja ja.Que puedo decir yo,,,coincido plenamente,,,nadie podra,,, excepto Lacan,,, ja ja ja ja,,,decirlo mejor. "El inconsciente como Otro est estructurado como un lenguaje",,,, ergo nuestra percepcin del mundo,,,esta estructurada en significantes. Los significantes son como chips,,,se abren como mundos particulares,,,es decir son mucho ms complejos que los chips.Hay tantas lecturas del mundo como articulacin de esos significantes,,,y cada uno de nosotros,,, es una particular variedad. Por eso,,,"La verdad tiene carcter de ficcin"(Lacan dixit) " Yo la verdad hablo"(Lacan dixit),,, el mundo humano es discursivo,,,no lo sabe.

ac7fd0a2aca5a7a3c665be6635f27180aa	Noe:    Yo tengo una frase clebre que siempre la digo "doy clases de humildad y gratis..." jajaja.    Ahora en serio, en la vida aprend que hasta el ltimo de mis das voy a aprender algo nuevo, cada da solamente ten en cuenta nos ense?a a vivir un da ms, a conocer algo ms alguien ms....  Lo que puedo ense?ar no es mucho pero si servir de ejemplo para algn otro y en especial para mis hijos, mis hijos aprenderan de mis ense?anzas ya sea para hacer o no hacer lo que les he dicho. Ellos sabrn descifrar con el tiempo si mis ense?anzas fueron correctas o me equivoqu !!!  Siempre nos toca ense?ar, poco o mucho, acertado o deshacertado, pero siempre dejamos cada uno, nuestra peque?a huella marcada en este corto pasar por la vida...  Un beso.|`|fbopOGl3aa	Querida amiga, como sabes fui maestra toda mi vida, de modo que me fascina ense?ar y aprender. me encantara ser la eterna estudiante, siempre aprendiendo cosas nuevas.  Un beso enorme|`|9e4e760246bbae7f3ff20e0d87a59484aa	Solo si los que quieren aprender, me lo piden, si no, ni lo intento, en cuanto a ense?ar; y en cuanto a aprender, siempre me lo permito.|`|oJh6CLDDaa	Una excelente pregunta, Noem.    Evdiencia que hasta el maestro puede aprender de sus alumnos (suponiendo que se crea saber mucho).    Pero sobre todas las cosas, que hay que mantenerse con la mente abierta y actitud bien predispuesta a dar y recibir lo mejor de cada uno, sin prejuzgar a la ligera, como es tendencia natural de los humanos.    Es comn enterarse (o que nos pase) de que la "inocente" pregunta de un ni?o, nos obligue a reflexiones profundas y darnos cuenta de algn detalle el cual, a veces durante a?os, repetimos de modo inconsciente, dando por supuesto que "as debe ser" o "es lo correcto".|`|tJlaZYrJaa	Totalmente.   Tal vez no tanto ense?ar, si, kompartir, tener la kapacidad de akonsejar desde una opinin  experiencia, NO dar konsejos, nos da la oportunidad de ayudar y tal vez, mostrar una se?al en un kaminio deskonocido.  Siempre es positivo y necesario seguir aprendiendo, a toda edad, krecer da a da nos fortalece y nos hace mas persona.  Kien kree saber y konocer todo, aun no deskubrio el SER.|`|EwsDL8mEaa	me encanto esa frase. abarca mucho me parece no solo desde el punto de vista intelectual sino lo que se aprende tambien desde el punto de vista humano|`|VtMCgXtzaa	HOLA???...OBVIO...YA QUE SINO,NO SERIA NADA NI NADIE....

Trato de ense?ar cuando me piden sobre algo que la vida me haya dado la oportunidad de bien saber, y por supuesto aprendo da con da algo nuevo, porque el saber no termina jams.  Saludos.|`|KM5iahiSaa	Claro, espero usar lo poco que se tratar de aprender lo mucho que no se. Por ejemplo hace poco cuando termine el secundario haba un proyecto en el cual teniamos que dise?ar y dar un curso de introduccion a la Informatica. Saludos|`|007ae7aca0afa374d46f0de02760c916aa	Hola Noemi!  Cada momento aprendo cosas nuevas! De todos, de mis padres, de mis hijos, hasta de mi nietito aprendo la alegria de descubrir en cada cosa  el mundo!!!    Aprendi en este ultimo tiempo que la amistad trasciende lo fisico y las distancias, paso horas leyendo como piensan personas de distintas edades y lugares y de ellas tambien aprendo!    Y en cuanto a ense?ar....lo que mas me interesa es contar que en  cada momento de la vida uno puede decidir ser feliz o no ...Y vale la pena ser feliz!!!!|`|mCT60hRRaa	Cuando uno advierte la complejidad,,,a resultas de ser hablantes,,,y las brechas que el significante abre en lo real,,,lo cual no pocas consecuencias nos produce, en nuestra complicada relacin con el saber. La conocida frase de Scrates,,,recobra todo su valor, de ser una de las ms lcidas sentencias, que los siglos honran, guardandola como un tesoro de la verdad en relacin a l." Slo se,,,que nada se". De manera que aprender es lo constante del saber,,,es su cara ms genuina,,,ya que ense?ar, slo los que no se la creen, llegan a mostrarnos,,,que es en una trasmisin de trabajo,,,como algo del saber /hacer, podemos construir,,,en relacin a un tiempo que es el que nos toca vivir. Es una reflexin que me ha surgido, mientras a mano alzada escriba, una posible respuesta a tu maravillosa pregunta. Un abrazo,,, Orlando.|`|gDxlJJYraa	Ense?o todo lo que puedo pero no me alcanzar la vida para aprender todo lo que s de su existencia e ignoro, puesto que el conocimiento a adquirir es infinitamente ms grande y crece continuamente, al contrario de lo que uno pueda haber aprendido.|`|RccTSNTDaa	Si ........ es para mi una agradable obsesin ............|`|HdTJ2Jtpaa	,intento ense?ar lo poco que se, pero no intento aprender lo mucho que no se, solo aquello que me sea imprescindible e interesante ,nada de matemticas , geografa  , ni filosofa ni elucubraciones cientficas etc, etc etc.|`|JCFqz29yaa	Me siento aprendiz de todo y maestro de nada, pues la vida da a da te va ense?ando cosas nuevas.Las que no te ense?a la vida las conozco y aprendo con todos vosotros, de vuestras preguntas y de las respuestas.

Ces mots qui, en les crivant, me font pleurer, soit de tristesse, de colre ou de joie.    Ces mots qui contiennent parfois mes maux et qui font trembler mon corps et ma voix.    Ces mots, je te les offre par crit pour que tu puisses conna?tre ce que mon coeur a  te dire...    Ces maux, je les ''garroche'' sur la feuille blanche pour que plus jamais ils ne viennent perturber mes penses...    Ces maux jets dans un tourbillon d'motion sur la feuille blanche me permettront de mettre des mots un  c?t de l'autre pour enfin t'exprimer ce qui me br?le, ce qui me hante, ce qui m'enchante ou ce qui me passionne.

El fin para lo que lo utilice cada uno no lo define.|`|uNUdV2znaa	Cada silencio tiene un por qu y una funcin:    *Los que estn en grupo y solo escuchan hablar a los dems, callan por timidez. O porque no se sienten a gusto con el tema a discutir.    *Los que callan por miedo a algo o alguien, son los pusilnimes, cobardes y sin valor para enfrentar la verdad.    *Los que callan cuando no tienen nada bueno que decir, son inteligentes y reservados, porque es mejor no decir nada sin una idea elaborada en mente.    A veces un silencio oportuno es ms elocuente que un discurso, pero tiene su momento.    Antes de callar o hablar, se necesita pensar.|`|9gaYCNU9aa	El silencio es para m:  -La capacidad de volar sin alas,  -La capacidad de caminar sin pies,  -La capacidad de observar sin perturbar,  -La capacidad de escuchar sin interrumpir,  -La capacidad de palpar sin crear incomodidad.  -La capacidad de disfrutar la flor sin robarle su aroma.    Creo que el silencio es muy impotante en algunas etapas de nuestra vida, porque sin el silencio nuestra alma no tiene claridad, no tiene luz.    Yo necesito del silencio para centra nuevamente mi vida y olvidar algunos episodios dolorosos. No uso el silencio como antesala a una venganza (eso sera una  traicin). Simplemente dejo que el silencio me invada para conseguir la calma que necesito.    Saludos amigo.....?Felices Fiestas!!

But I know there are quite a few hippies wearing suits and ties with multi-billion dollar stocks in Celestial Seasoning tea for instance. If our values are to help clean up the environment and look for alternative fuel then, please brand me a hippie. Hell, bell bottoms were back in style recently weren't they?   I'm a Viet Nam vet but I think that makes me good hippie because I griped about having to go there tried not to kill anybody....(that's a diff. subject)    But anyway, it's non-violent, anti-war hippie values in a sense as Dems. try to pass an Iraq war resolution in congress.  Yes, I think there are a quite a few hippies, with hippie values. Or Democrats wouldn't control the house. PEACE|`|AA11120822	I think that there are a lot more people turning back to that way of thinking now that we're fighting another pointless, unwinable foreign war. And you see that concern about global warming is becoming mainstream now when just a couple of years ago it was kind of considered a fringe, radical idea.  I'd like to think that more Americans are finally waking up and getting in touch with what's happening in the world around them.|`|AA10941574	We still have hippies in San Francisco.  Actually alot of what they claim to have stood for has actually seeped into multiple aspects of pop culture.  Sorta like their music.  It was the seed from which a variety of things grew.|`|AA10691483	I'm sure there are many hippies still roaming the earth, even though they may now look different, i.e., without the bellbottoms, long hair, beads and what not. The may have joined the 'establishment' and still think the same. I'm sure there are other 'hippie' thinkers that are younger, but are known by different names. That type of thinking will never die out. The music of the hippies is still alive and well: psychedelic rock, protest songs, etc.

No ,no se puede conseguir amor si no demostras que ests interesado en el mismo porque amor con amor se paga  pero tendia que ser...darle amor al desamorado que es quien mas lo necesita ?no?    saludo?|`|453222ae5387f9d197b91dd69f8d2eb3aa	Por supuesto, ?has odo hablar de amores no correspondidos? no hay mejor muestra.    ?por qu? porque amar es un acto unilateral.      Es posible que tu amor, termine provocando amor en el otro o en otros, o bien, que por mera coincidencia, surja el amor de manera espontnea en dos personas de manera recproca (amor a primera vista).  Otros surgen a destiempo; cuando uno comienza a amar, el otro ya lo olvid.      En fin, el amor es muy complejo.|`|3c30415ed271c6f227383fd142b40126aa	No, porque aunque alguien se enamore de ti y no sea correspondida, ella no tendr tu amor, y porque para dar hay que recibir y viceversa...se recoge lo que se seimbra...y si solo da uno, el otro se termina por cansar....besitos!|`|jtbPeoqDaa	si el amor esta tan maltratado y faltante de amor que si|`|E0JFPqxRaa	si porque la otra persona puede amar y demostrarlo por los dos (pero nunca acaba bien)|`|Sem0lFC3aa	claro un hombre que esta enamorado jamas le dice a su mujer que la ama por que piensa que ella ya tiene que saberlo un hombre enamorado no tiene que demostrar amor|`|Jw4P2NWSaa	Si. Porque se confunden muchas veces la atencin, el cari?o,con amor, y otras porque hay quien se deja querer aunque a esa persona no la ame.|`|1Owo6nDTaa	si puede pasar.   muchas veces hay amores no correspondidos, te quieren pero vos no sabes ni que estaban ah.|`|fFYdgJzIaa	Si, pero no lo sabrs disfrutar, pues el amor tiene que ser visceral y  cuando sentido de forma recproca genera una energa que produce una explosin de los sentidos que si es unilateral no lo puedes captar. Un beso, y ama mucho y demuestralo ms.|`|XG1VxPG8aa	Si, te pueden amar aunque tu no des amor, la razn es un misterio, pero es que a veces, el amor no es reciproco.    Saludos, amigo.|`|kJreIS1Daa	No.    Porque para que alguien te quiera, o te ame, primero has tenido que demostrar t algo:    -un detalle    -una muestra de afecto    -una sonrisa dulce y sincera.|`|JBPcDC9Xaa	Mira sinceramente como psicologa te puedo decir que no, es ilusin, es capricho, obsecin, repeticin de roles (lo que vimos en casa creemos que es lo correcto) etc. etc etc.  Como mujer te puedo decir que mucha veces nos sejamos de la manera ms profunda que puede haber y creemos amar y creemos que as es el amor, y que el o ella da lo que puede y no importa esta la frase que dice"con mi amor basta para unir mi noviazgo, mi matrimonio, mi vida junto a el" erroooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr es el ms grande que cometemos el pensar que lo que resivimos merecemos, que si resivimos golpes,  mal tratato infidelidades, avandono, groserias, desplantes etc etc ya seas hombre o mujer es porque as ama esa persona y que en el fondo nos ama.... esto es simplemente sumsion, y el amor no es as, todos pasamos alguna vez en la vida por un enamoramiento (direrente al amor real) en el que creemos esto es algo dificil darnos cuenta y ahora en la actualidad hay gente que no se da cuenta que tiene derecho a resivir lo que das y tienes a que te demuestren que les importas y a resivir afecto.  EL AMOR NACE ENTRE DOS PERSONAS QUE DESEAN, QUIEREN, PIENSAN Y TIENEN LA CONVICCIN DE ESTAR JUNTOS, POR ALGUN TIEMPO, POR ALGOS A?OS, POR TODA LA VIDA...... y que s al final de ese tiempo se llegan a separar, ese amor habra sido lindo y quedan los ms bellos rescuerdos.....porque fue mutuo....|`|TX5zBzhdaa	hay personas k se enamoran de ti sin k las ames.|`|duQckQTpaa	no pk toda accion tiene su reaccion para recibir has de dar  siembra y recojeras|`|mjIwxgRwaa	Si, porque la gente esta sedienta de amor y muchas de ellas no necesitan que les demuestres que las amas, ellas simplemente te lo ofrecen de manera desinteresada, ademas la gente a tu alrededor puede muchas veces llegar a ver la calidad de tu persona aunque tu mismo no tengas ese concepto sobre ti mismo...mucha gente a falta de amor, lo regala a manos llenas y se termina amando a quien no lo merece porque simplemente ni siquiera lo quiere recibir|`|9dhlpAEXaa	Si se puede conseguir hay gente que se puede enamorar de ti por tus cualidades aunque no le demuestres tu amor, pero si la amas y solo no quieres demostrarselo por miedo que horror no hay nada peor que reprimirse y no disfrutar lo que sientes.|`|wotbc0MRaa	Al igual y si existe esa posibilidad pero creo que en mi opinin prefiero que se demuestres por que si no entonces creo que no tiene sentido.|`|fzf9TnThaa	ORALE, PALABRAS FUERTES.    El amor psicolgicamente hace que las personas no persivan su entorno tal cual es y mucho menos que analicen la situacin de sus compa?eros cuando estos son amados por l, es as como nuestos lazos humanos nos llevan a tener relaciones personales con aquellos que no busquen necesariamente nuestro amor.    Por ejemplo, es dficil que los padre desprecien a sus hijos, por el hecho de que su psicologa est encamianda a apoyar a su propia sangre haciendo que el juicio haca un ser amado no sea el mismo que tomarn las personas que no tienen una relacin afn.    As es que si alguien te quiere ser ms facil que esa persona omita o no vea tus defectos, sino que trate de justificarlos y ha tendrs un aliado.    Ya sabes, si alguin te quiere no te aproveches, pues No es necesario que t des algo para recibir amor. Muestras de que has recibido amor sin pedirlo es la vida, el amor de quienes no te conocen y se preocupan por t etc...    CONCLUSIN: S puedes recibir amor sin que t demuestres algo.|`|msWMWoWtaa	PUEDES ENTRAR A UN TRABAJO SIN DEMOSTRAR TU TALENTO?

BoVwhthIaa	Hola nena! mira por principio de cuentas todo tiene solucion en esta vida absolutamente todo ok?? mi mam tambien es una persona alcoholica aunque ya tiene como 10 a?os que no bebe ni una gota sigue siendo alcoholica toda su vida.  Dejame decirte algo, un alcoholico lo que necesita es una razon muy fuerte y muy convincente para aceptar que es un enfermo alcoholico y aceptar que necesita ayuda de otra manera pensar que lo que le dicen los supuestos alcoholicas y personas que se quieren acercar a ella son puras tonterias y que lo a que a ella le pasa nadie pero nadie puede quitarselo.  Te entiendo, creeme,. ver a tu mami tomada yo la llegue a ver muchas veces siendo ni?o en su cama y no comprendia lo que pasaba o por que lo hacia, recuerdo que me sentaba junto a ella y le decia ya no tomes ma te hace da?o, y ella no me hacia caso siendo yo su hijo que se supone el pilar la fuerza para que dejara la bebida. Hasta que un dia unas personas de AA fueron a mi casa y le ofrecieron ayuda, y la llevaron a un grupo, eso fue hace 10 a?os gracias a Dios y cada a?o le festejamos su aniversario todos muy contentos, llevamos pastel y comida y refrescos para los invitados de lo cual no me da pena ni me averguenzo.  El unico requisito para estar en AA y que tu mama pueda pertenecer en el, es el deseo de dejar la bebida.  De ahi en fuera es lo unico que necesita, que ella quiera aceptar la ayuda y decir ya no quiero seguir bebiendo ya no quiero que me vean asi, quiero dejar de sufrir en ese momento AA es la salvacion y su total recuperacion.  Entonces convence a tu mami de ir a un grupo de AA y que vayan juntas pidan ayuda  con un familiar o amigo cercano o gente de AA en el grupo de tu comunidad para que asista a juntas de informacion donde hay mujeres como ella dando testimonio de como han llevado su recuperacion, no te preocupues chiquita yo s como te sientes, pero es por falta de conocimiento de que necesita tu mami decir deseo dejar de tomar.    Ok ?? aqui estaremos para ayudarte si lo requieres.    Echale ganas y ojala vayan a un grupo|`|e4c865940478da11bc3174ef3c7a1629aa	Es como la depresion|`|4ff1f8b96beb8f12f92868207318e05eaa	Estn hundidos en un pozo. beben para sentirse mejor y lo consiguen, pero cuando se les pasa el efecto necesitan ms.  Si no beben les entran temblores por eso acaban tomando en las ma?anas.  Hasta que tu mam no reconozca que tiene un problema lo nico que puedes hacer es cuidarte tu. De nuevo, acude t a ALANON, as le sers de ayuda cuando ella est preparada, pero puede que pasen muchos a?os...  ALANON tiene una rama para adolescentes familiares de alcohlicos, quizas se ms apropiado. Se llama ALATEEN|`|gd7E8ylaaa	el problema radica en que no podemos ayudar a la persona alcohlica si no quiere recibir ningn tipo de ayuda. No se la puede forzar, es intil, lamentablemente.|`|ZiQIwHaTaa	Bueno x dicha nunk he pasado x esos momentos pero pienso q usan el alcohol cm medio para olvidar las penas pero..si cn cada problema nos tomamos una lata de cerveza imaginese cm se va ir formando ese alcoholismo y vicio?|`|ouWy2J5Oaa	Diferimos, digo... difieren.|`|2860db808f1e0069297ed791c93abc5eaa	generalmente estando alcoholizado los sentimientos no cuentan ya que pueden pasar de un estado tranquilo a uno euforico.  Lo ideal seria hablar con la  persona en la ma?ana cuando la borrachera ya no esta. Asi contarle a ella el da?o que se hace y que le hace a toda su familia..  Intentar tocar una fibra intima y asi poder ayudarlo a recapacitar de la enfermedad que lleva consigo.

n09IHIqmaa	I cannot  express enough how you and your husband  need to get good counseling.  He has not been a good communicator to you and you have allowed him to sabotage your desires and dreams to have child.  Something in your relationship has got to give, and though it is possible to continue in a relationship without closure from a past hurt,  I personally I don't think it's possible to  "move on".   When he tells you to stop talking about the past it's because he is not willing to hear you out and how being childless has affected you.  After all, this would make him have to face a truth in there somewhere.  Not talking about this issue means he hopes it will just go away.  Trust me, this is an issue that will fester up, not go away, and you'll end up bitter.  If he won't go to counseling with you, then go by yourself.  You say he is a good man.  If he truly is a good man and he loves you, he will put himself aside and go the distance with you.  You deserve to have your dreams met, and getting counseling will empower you and enable you to handle this issue with your husband in the best way possible.  Good luck!|`|K2QKWja5aa	Possible, yes. It is up to you to forgive,   Probable,no. A child is the gift of two people, to each other.  He should have been honest. Can you still have a baby?  Then maybe it is more probable than I think. Speak to each other. If he doesn't come round maybe you still have time with someone else. Your choice. Not his.|`|UwBxMW63aa	We don't know if you subsequently did have a child or even if your biological clock has been turned off yet.  These are key bits of info.    You have to get over your problem of his inability to deal with YOUR truth.   It's easy to sit in judgment of some callous bastard who made your life unpleasant even though you excuse him with "My husband is a good man".  It's obvious to me he is not and wasn't so for many years.    Regardless, Forgiveness (on your part), is giving up all hope for a better past.  That is, nothing of the past can be changed BUT you can change your future ... he could consider trying to make you feel good after years of treating you like garbage - sounds like he's still doing it.  A Psychologist would classify his current 'actions' as 'passive aggression'.  Good luck. :)|`|c9ef2b0b2e7a35713e6d8d96de58a9dcaa	Is he sure about your marriage now?  Can you not have children now?  Did you marry him knowing he didn't want children?    It is totally normal to feel hurt and it not go away right away.  The only way it goes away is with time and forgiveness.  We have to learn from our past and pains we go through.  It's your decision to live the rest of your life happily or miserable.  No one else's decision but your own.|`|b75dbd01af66bee33c67e5f1c4fe6608aa	Did he sabotage your dream, Or did he make his feelings on having children clear to you when you first were married?  I only ask because sometimes we hear what we want to hear, or at the very least believe that at some point we will be able to change the other persons mind.  At the very least you have to ask yourself did he not confront the issue directly out of malice. or out of the desire not to hurt you ?|`|dYOf8zlvaa	I believe that you're correct in feeling deceived.  Your husband is alright with moving forward because he's been aware of the real situation all along- he knew how uncertain he was of things.  You, however, were unjustly kept in the dark about his misgivings, and are just now being hit with the bomb of learning that everything you've trusted in was being questioned in his heart...  It's great that you can say that he's a good man.  That means that you've still got a good foundation to build on.  He's got to realize that your foundation was shaken by this revelation, though.    Jeopardizing your dreams of a family shows an even more sinister reluctance to face the truth.  Concerning something so important to you, he should have brought his thoughts into the light so they could be addressed, rather than manipulating circumstances to keep you from getting pregnant and therefore allowing him to continue not to face his doubts about the relationship.  I would recommend that you find a counselor that can assist your husband in seeing how damaging this was to you, and give you both some help in how to work out things better as your marriage continues.  Marriage is about give and take, continuing to compromise and support one another on your journey together.    By hiding his misgivings about your relationship, your husband was doing anything but.  Maybe he didn't have the courage to possibly hurt your feelings, maybe he didn't want to cause arguments or fighting and didn't want to 'rock the boat'.  Whatever the reason, it wasn't the right thing to do, and your relationship would probably be helped by working out how to prevent this from happening again in the future.|`|y6XUCAv2aa	that is such a typical answer from a man.  they do not feel things like we do.  Lighten up, get over it- much easier said then done.  Tell him you will stop talking about the past if he will put in a little effort to help you resolve your feelings.  How did you live with him so long and have no clue how he felt? I understand you feeling lack of trust if he "acted one way, but felt another way" it is very hard to trust someone that you do not feel is honest with their feelings. Did he somehow trick you? How did he keep you from becoming pregnant.  If it was something that he did behind your back that you were clueless over then he did not give you a choice of staying with him versus moving on if a having a child was that important to you. You will have resentments towards him for the rest of your life if you do not come to some resolution.  Either get him to go to a few sessions with a well recommended marriage counsler to discuss this, go to a therapist yourself to see how to deal with it.  If he will  not do anything to give you closure, then you will have to make a decision to accept that this who he is, not who you want or imagine him to be.  And either accept him for who he is and love him or move on.  You cannot change what has already happened, you can however decided how to live in the present.|`|ksCIicizaa	In a word "no."    I don't know where you two are or have been, on this so this is only speculative    I cannot begin to express my concern for you here.  All I am willing to say in this forum is that you "good man" may not be living up to your (or his) billing.  Or perhaps, you have entered into a marriage with the thought that you could somehow 'change' him.  ONLY If you are being totally honest here, then you may be subject to what is termed as 'emotional abuse."    It is extremely difficult to wrap our brains around the fact that the the person you to whom you have given your most implicit trust would treat it so lightly, but that is what you seem to be describing.  If the situation you present is accurate and free of personal neediness then you must draw up the courage to look at your relationship in a more realistic light.  On the other hand, if you entered this marriage knowing him and his disposition on such matters,  then it would be unfair for you to try to 'change the rules" of your union.     I would STRONGLY suggest that you you seek marriage counseling  {even if your spouse declines, you will benefit from an outside viewpoint.)  Blessings....

8xmqpYWJaa	Creo que hay muchas opciones, cada cabeza es un mundo...... algunas veces se da:    - Porque la mujer es muy joven y no puede hacerse cargo del beb  - Algunas veces porque el beb tiene deformaciones que le impediran llevar una vida normal  - A veces es espontaneo, el beb muere dentro de la madre y se debe sacar.  - A veces la mam sufre de enfermedades mentales que la incapacitan para tener hijos.  - A veces simplemente la gente no quiere compromisos.

Ese tipo de investigacin psicolgica se llama Grafologa, es y ser capaz de aportar conocimientos psicolgicos del hombre, y no tan slo de apropiarse de los conocimientos psicolgicos ajenos, sino tambin para cumplir sus cometidos utilizando el lenguaje actual.      Muchos se resisten a ver la relacin que existe entre el movimiento grfico y la personalidad son de tipo perjudicial y emotivo. La resistencia se produce a causa de los factores sociales, religiosos  que no permiten creer que el propio "Yo" puede ser tan fcilmente examinado.    La Grafologa no solo es una ciencia autnoma de la Psicologa, sino propiamente como la Psicologa de la Expresin, o ms concretamente como Psicologa de la Escritura, tal como la han denominado diversos creadores e investigadores de la ciencia grafolgica.

Las dificultades ocurren cuando conviven en un mismo territorio varias culturas .Un ejemplo es la disputa que existe actualmente en Francia si se debe permitir a las ni?as de religin Musulmana usar o no el chador en las escuelas publicas.

Los Paises Desarrolados al lograr  el equilibrio moral de su sociedad y de dominar los Derechos Fundamentales dell Ciudadano, se han irroigado el cliche de ser los abanderados de llevar esa perfeccion donde disque se ha distorsionado el concepto de Derechos Fundamentales y con su intervencion se busca corregir ello e imponer ese tipo de organizacion societaria.  Si ponemos en balanza o nivel de Etica tendriamos que situarnos en una posicion para dar un  veredicto de acuerdo a nuestra postura frente al pais o nacion subyugada, lo cual restaria la objetividad de nuestra evaluacion.

En quoi un couple homo serait-il moins stable, moins aimant, moins confortable qu'un couple htro?    - L'argument contre est souvent qu'un enfant a besoin de se crer une image du pre ET de la mre. Donc dans ce cas faut-il retirer leurs enfants aux femmes dont les compagnons sont partis durant leur grossesse, ou avec qui ils ont divorc?    - Enfin ce problme d'enfant ne touche que les couples homosexuels masculins. En effet les couples htro peuvent avoir des enfants naturellement, ou les adopter.. Les couples homosexuels fminins peuvent avoir des enfants naturellement. Donc ce refus d'accorder le droit  une famille n'est effectif que pour une seule catgorie de couples.    - Enfin que doit-on faire des enfants ns naturellement, dans un couple pseudo-htro?

i9PfjsoHaa	Yo a veces me pregunto lo mismo. Pero he notado lo siguiente: Hay una diferencia entre razonar y "estar sobreconciente".   Me parece que razonar, de manera objetiva y manteniendo la calma - "keeping it cool"- es una cosa. El lmite, dira yo, es que no interfiera con lo que tienes que hacer en tu vida diaria, por ejemplo... Si vas caminando en la calle, presta at'n, no te vayan a atropellar o t atropellar a alguien por ir "levitando". Si tienes que presentar un examen hay que concentrarse en ese momento y dejar la "extensa meditacin" para otro momento.  Otra cosa es, como te digo, "estar sobre conciente" ser un perfeccionista, nunca estar satisfecho, darle mil vueltas a los propios o ajenos errores, etc. En ese caso (darle vueltas a lo negativo) es ya una locura si esto te atormenta. Slo debera servirnos para aprender y tomar mejores decisiones la prxima vez.   En fin, tengo mucha curiosidad por leer las dems respuestas a tu pregunta. Espero entre todos aportemos algo interesante! Bye!|`|638b13f44c2c3e04e6e419f3b6594ad8aa	el limite yo diria q seria cuando haces una locura y saber q la estas regando y te estas volviendo loco|`|O4tTDHLOaa	El razonamiento siempre va dirigido a un fin, a alcanzar algn objetivo. La mente funciona siempre en base a al menos dos mecanismos esenciales:  1) Una jerarqua de valores. Para cada persona, hay cosas que son fundamentales, que no pueden estar ausentes en su vida normal, porque todos sus esfuerzos, sus acciones y, en el caso de tu pregunta, sus razonamientos, estn determinados por lo que para l son la razn de ser de su vida, los valores y objetivos supremos.  2) Un objeto de anlisis por vez. Si alguien est enfocando su atencin en los colores de un objeto, en cmo van cambiando segn los lugares de luz y sombra, etc., no podr estr simultneamente calculando la velocidad de ese objeto, la direccin, la aceleracin, etc. Puede determinar todas esas variables, pero siempre de a una por vez, y siempre asociando su actividad con algn propsito u objetivo que hace que esa actividad tenga sentido y sea priorizada por su voluntad.  Cuando el razonamiento est dentro de esos contextos, siempre tendr un objeto de anlisis y siempre la actividad de razonar estar vinculada a los objetivos que se persiguen.  Un cientfico puede estar das o meses obsesionado con  una nueva teora sobre algn aspecto de la materia, pero no por eso perder el equilibrio ni mucho menos, aunque pueda mostrarse distrado o desvinculado de algunos aspectos de la vida prtctica.  El razonamiento obsesivo, al que pienso que t te refieres, puede llevar a la locura no por el razonamiento en s, que es una actividad normal de la mente, sino por el objeto del razonamiento. La patologa est antes del razonamiento, en aquello acerca de lo cual razonamos. Puede ser que tenga ciertos miedos patolgicos, como podra ser a los virus, y comienzo a razonar en que no puedo escaparme de ninguna manera de esos virus. Mi razonamiento me llevar a un pozo sin salida, posiblemente a una obsesin enfermiza, y no a la solucin de un problema, como cuando aplico esa misma actividad y esfuerzo a otros planteos. Saludos.|`|esatbnfQaa	todos estamos locos|`|rqde5PwBaa	depende del sistema de creencias de cada persona, por ejemplo para algunas personas oir ladar un perro es mas que suficiente para enloquecer y perder la razon, como le pasa a mi vecino.

848f75b2d80efbaf2e5e5b809911996faa	You may have ADD. There are many bright people who have a difficult time sticking to something due to their ADD. Ask you doctor to look into it. It's a fairl;y simple thing to fix and your accomplishments will be worth the little effort it takes to get it diagnosed or ruled out.  If you also tend to have a temper, then it's really possible you have this. It's no big deal, but the sooner you address it the sonner you can get on with a more fulfilling life.|`|56a2c12d6cc205a92eb64ece9ccda3b4aa	Respectfully, Simon, I suggest that you simply don't apply yourself.  And yes, that is laziness.  At only 13, you should take the steps to remedy the situation and force yourself to finish your projects and study...as it will cause more problems for you in the future.  And while you are at it, might I suggest you spend some time working on your spelling and grammar...as I find it difficult to believe that someone at your age cannot spell the word 'maybe' and still manage to obtain an 85% in your studies!|`|9ZC5OkoKaa	i always get board of somethink that i start ding i never get rond to finishing any think. i have to be mean to my self cause if i dont do it no 1 elce will.|`|7x4cOFcuaa	blah blah blah|`|AA11526358	could be a fear of failure.      i know you said that you don't need to study to still get a high score; but, what if you did study, and didn't get 100% ?  are you affraid that you might find out that your full potential is not actually perfect?    alternately; you may just be bored with the lack of challenge these projects provide because of your high intelligence.    try talking it through with a school counsellor.    all the best.|`|N3phzjtsaa	You have many years in your life to perfect the art of finishing something you start. Remember, in the world out there you are measured by the results you produce, and the success you achieve in your working / personal life. Having great ideas, being able to see the whole picture regarding a given problem, are great talents that you obviously possess. However, always knowing what to do and never quite doing it amounts to a life of non-achievement - failure in other words.    Set yourself goals. Not a wish list, but real goals - things you wish to do and need / want to complete. A goal is something you set for yourself within a given time (a day, hours, weeks, months etc.) Also, you must, as you abviously do, have an exact plan as to how you will finish the goal / project by that time. That is what a goal is, quite simply. Set up a timetable, or diary, and as you finish a project / achieve a goal, mark it down. If you map out your progress, it will begin to be more of a fun thing to see how many projects or goals you have a tick for, or a cross against. When you finish something, reward yourself (anything you can think of.) Anything you don't finish, then obviously, don't reward itself. Think of the reward as being like getting paid by somebody (a boss, family member) for a job well done, or heartily congratulated,but do this in your mind, a type of role play.     See what happens after a while, the joy of finishing someting you start, looking back and saying to yourself - Hey, I did that!!|`|ij68PXEcaa	Listen, I am 15 and i had the same problem when i was your age.    You said that 15 minutes are enough for you to understand what you've read. That means that you are intelligent and smart. Also you have great memory (probably).    The psychological fact is that Its easier to absorb information in quick "bursts" than in extended sessions(yes, this advice is contrary to your goal of  absorbing material during long sessions, BUT IT WORKS).    This means that if you study for a long period of time you will get bored and if you continue you will get more bored until at last you will mentally exhaust yourself.    I had the same problem and i thought that I am beginning to get lazy, but that was not the case. Today I am in high school and sill, I am studying only 20-30min.    So my advice is - continue this way - use your talent and intelligence wisely - and you wont have trouble with laziness.

I've been riding my own Harley Davidson LEGALLY since I was 17 years old, now Iam 60 and still riding.  I can shoot, hunt, track and hold my own. When I separated from my husband (Former) he told me that Couldn't go down to South America alone. Wrong! I went, rented a car and toured allover Honduras and El Salvidor. Yes, it was only 6 months after they found the dead nuns.  I went and had a great time and meet many locals and enjoy their company, including staying in their huts and sleeping in hammocks.  Iam tall, blond, blue eyed and took nothing but love, and never made opinions on their life style I only saw beauty. NO ONE TELLS ME I CAN'T. I'll do everything I can to do it.

rcCYssKYaa	Yes.  My 2 best friends are both in love with being in love.<br>  One has to have a replacement (or 2) before dumping her boyfriend.<br>  The other needed a LOT of emotional support from her friends (me) and a possible replacement, before she got enough gumption to dump her boyfriend.  Then she clung to that "possibility" so hard he ran, found another to cling to, same deal.  The third she ended up marrying.

8d8ejHPfaa	I have to agree with the others about the relationship, that you're worried the relationship will end, and you are worried that he will be the one to "end it all"  That you lay with him on the way to the morgue suggests that you aren't ready to let this relationship go, but you yet acknowledge that the relationship is heading there.  Death in dreams generally marks times of transition, an end to a part of your life.  Suicide specifically is a deliberate ending where one takes things into one's own hands.  I don't think it's prophetic of an actual suicide on his part, unless he has said something awful to you like "If you leave me I'll kill myself" (sometimes people will do things like that to manipulate a lover) , if he hasn't said any thing like that, then I don't think it's something you need to take literally in this imagery.  I know it's not an easy thing to deal with, you call this man your fiance, if the two of you can't manage right now, well, at least that's better than finding out after you're married.  Good luck, I hope things work out for the best for you, and that this end leads you to a much better beginning....|`|ngt2B4QOaa	Death in a dream is not always a bad thing it can mean the change in someone life like finishing school and starting work or changing career's. I would suggest that the relationship is over and that you will be very upset for a while after it all ends.|`|AA12360662	Your fiance's life is not based on your dream or what you visualize at night.<br>  <br>  Projecting him killing himself may reflect some insecurity in you.  You are feeling lack of confidence in him.  So, in projection, he is killing himself is a symbolic way to tell you that you are feeling lack of confidence in him.<br>  <br>  I am not sure how he is in reality, but that is how you view him subconsciously.   The tough time you are going through may also give you some signal about this dream.  <br>  <br>  On one hand, you don't have confidence in him, on the other hand, it may be some release of anger, or stress you have about the relationship and that is why you had to vent this out.|`|oxsawg31aa	Maybe its relating to your relationship ending? Maybe in your heart you know things arent going to work out and it was signifying the "death" of your relationship, and you letting go of him. Or maybe it didnt mean anything and you had eaten something to cause you nightmares|`|RyYV3aXlaa	Sounds like deep down in side you know that its over with you and him, and your worried what he will do when that happens.|`|Q0ExafZzaa	Ask him if he is suicidal. From what i read, suicidal people are ready to talk about it and then ask for help immediately. Good luck.|`|9XsBVRH0aa	i think the devil is gettin into the head of your husband to kill himself and God has reveal that to you to destroy the plan of the devil if you want i could give you a church that God uses and is really good at that stuff and could pray for your husband get back if you want it.
VkzmH1GKaa	Yes we are all different, free will is inate in us all. Use your own moral compass to decide your actions.|`|AA11705909	Yes, we are all different, just like everyone else. Can you give an example of what you are saying?|`|trMsK86jaa	No, but it does mean that if you think it's important enough you should strongly consider stopping what you're doing.<br>  <br>  Doesn't mean you have to, but that would be the logical conclusion.<br>  <br>  Of course, people tend to be Anything but Logical.|`|xOX7yMczaa	i dont understand. be more specific pleaseeee

I grew up in a small town so everyone knew everyone.  I can't get it out of my head now that I might see these people again, even though I know I won't.  Lol.|`|YNz1D4wDaa	No way. Unless you feel you have hurt their feelings, other than that you are who you are and they do not know you any how.
2UnjeOQUaa	Hey Jen, It's hard to give this advice because I don't really know you or your boyfriend. You have invested 2 years. It might be time to cut your losses and move on. Relationships are hard enough as it is. Communication is crucial and without it all the little things become big things which should be little things. My wife has taken a couple of good right crosses to my jaw. She is a little woman and it is funnier than it is painful. I try not to laugh because that would just piss her off more. In any case, once our anger settles down, we talk, we apologize and we try and learn from it and move on.|`|ngt2B4QOaa	I don't think the slap in the arm is the real problem I think it maybe more about what else was said and what the fight was over, give him a couple more days and approach him again.|`|trMsK86jaa	It depends how long that forgiving person had been forgiving for.|`|CQySHj5oaa	First off, if it was just a slap in the arm--then this isn't the problem. <br>  <br>  I think your BF is enjoying having the upper hand right now. He is enjoying you calling to apologize and pour emotions and he is loving that he can disregard you, knowing you won't stop showering him with attention. He is on top, knows it and loves it. Guys like to have these little power trips from time to time. (Girls do too) This is a very familiar game that people (usually people with a more passionate personality type) tend to play in their relationships from time to time. It keeps things interesting. He knows that the make-up is inevitable and will be better, the longer he holds out and acts mad/holds the power.<br>  <br>  What should you do? Well, you can keep feeding his ego with the phone calls or texts. Or you can try to reclaim a little footing and just stop calling. Make one last call/text and just say, "Well, I am very sorry, but I will give you some space. Call me when you're ready"..and leave it there.|`|hYZIYla0aa	Wish I had the perfect answer,but no one will.Maybe tell him,that you will leave him alone,you are sorry,and tell him when he is able to talk.A slap in the arm seems very little to me,but wrong is wrong too.|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	Its his choice.  You can't make someone like you.|`|jlXIAAdaaa	Well the first wong move you made was using violence. Simpley because if your boyfriend is truly forgiving person chances are he's also a gentle person. SHOW HIM you want to resolve your problems in a more civil way, with plenty of love, respect, AND PATIENCE. Start and continue these practices, and I garentee positive out looks within a week. BUT REMEMBER DO NOT FORCE THE ISSUE. Give him time to notice your reform.

f818472f16219eceb6f373875538a20aaa	Que te esta pasando BabyluLu??? por la forma en que redactas me doy cuenta que eres una chica muy inteligente y sensible.    Mira amiga...si, es cierto, hay momentos en la adolescencia y en la vida adulta en los que uno siente que "ya no puede mas" te sientes frustrada y pasan muchas cosas por tu cabeza...pero son precisamente esos momentos los que te dan fuerza para lidiar con todo lo que se te viene encima, es cierto! caemos, pero lo mas importante de todo es levantarnos.    No explicas quienes son esas personas que te "hacen  la vida de cuadritos", no se si son tus familiares, si son tus amigos, o si es gente que esta a tu alrededor y que influye en tu vida...no se quienes sean, pero noto que estan ejerciendo mucha presion sobre ti...tranquilizate! si realmente crees que las cosas se estan saliendo de control, s, busca ayuda psicologica, definitivamente, todos necesitamos, que alguien nos escuche y nos de opciones para seguir adelante.    Eso de provocarte el vomito, no es mas que debido a la tension y rechazo que sientes por lo que estas viviendo...no lo hagas, trata de descargar esa tension en algun deporte, dibujando, pintando o haciendo algo productivo para ti...al vomitar no desapareces la realidad, no haces que esas personas cambien, no te hace sentirte mejor sino como tu misma dices "te asfixia mas" y le haces da?o a tu organismo.

Todas esas cosas las podrs ir superando con el tiempo, pero no habrs disfrutado de tu adolescencia y probablemente tampoco disfrutes al mximo tus primeros a?os en la edad adulta.     Lo que yo como profesional de la salud mental te recomiendo, es que acudas con un psiquiatra para que te haga una valoracin de tu estado anmico y pueda identificar alguna depresioncilla por ah. Si no descubre ningn tipo de distimia o depresin, te canalizar con un psiclogo que te dar sin duda una orientacin adecuada.     Todo lo anterior te lo digo por lo que mencionas del vmito y de que esa situacin esta interfiriendo en actividades tan comunes como la escuela. Como te repito, la adolescencia es dolor pero hasta cierto punto y me parece que en ti hay algo ms que una simple situacin de adolescente.     Cuidate y lee libros de autoayuda, te servirn mucho.
