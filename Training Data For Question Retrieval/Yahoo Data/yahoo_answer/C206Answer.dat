v0596BTeaa	Usually within 4 to 5 days of the baby being born.  At first the breasts secrete a rich liquid called colostrum which contains all the nutrients to give your baby a good start, but then the hormones required for milk production kick in and women begin to make milk for their baby according to supply and demand, so the more you feed, the more milk you make.  Some women do have 'leaky' breasts for a month or two before giving birth.|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	Milk came right after you are deliver your angel.........)|`|cdd2bde8cb22b86cb1774e7ed63bed26aa	if ur asking when is the best to time to give ur baby regular milk and not formula i would recommen when the babys a year old.|`|niGAKJT4aa	after delivery, but sometimes it takes a day or two.|`|cPlDc7I1aa	I fed both of my sons within an hour of them being born.|`|suxunLtLaa	just after delivery|`|eabe182e629146523f7d07ea0512f03caa	it can take up to about a week after you have your baby to have your breast milk fully to be in. You can feed you baby within a hour or 2 from birth. If you're not sure your baby's getting enough you can give them a little formula.|`|nSva5cblaa	moonlight is right. also oatmeal,and chicken broth help after birth to  produce milk faster  , i stayed in hosp for 2 da and my mom made oatmeal n chicken broth the Next day the colostrum was gone and it was Just milk|`|C3cH7RALaa	it starts as u turn prig, so u can feed baby after birth immediately.|`|7a35e1d6e3906d179e99e16ca6707209aa	soon as the baby is born, the milk is ready.|`|j3XhuCC3aa	just after the birth of child.|`|gtGDr73Taa	at the time of pregancy

ytE1q20taa	Don't worry about it, they just want to get to know you and are doing so by asking questions.<br>  At least they are talking to you.<br>  A lot of parents won't talk to the girlfriend/boyfriend because they don't approve, at least you know they approve of you :)|`|hqafbKQRaa	darling your reading way too much into it... they are making small talk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
79eRDIbXaa	Hey Honey<br>  I started feeling Movement at 16/17week, some days more then others and on the od days nothing at all. I know its a worry but seriously you don't need to, Im sure the baby is just fine - Just sleeping or you simply cant feel it moving depending on where it is at the moment.<br>  Congrats and Good Luck Xxxx|`|EFc8VGwRaa	its quite normal for then to have a rest day...meaning you feel your baby then the next nothing..sometimes baby is still to little to feel all the time and is very hard to tell if that was movement or not as baby could be in a different position...but if you are worried go and see your doctor or give them a call they will be happy to answer any of your questions...or try drinking some juice or very cold water then laying on your left side..baby should move then if within an hour and still nothing give your doctor a call.|`|nNrCV4pmaa	some babies rarly move and others move allot but we are not doctors so the best is to consult your doctor|`|ZIkSvP6taa	I would see a doctor - better to be safe.<br>  <br>  God luck :-)|`|C3cH7RALaa	its normal if u have doubt just go 4 ultrasound

OBzIzElFaa	You need to tell your parents A.S.A.P. You won't be able to hide your pregnancy for very long. No one can make you have an abortion. That is your choice. If your sister knows, then so should your parents. I wish you the best of luck-congrats!|`|PLeFgKEHaa	umm... you are 14 definately abort it. i have had so many friends ruin their lives because they got pregnant. you have college to look forward to, you have your whole life ahead of you. and lets be honest... you are 14; not only is that going to ruin your life, that is going to potentially be harmful to your body. also, i feel bad for the kid that grows up being made fun of cuz his mommy is only 14 years older than he is. you are essentially going to ruin your life and your child's life by making the immature decision to have a child at your age.|`|skSzDIlwaa	well how along are you? also if you tell them you better watch it cause they might always make you trip or hit you in the stomach where that can hurt the baby inside you. but a good time is really any time that you feel is okay|`|oR3v2IUmaa	You need to tell your parents!!  You need to be receiving the proper medical care during your pregnancy.  You shouldn't be excited about being pregnant at the age of 14!|`|rBq189W1aa	After the baby's born.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, they can't *make* you have an abortion. That's your choice to make, one way or the other, nobody else's.|`|OV2HxkYraa	5 years old sister keep a secret? umm yeah sure you will hear "mama im going to be auntie yay" they will know in no time. good luck stupid to tell your 5 years old sister thinking that she would keep a secret hahaha.|`|1VdgsZPoaa	They can't make you have an abortion, the best time to tell them would be when they aren't busy or preoccupied.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	idiot - what did your parents do to deserve this? i think youre lying - just simply because you know how to spell pregnant.|`|2B6rMPN9aa	1.you arent old enought to drive<br>  2.you arent old enought to work<br>  <br>  how do you plan on supporting a kid? i think you are making a selfish decision with you parents finaces 6y having a kid you have no means to support. allowance cant pay for diapers. 14 years olds shouldnt 6e having sex that is just trashy. what happened to waiting? i quess its just easyier to give it all away when your young so you have nothing specail when your older. <br>  <br>  you keep this kid your life is over. you may love it. 6ut life is over.|`|TYGeVBlMaa	you should tell your parents at the earliest...even if they would get angry they r ur parents they love u and r concerned.. at 15 you shud finish school...go for higher studies not change diapers..if you ignore this u will be with a kid all your life..the cuteness of the baby fades when you find responsibility mounting and ur not giving your best to the baby if you want your parents to help u ,u should tell|`|xhu4RWDaaa	My dear they will find out in no time....you told a 5 year old for heavens sake.  I'm sure she will break the news in the fastest most mature way .|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Yeah, right. Because 5 year olds are just so stunningly reliable at keeping secrets (rolls eyes).|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	You're 14. What the hell are you doing? You're ruining your life.|`|sxecXFgraa	You should tell them now.  There is no "safe" time to tell them in regards to the possibility of them wanting you to have an abortion, but they cannot force you to have one at anytime.  Since you are only 14 and they don't know you're sexual active, this is going to be a shock to them.  If you tell them now or when you start to show, they are going to think about the negative things, you're young, no job, can't financially take care of a baby, etc.  Telling them now will give you and them more time to plan for the baby and give them a chance to get use to the idea of being a grandparent.<br>  <br>  Oh, as the other posters have said, 5 year olds do not really understand what a secret is.  She may not of said anything yet but she will let it slip.  She may of already said something but your parents blew it off because they think she doesn't know anything about how babies actually come about or just assumed you and her were talking about when you grow up, you'll get married, have kids, and she'll be an aunt.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	Wow!!! What are you missing in your life that you think a baby is going to provide you at 14?  Where is your biological mother?  It floors me that you're 14 and think you're mature enough for the responsibility of a child?!! I am 33 and I still struggle with not beign selfish some times!!  There is no right time to tell them and really picking a random boy and letting him knock you up without telling him is a true sign of complete selfishness and immaturity and it shows that you are in no way shape or form ready to be a parent!!  God help that innocent child you are carrying!!|`|f3SyOyMEaa	Oh Jeez girl. Your parents need to know. You have to be able to get back and forth to the doctor. I think it's after the first trimester that you can't have an abortion, but I'm not sure...<br>  You need to just let them know. They are going to figure it out on their own. The daddy of the baby needs to know what's going on, and of course his parents have a right to know as well.<br>  I wish you the best because this is SO MUCH to take on.<br>  Best Wishes and keep us informed please!|`|RsFxgN4Gaa	Since you need prenatal care NOW is the time to tell them. You can't put off getting the medical care you need because you are afraid to tell your parents.<br>  <br>  If you can't tell them this then you obviously aren't ready for a child.
grId923jaa	I wouldnt worry too much everyone looks different.Im only 15wks 4days & I look like Im about 20wks!! I haven't put on any weight either, just some people pop out quicker than others. :oD|`|79eRDIbXaa	Yes sounds normal to me - all women start putting on the weight in different ways.<br>  Congrats and Good Luck Xxx|`|Sw96YBvTaa	Everybody is different, while some people takes months to show others can show really early.|`|a37f465fb3af30fb69356b87ea42c178aa	I'm 9.5 weeks and have a bump too. I also haven't put on any weight as yet, so it's not because I'm over eating which some people may accuse!! Every woman (and pregnancy) is different and some start showing much earlier then some!

wENdWT5kaa	Well, i don't believe women are spreading falsehoods about delivery. Every woman is different and we all have different tolerances to pain.<br>  <br>  I don't know, but trying to squeeze a little person out of your vagina, sure does sound painful to me. But i would not know, had both my kids by c-section, which, by the way, hurt more than biting my tongue and scalding water. <br>  <br>  I would not describe my experience as very painful, but it wasn't all painless either. But like i said, we all have different tolerances to pain and no one should be criticized for that.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Not everyone is you. Giving birth (actually, failing to give birth) was the most painful experience of my life - and no, I'm not a "woosie", I'm someone who once drove home with a broken wrist (manual gearshift), and someone who stopped taking painkillers 3 days after a C-section when many people are still on IV morphine!<br>  <br>  So it didn't hurt for you. Congratulations, you got lucky. Now why don't YOU stop spreading falsehoods about that being true for everyone?|`|70Z4DJOcaa	you are obviously full of s**t!!  your baby must have been half a pound!! lets see if you can do what i did... 46 hours of labour, no drugs, 10 pound baby - and i'm a very small woman!! I'll wanna see you go through that without making a noise of discomfort!!|`|498JdszFaa	Lucky you.<br>  <br>  My experiences are very different.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	ok so how many babies have u had? <br>  if u have had babies then lucky u for being pain free|`|CPwdVc4caa	Why is it so hard to grasp the concept that every woman, and every baby, are built differently and may have a different experience from what  you did?  Just because it was easy for you doesn't make another woman's experience invalid because she had a harder time.  Everything from a different skeletal structure, to complications, to size of the baby, to simple level of pain tolerance makes a huge difference in the way a woman experiences labor and delivery.  Before medical advances, women and children routinely DIED during childbirth...and you honestly think that it isn't a legitimately traumatic experience for some women?  Get off your high horse and stop being so egocentric.|`|PYafv6gSaa	i think its the fact that you never really know when its going to stop and its constant were as a burn wears off i fund it painful but other things ie experienced like burns and biting my toungue really hurt but the real pain for me was the after pains abd some people have actualy had bad labours and will never do it again maybe that was there biggest pain so far my cousin had a 72 hour labour thats why some women think its bad but i was only 3 hours|`|J1stiMioaa	aaah and i bet your kids slept through the night at 6 weeks, walked at 10 months, mensa certificates at 1 year, i feel there is a touch of competative mum here.<br>  i had a epidural with my first, morphine with my second (who was stillborn so dont even say that isnt painful physically and emotionally unless u have done it yourself) and my 3rd was natural (8lb 7oz) but i dont have a high horse and respect any woman who gives birth needing drugs/naturally or even c section, we are all different|`|PLbmKNpvaa	For a start, it's WUSSY, not Woosie. <br>  <br>  For seconds... Get over yourself! You're lucky, not better.<br>  <br>  For thirds (and I know that you've probably already heard this but it's true) they don't give out medals for doing it without painkillers. <br>  <br>  And lastly... I dislocated my elbow and was told the pain is equivalent to twice the pain of childbirth. When you went into having your first baby you had no idea what to expect. Well I do... And I'm still doing it anyway. Sure, you've had two more since then. But I haven't had the benefit of hormones that make you forget how painful a dislocated elbow is... So I reckon that makes me more of a woman than you :P|`|79eRDIbXaa	Your experience of giving Birth could be totally different to other women's so how can you say its not that painful.<br>  <br>  Two women could break their leg but you cant say its not that painful for her as its not that painful for you. As the breaks may be different and people handle pain differently.<br>  <br>  Woosies?.........How Rude!|`|Sw96YBvTaa	I think your forgetting that the body releases a chemical that makes you forget how bad child birth is. Unless you have a completely natural birth without any pain relief whatsoever then you cant say nothing hurts more.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	What a load of crap is all I have to say to that. Did your babies fly out with golden wings or something?<br>  <br>  ETA: I did backpain labour with no epidural with my first and it killed.

Q1t0XzgZaa	Ask your parents where you were adopted from, and visit that center. See what they can help you with, if anything. The poster above me is correct, it is much harder in the US to find birth parents. But you can start searches online, look at diff adoption centers. You need to firstly find out where you were born. Im not sure on adoption birth certificates, if it lists the actual place, town, hospital.....but you can try there if it does. If you werent born where you live now, I wouldnt worry about it. Odds are you arent going to end up dating your brother although it COULD happen, but doubtful. Also keep in mind, if you can find out your birthparents names, could you leave it at that? Just knowing names? Subconsciously you might want to do more than that. Just a thought....good luck to you!|`|27fcbd4a2b0b4c5a2c64b68f6be0547faa	It depends where you were born - and where your adoption took place.<br>  <br>  Here in Australia - adoption records are open (whether it was a closed or open adoption) - once you turn 18.<br>  <br>  Sadly in the USA most states seal adoption records for life!!!<br>  Yeah - adoptees have less human rights than most.

Even in so-called 'open' adoptions the records are sealed by the State  upon finalization of the adoption and the adoptee will never be able to apply for the record of birth in the same way non adopted people are able to.<br>  <br>  Most civilized nations do not withold this information from a human being.<br>  <br>  However in the United States only Six States have restored the right of adoptees to access their own factual record of birth.  Two of those States were never sealed at all.<br>  <br>  In other States, petition the Family Court where the adoption was finalized and show 'good cause' - which is open to the interpretation of the Judge.   Being native American is automatically 'good cause' and they can reconnect with their tribe, yet someone needing bone marrow from a relative have been turned away as not showing 'good cause' :(<br>  <br>  Join the movement for the restoration of Adoptee Rights so we have equal access to our vital records, just the same as non-adopted adults. adopteerights.net<br>  <br>  If you amend your Q to say where the birth and adoption took place, you will get more accurate answers|`|8YJkmzqGaa	i was also adopted and that was all i wanted to know as well. when i called to open the records they asked if i have a medical reason for it i told them no i just wanted my records and i was now over the age of 18<br>  they said it was closed for a reason and the only way they can reopen it is to have a medical reason from a doctor that was life or death situation.  this was done in New York.

It is really early to get this nervous . If you keep it up you will be insane by the time you deliver. If you are more than 4 weeks pregnant and miscarriage trust me you will know it, the pain is just like labor and you bleed allot. You are fine. I am guessing this is your first lol. Take a deep breath buy a pregnancy book,and concentrate all that energy you are using to worry about this pregnancy on getting ready for your little one once he or she gets here. I have three sons ,trust me dear this is the easy part.Good Luck ! and Congrats!!!|`|UqDIhxcdaa	I was exactly the same, but knowing early won't help. Your little bub is probably fine just growing in there but even if something is wrong they can't do anything. Just be excited to see your bub soon :)
MkKvGdxKaa	It is normal, the baby has less room to move around now, which is why you can feel pushing etc but not kicks and large kerks. If this is something you have noticed all of a sudden though and it hasnt been gradual i'd go and get the heartrate checked anyway just to be sure. Good luck with the rest of the pregnancy!! x<br>  <br>  Edit: Oh, and NEVER worry about being neurotic, you have the right to get things checked out if you want, and the clinic would rather you did that than didnt tell them about something you were concerned about. so if that's all that's stopping you then go and see them. They wont think you are being neurotic at all.<br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|4HcDAR49aa	The same thing happened to me. When i phoned the midwife, they advised me to sit  calm and drink freezing cold icey water, to make the baby move. I also went in to maternity to double check as i was so paranoid. They listened to the heart beat and everything was ok- and app this is normal. However, its always best to put your mind at rest|`|EfhBkUaPaa	I am also 34 weeks and latley I believe my baby has become alot more active than before... His moves are not so smooth any more but more of jerking like movements. He has been very active since 20 weeks +... I would call my doctor to be sure... And don't think you are being neurotic either. Its better to be safe than sorry! I at times to was concerned and  there is nothing like hearing his little heartbeat loud and strong found to be the most comforting sound ever! Give yourself some peace of mind and go see your Doc. so you can reassure yourself that everything is okay! <br>  Good luck and Congrats!|`|7fcL7pVUaa	Same thing happened to me.  Plus i was feeling many braxton hix and actual (mild) labor pains.  But I was fine.  I called with my concern.  The doc said if no movement and pains progressed and became closer together then i would need to be seen and monitored.  She didn't completely stop moving but slowed down a lot.  Definantly running out of room.  I'm ready to pop!|`|d68s6Ug2aa	i wouldnt really worry about it as at this stage in pregnancy movement becomes less as there is less room 4 baby to move around it doesnt mean anything is wrong i had the same with my baby but there was nothing wrong with baby if ur really worried go to ur doctor just put urself at ease i hope i helped good luck x|`|ybexjS2Paa	It is normal, the baby has less and less room for easy movements. You should feel at least 10 baby movements during the day, if you do then it's fine. If you are concerned about it go to maternity and check out.|`|C3cH7RALaa	it is normal <br>  sometimes its happens <br>  but do ultrasound|`|OJFz0LBZaa	my little one is moving less now and has been in the last few weeks, i talked to my consultant who gave me a kick chart and as long as you have 10 movement between 9am and 9pm there is nothing to worry about, if after 48 hours your getting less movements than 10 in the 12 hour period stated phone your midwife, but babies do tend to slow down in the last few weeks|`|Lck9Fg04aa	iv read its normal but im telling you in 4 weeks il probably post the same question lol i worry about everything...<br>  im sure as long as your baby is still moving everything is ok, if you think there has been a dramastic drop in the movement then go to your doctor- trust your instincts- better safe than sorry right??|`|Z7dKEJcgaa	No, this is normal.  I am 33 weeks tomorrow and have noticed the same thing.  Baby is running out of room to kick with force, so typically I will feel slight rolls and pushes instead.  As long as baby moves ten times in a day then you have nothing to worry about.  Also, you are not neurotic!  If for any reason you need reassurance you should ask your midwife.  If something is stressing you out, that is worse for baby.  If you are in the UK and are looking for some advice, you can also call the Cow and Gate midwife team (Number is on their website).  I spoke to someone there when I was worried about my fundal height being out and they were fantastic. x|`|CUYuAGF5aa	It is normal for the baby's movements to start slowing down around this time of your pregnancy becuase of the limited space it has now.  I said to my midwife that some days my little one has a really quiet day and other days its quite active and she said to ry and count the number of times in the day you feel it moving about.  On average you should feel it moving about 10 times a day.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|dIW2tVxhaa	Get it checked to put your mind at rest. Its a dangerous assumption that babies suddenly drop their movements in the last few weeks. I'm not saying anything IS wrong, but it's better to check out nothing than miss something :)|`|bx29mHrYaa	if your concerned you should be asking your midwife or gp their advice........asap!!!
OxFV92hJaa	Bottom line is tell him:<br>   "I'm suffering, and seeking help. If you have problems with that then you deal with them. I've told you what is going on, and you take it as a joke, I'm seeking help and would advise you to do the same"<br>  <br>  While you need his approval, you need yourself to be ok more. <br>  <br>  I went through a bad spell after our middle child was born. I kept that a secret for nearly a year! I conceived our second 6 weeks after a gruesome miscarriage, that we both just "moved on from". Problem was, that I conceived our second 6 weeks after, and I wasn't "moved on". So I went through that pregnancy in tears, upset, and questioning everything while trying to raise our 3 year old as an at home mom and him working 12 hr shifts with no days off and 0 family support. <br>  <br>  I didn't let my husband know anything was wrong, I just dealt with it the best I could. <br>  <br>  Don't put yourself through that hell!!!!! It is utter HELL. Seek help if it's needed, support or not. <br>  <br>  Going it alone is just that, ALONE! Find a Friend or family member you can talk to if you have one (I didn't). But seek help, because you deserve to be ok and enjoy those babies hun. <br>  <br>  If he's dealing with his own issues let him, you are #1 right now. <br>  <br>  Big hugs, hope you feel better soon. Because being there on ANY level is HELL !|`|dXVA1wHDaa	(Hugs)<br>  <br>  You need to talk to him again, or write everything down in a letter if you find it hard to get your point accross.  Maybe print out some info about PPD.  It's sometimes hard for men to understand how we can feel after having a baby, it can be a lonely time.  Is your husbnad normally more understanding than this?|`|2F5HNPqPaa	I had the same problem, cried everyday for weeks and felt like I couldn't cope anymore.  I told my fiancé I needed help and I couldn't cope... he gave me a hug the first time, but didn't actually help with anything and the next day sent me a text asking "Why are you so grumpy?"  I told him again and he didn't reply... a few days later he asked again and I told him I couldn't cope and he rolled his eyes and said "Yes, you keep saying," as though my telling him once would make it instantly all better.  <br>  <br>  I'm not sure whether it's men not understanding, they're too lazy to do anything to make things any more bearable or they think they're important and hard worked with their jobs (ha... try a day of motherhood!).  <br>  <br>  I'd say if he really is going to be this useless, go and stay with someone else for a few days.   Tell him you can't cope like this and you need help, you'll be with your friend/aunt/mum whatever... that may give him some time to think and hopefully a bit of a wake up call.  Also, I know you need more than a prescription, but maybe some formal diagnosis from a doctor will get through to your husband and he'll realise it's not just talk or hormones..  Other than that it's grit your teeth and bear it (what I'm doing but no other option).|`|FATyhyZ2aa	Some local hospitals have out reach groups that offer support.  Call the hospitals around you.  Ask if they have a social worker.  Ask social worker about support groups for PPD.  If not them, then maybe your free Mental Health clinic has a referral.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	I have come to realize men simply don't understand anything we go through in relation to pregnancy and childbirth, I guess you can't really blame them since they don't go through it, how could they truly understand?<br>  <br>  Honestly I would try to seek a therapist to talk to, not one who just writes a prescription for something, but someone to talk to and maybe your husband can join you sometimes.  <br>  <br>  He probably doesn't know what to say or do, which is why you need a third party to talk to, men aren't good at this stuff, I know that's probably not what you want to hear but it's reality...<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|y6g0RnuAaa	If your husband is anything like mine, he doesn't care to get into emotions. It is too much to bear to talk about feelings. My husband only likes to joke around and talk about lighter things. Having a serious talk is too much work and he'd rather pretend the issues don't exist.<br>  <br>  If that describes your husband then the only thing you can do is seek help alone. Your doctor can not only provide you with meds (if desired) but can also help you find some support since you have none at home. I am sure it seems so impossible and overwhelming at this time but you can do it. You had two babies- you can handle this.<br>  <br>  Once you start getting back to feeling like yourself, you should confront him. Tell him how he let you down and how unacceptable it is. You are not in a position now to do that now so just wait- you want to be sure anything you tell him is coming from you, not PPD.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you take that first step.|`|jXtbb11Haa	I really feel for you. <br>  <br>  Some people dont understand mental disorders at all. My boyfriend wouldnt talk about it when i had depression a while back. <br>  <br>  Its going to be really tough for both of you, but if you try hard enough then your relationship will pull through.<br>  <br>  Bear in mind that the way you feel is going to have a huge impact on the way your husband feels too. Get some medical help, and they may refer you to councelling for extra support. Also try to talk about other things with your husband as it will help you to take your mind off the way you are feeling and hopefully help him feel better too.

OV2HxkYraa	Personally I think when you feel when you are ready to tell her. Lie to her is not a good idea because she would found out whether from others plus she would lose your trust. Also you mentioned that your daughter is teenager, if your daughter is understandable person and is mature for her age maybe its right time for her to know how she was convinced. when you tell her this dont forget to add that it was unfortunate situation that result in fortunate to have her that would make her feel thankful that you dont decide to end her life in result of rape. Good luck. I know its not helpful but would give you some ideas how to tell her|`|qafpU90Yaa	If you think she is mature enough to understand the situation.<br>  <br>  Such a thing might still be alien to her, and it might be hard for her to understand. Think about her own maturity levels and compare it to her need of an answer, if you feel that maybe now isnt the right time, then trust your instincts.<br>  <br>  personally, if it were me, I would tell her.<br>  <br>  You sound like a great mother, and if you reassure her of all the things youve told us (your love and devotion to her) then it will cushion things a bit.|`|Ir3XPq4raa	I think only you can answer that question and shouldn't listen to anyone on here... I believe that you will know the right time and day and if your girl can handle it and is ready.... You have done a gr8 job raising her on your own so far, dont blow it now on what people say on here.... Good Luck....!!!!!|`|loRJX1Zwaa	she'll start to ask more questions and like you said you love and care for her so im sure u don't want to see her upset..<br>  my suggestion is to sit her down and explain everything to her. if u keep this secret from her it will only harm ur relationship in the long run.|`|hqafbKQRaa	you should tell her. if tell her that it doesnt matter how she was conceived that you still love her etc. but she wont stop asking|`|nHokdvx7aa	Yes, tell her. She deserves to know where she came from.|`|vTkbAOSLaa	Well that you don't want to keep it a secret forever just wait until the time is right when you are mentally and emotionally ready and she's a little more mature to understand give a little more time.|`|ysIAPgijaa	first off  i hope you went to the police. If not and you tell your daughter she would want to know if you went to the police. As for actually telling her, she deserves to know... She knows you love her and has the right to know... She cant and wont be mad a you. if it wasnt for you she wouldnt be here... She owes everything to you... Only good can come from letting out the pain...|`|OsqEbNAmaa	you should tell her.  If anything it will open her eyes to the seriousness of rape and help her understand that it can happen to anyone.  Make sure that she knows that she is a wonderful present that came out of a horrible situation.  That she isn't a mistake.  That it was fate that brought her to you.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I think treemead hit the nail on the head....tell your daughter, she deserves to know, but let her know you never regret having her and that she is so very special to you no matter how she came into this world./|`|X9JSlC6Iaa	Even though she is old enough to know what sex, rape is I doubt she would want to know. But if you feel she should know tell her. But don't tell her that you never wanted her. Tell her that you know you wanted her the day she was born. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|yNkxTJUjaa	Yes. She deserves to know. But make sure she knows that you love her. She was the beautiful thing that came out of the bad situation, and that it makes her all the more special to you.|`|BkdZq0QPaa	she deserves to know, no matter how horrible it was<br>  but i wouldnt yet, tell her when shes older <br>  shes only 15 so she'll probably handle it badly and act out|`|2ZXh00C5aa	Julius C, are you referring to Madame Bovary?|`|N9pKl35Xaa	If she was my daughter i would tell her, but only if i thought that she would be able to grasp and understand the whole situation. I know it would be hard on her to take it all in, but if i felt she would be able to handle the truth than of course i would tell her. To me, she deserves to know regardless of how much of a jerk her father is. I wouldnt tell her any younger than the age of 12 and no older than the age of 16. Than later on in life if she wants to discuss it she can ask me<br>  <br>  I think its better to be told at a teen age than let it out when they're 18 or 21. Its too late and i personally think its harder to take when you're older. I went to school with a few people who just grew up with their Mum's and their Mum's refused or lied about where their Fathers are and who they are. They were told when they turned 18 (which is not long ago for them) and they both said "I wished you would have told me this before i was 18" They were a little on edge with their Mums, little pissed off. Thats them though, they were people who would get pissed off over anything that concerned them in a bad light.. <br>  <br>  Dunno how old your daughter is though? But hey its upto you..
7fcL7pVUaa	With my first child, I was already at term but i woke up with cramping like menstral pains and went to pee and had the same thing.  Instead of my water breaking, i had a slow leak. which inturn caused me to have an infection and run fever during labor.  I called and the doc said come in.  But like I said I was a term and due in one day.  Even now pregnant with my third (36wks)  I check myself everytime i pee, and anything diff, i call just to be safe.  But like someone said it could be you are loosing your plug.  I never expierienced loosing my plug with either of my boys.  good luck to you!!!! and congrats!!!  It's a whole new world!|`|Lck9Fg04aa	it could be one of many things im 30 weeks and have experienced spotting 3 times throughout my pregnancy and all times the baby was fine.<br>  <br>  i never leave it though even if its just a spot of blood i see- i would call your doc just to check everything is ok like the previous person said it could be your mucus plug ...<br>  <br>  good luck|`|CUYuAGF5aa	The pink to brownish tinted discharge is most likely to be your show but isn't something to worry about unless it becomes red.  Even though you have this at this stage it just means that your labour could start anytime in the next couple of weeks.  The pains you are feeling is your body getting ready for labour starting.  If the pains get really painful then phone your midwife or hospital.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|ofz43OY4aa	a pink or brownish sort of marble affect discharge is called a show, and normally occurs just before labour! if your pains are like period pains and get progressively worse call your midwife cause your in labour! <br>  <br>  good luck xxxxx|`|wNtW1hXLaa	i was told that white was normal but if it was pink, red, brown to call the midwife at the hospital.|`|C3cH7RALaa	it is normal n be ready for delivery any time if u wish|`|Vebih4H7aa	it may be your plug preparing to come call ur midwife asap x
X9JSlC6Iaa	You leave her. BUT you stay and care for the baby when he/she comes. You don't have to be together to take care of the baby.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|c4d179c54efba1c73a993ab6f248346aaa	you can still take care of your child and not be around her..|`|IKXZZDH9aa	I made the mistake of staying with someone because they were pregnant with my child. Worst decision ever. If you are basing the entire reason, or even just the majority of it on the child then you need to leave. <br>  <br>  Regardless of how sure you think you are that this child is yours, the ONLY one that knows for certain is the mom. You NEED to have a dna test performed before you sign ANYTHING stating you are the father to this child. She cheated on you, so why in the world would put it past her to lying about who the father of her baby is?<br>  <br>  Protect yourself and the child and get a DNA test before you find out 5 years from now that the child is not yours and you're stuck with a court order to financially support this child.|`|N9pKl35Xaa	Take a break from her, go and clear your head even get out of the town if you have to. Than once you've settled down than have a chat with her. You don't HAVE to stay with her because its your child (i know that sounds really selfish) but you can still have an imput into your childs life, you have every right in the world to play a roll in that kids life regardless if you are with the childs Mother or not.<br>  <br>  Once a cheater - always a cheater. They may not cheat, but they'll think long and hard about it if the situation was to arise.|`|AA10529334	Perhaps you could consider forgiving her and going on.|`|nB3JH2Wjaa	Leave...|`|mzFUWq8iaa	break it off til she has the baby and gets a dna test to prove its yours. you dont have to be around the girl that is more than likely lying to you just because you think she is carrying your child.|`|nHokdvx7aa	Don't get involved with her but stay involved with your child. Don't stay in a relationship with her, but stay in one with your baby.|`|Ir3XPq4raa	How are you so sure that its yours???? Cheated once could have cheated before...???? Leave her for a while...

She was amazed (and obviously delighted!) and now he's a healthy happy 2 year old :)|`|7fcL7pVUaa	If it helps.  My husband and I did not plan any pregnancy.  Nor did we prevent it from possibly happening.  Our first not sure exactly when we conceived, we were having too much fun with each other to pin point when.  Ah, good times!  anyway.  Again without preventing it, we didn't conceive again for 3 1/2 years later, I new exact conception date.  At this point our lives had changed so much that our intimacy wasn't as often but still frequent.  Now, with my third, 6 years later.  And I definently know when we conceived.  It was an amazing wknd.  We didn't try or prevent!  God just felt it was time, I guess.  Don't get discouraged.  Stop trying!  Let it happen naturally!  The stress of trying can slow the process.  When it's right......it's right!|`|C3cH7RALaa	yes my wife got prig in one try 15th aug 1997.<br>  and we got a son.<br>  and in 1-3 tries we got a dau in 2005<br>  everything is possible in this world.<br>  good luck
6LxXR61Waa	It doesn't sound like implantation cramps, as those would occur closer to your "expected" period or a few days before.  It sounds more like ovulation cramps.
627pWyVkaa	you cant read a pregnancy test after 10 minutes the result you see is valid so the one that had nothing was just a faulty test or not enough urine on it. Try testing one more time and maybe do it in a cup to make sure it stays in the urine long enough. Remember all readings after 10 minutes are not valid and mean nothing. since your bleeding now you probably are not pregnant. and Since you went to mexico unless you had the vaccination for dur something its a bacteria u can get in foreign countries through water, fruit that can cause diarrhea and vomiting known as travelers diarrhea sounds more like what you had|`|Lck9Fg04aa	hmm well is the positive line the same colour as the control line?? if not it could be a evapouration line...<br>  <br>  it is possible to bleed and be on your period- it has happened to many woman. <br>  the only wasy to really know is to get yourself another test. test with 1st morning urine- thats when its the best<br>  <br>  good luck|`|gfudlB9Taa	No. It is not positive. It is evaporation line. Take another pregnancy test if still in doubt. Good luck|`|7fcL7pVUaa	Take another test and call a doc!!

AA12077420	It happened to me too,I had unprotected sex with my husband one day after my periods ended,then used morning after pills  but still got pregnant.|`|MmGTFuoTaa	Because your body just needs to be in perfect working order for you to get pregnant.. So.. whos to say that it cant be in that perfect state at any time??? Pregnancy is unpredictable. Some people fall pregnant after ten years of trying..|`|LL2dgYMUaa	i am asking myself the same question lol. my husband forgot to get my perscription we had unprotected sex within 2 days of my period ending around day 6 of my cycle thought we would be ok lol and no i am now 12 weeks pregnant with baby 5 lol. i think with me i ovulated early due to not taking the pill my body released an egg straight away.
c73QkZ2haa	How can Hemophilia be Detected? <br>  For people with a family history of Hemophilia, blood tests can be performed on the umbilical cord blood sample to see if a newborn baby has the illness. If the family desires, such tests can also be performed via amniocentesis before the baby is even born. However doctors will not perform these tests if there is no family history present. <br>  <br>  For children with mild to moderate Hemophilia, symptoms usually do not appear for quite some time. Boy babies with severe Hemophilia can be diagnosed if they have excessive bleeding post Circumcision. For most children with Hemophilia, unusual bleeding may be noticed when they begin to cut teeth or if they become excessively bruised after falls. <br>  <br>  For people with mild Hemophilia, they often do not have any symptoms until they undergo a dental procedure, surgery or are injured in an accident which causes them to bleed heavily. <br>  <br>  <br>  >They clamp the umbilical cord so that it cannot bleed or any baby would bleed alot. Its a huge bundle of veins. It can only be diagnosed thru amniocentesis which not many people do since it carries the risk of miscarriage. Most babies do not bleed or get cut during birth. Their are no sharp edges in the womb or the vagina. It is usually diagnosed later in life or if severe during circumcision for boys.
wNtW1hXLaa	How exciting!<br>  <br>  If you leave it up to your guests you are likely to get a whole bunch of  little things like clothes, toys, photo frames and other keepsakes but really lovely and special ones that you probably wouldn't have bought yourself. That's what I did. I have haven't had to buy many clothes or anything for my 3 month old to play with so far. If you want to get more practical stuff then it is advisable to get a registry - maybe there is an online company. You can chose a whole range of products in different price ranges, some cute, others more of a neccesity. That way you avoid the awkwardness of telling people what to buy and you don't end up with 3 of the same thing. <br>  <br>  Given the long distance that you family will have to travel and the lack of stores in your area, maybe you could just ask for money or a gift certificate and that way you can decide how to spend it. <br>  <br>  The essentials are:- pram, change table, baby bath, baby lotions, diapers and bag, cot and mattress, sheet sets and blanket (for your size cot), clothes, car seat and window shade. <br>  <br>  Other items that you could also benefit from are:- childrens books and books about looking after your baby, relaxation and play music cds, play mat, baby monitor (with sound and vision), toys, wall hangings for baby room, bouncer or swing, mobile, high chair.|`|qKX74n3iaa	diapers and wipes not to mention onsies and sleepers those are the best things|`|DTrqM46taa	Go to a baby store and create a baby shower registry list
ENl3pqnGaa	they work hard though because in the end it's worth it. reproduction is the main purpose of animal existence. but you however should not have children. you are emo and as such are too much of a wanker to breed others like you.|`|OxFV92hJaa	Yes it is, if you desire to never have kids...or if you are a selfish person that want's to go out and do whatever any hour of day/night with no responsibility.<br>  <br>  Many people that have kids (statistically over 80%) did not plan that child. So they simply "deal", which is the type you describe...same ones that thin it is "ok" to hit the bar twice a week and pay someone to take care of their kids so they can have a "good time".<br>  <br>  If you have a child that means:<br>  You are 100% responsible for a human life that relys on you for anything and everything 24/7 for 18 years legally, the reast of your life morally.|`|Q8wDjvZ1aa	yes it would obviously be easier not to have them.  people who really want kids don't have them because they are easy.    they have them because they have the want to love and be loved by a child, to help someone grow and learn, and all of these things are so rewarding.  i think it is important that people out there who do not want kids, or who are not sure, should not have them.  that creates problems for the rest of us.|`|GDnJYq0Aaa	no kids bring a joy to me|`|DDFSITiYaa	Of course it is easier not to have kids!  That's what makes it so ironic when the non-kid people think parents are 'selfish' for having kids!  <br>  <br>  I never thought I wanted kids.  I was on the fast track in the corporate world, finished college, graduate degree, several awards and professional titles and certificates on the wall.  Then we had baby #1. And then #2, and #3.  It all changed.  I traded all the corporate stuff for doing ABCs and cheering at soccer games.  <br>  <br>  Is it worth it?  Well, there are ups and downs and nothing in the corporate world prepares you for the job of being a parent.  But I have experienced more joy, more exuberance and really awakened to what life is all about.  It isn't just about the kids but it is about living each day and getting the most of of life.  I have become a different and more fulfilled person because of being a parent.  And I have only just begun.|`|PLeFgKEHaa	Children are a center of happiness... have kids... when you obviously have some money. Yea you can go out with your spouse more often and what not, but your life in my opinion would begin to become dull. Children fire the lives of most people in this world.

In my opinion, nothing worthwhile is easy but to each his own.<br>  <br>  There are parents like you describe, but they are certainly not all like that and that does NOT have to be the case.  Life is all about priorities, and if you don't prioritise work or career, then you don't have to make that choice.  <br>  <br>  And how do you know they are unhappy?   Did they tell you that, or are you making assumptions?

Some people are so short-minded it isn't even funny.  That article almost makes me angry.  It's history, whatever the subject is about, it happened and you can't change it.  They teach history in schools, those parents needed to get over it.<br>  <br>  Edit:  They were young however, at 8 or 9 I might be a little skeptic also.

This is a new world and children have to learn about(notice i didn't say experiment) different sexualities. This world is forever changing and i feel its good to learn about other lifestyles.

Why would you not want your child to learn about homosexuals just because they are homosexual? Lets not teach about black people or women or anyone who wasn't a christian either! Oh, wait that means most of the founding fathers would be left out of history too. Ooops. If your version of morality is to hate or alienate others you need a serious reality check. These people should get a life and realize that humans are all the same in every single point that MATTERS. We all hope, dream, hurt, suffer, laugh, create and die. If you must condemn someone let it be because of the harm they cause others not because their lifestyle upsets your delicate sensibilities.|`|c4d179c54efba1c73a993ab6f248346aaa	I feel if there is a program in the class that the parents object to then they have the right to take there child out of that class for the day.. and not get in trouble for it..|`|AA12221392	I beleive the parents should have a right if it goes against their religion. <br>  <br>  I think that it should be taught though because so many kids are being killed and people in general because of their right to be gay. This is also their right but so many people infringe upon it, because it is not right to them. <br>  <br>  I do think educationg our youth about the difference in all aspects of life is something we need to do, but if the parents are totally against it then it should be left up to them. <br>  While this is more of a religion aspect, where do we as a society draw the line to just religion beliefs and just because they think it is wrong and are prejudice . I mean do we stop teaching about black history, or hitler, or the many other conterversial cases in our history, there has to be a line but where that line is I am really not sure.|`|FVD1tpLeaa	They're teaching gay history, not gay sex and pornography.  Would you pull your children out if they were teaching black history?  Its the history of a culture, and people are doing their children a disservice by not allowing them to learn the history that went on in their own country.  I'm sure it's going to be up to my and my wife to teach our children about Stonewall, and Harvey Milk, and the history of pride, because so many schools are afraid of what parents will do because they might teach their children *gasp* the truth!|`|1tmX7xbRaa	why do people make such a big deal about his stuff? just let the schools teach them what they think is necessary. it's just like not saying the pledge of allegiance in schools because the lyrics include 'in god we trust'... just because they are teaching the children about different types of people and relationships DOES NOT mean that they are forcing them to be that way. just like because the pledge of allegiance says 'in god we trust' DOES NOT mean they are forcing someone to believe in one specific god or any god at all. seriously people get a reality check.i think that schools are smart enough to know what's ok to teach and whats not. does this mean that in health class kids won't learn the dangers of drugs because they might someday use them? give me a break<br>  oh and as a parent myself i wouldn't pull my kid out of class because 'it;s against our religion' or because ' i don't believe in that stuff' because then that will teach my children to reject things that they may not believe in or agree with and i think that is wrong. i think that teaches children that it's ok to be close minded and prejudice.  i don't like how the egyptians lived so i  am going to pull my kid out of school because i don't want her to learn about it or i am a fat slob and don't believe in physical education (like gym class) so i will pull my kid out of every gym class so she can be fat and lazy like me.... is it just me or doesn't that sound ridiculous?! (that's just an example of course)|`|cYRZpGkqaa	Honestly, maybe in high school. I know that they will already know about it by then. Or maybe leave it up to the parents. We talk to our kids about sex when the time is right, we could talk to them about homosexuality as well. I don't really know. It's a can of worms to open up.|`|rBq189W1aa	For a start, my children don't go to school in the UK, so it's not happening in their schools.<br>  <br>  If we allow parents to start dragging their kids out of class any time an 'objectionable' subject comes up, where will it end? Will white supremacists be able to take their kids out of school if they're being taught about the Civil Rights Movement? Will neo-Nazis be allowed to keep their kids home so that they don't learn that the Holocaust was a bad thing?<br>  <br>  Gay people exist. Gay people have always existed. Learning about them won't make your kids gay, which is what these people are probably so worried about. It will probably make them more accepting, which is what a lot of these parents are really afraid of; "How can we teach our kids to hate, if the schools are teaching them not to?"<br>  <br>  If kids are old enough to learn about heterosexual relationships through stories ("And the beautiful princess and the handsome prince lived happily ever after!"), why are they not old enough to learn about same-sex relationships as well?|`|ENl3pqnGaa	i believe that it's perfectly acceptable. it's not like they're talking about the way gay people have sex or anything that is actually age inappropriate. the way to gain acceptance is through understanding and the way to gain understanding is through education. if children are allowed to hear about heterosexual relationships then why not homosexual ones.|`|AA10236694	i would 100% except it .our children learn so many negative stereo types at school why not finally set the record str8.Its a fact that our children go to school with other children who have parents of different lifestyles and our children should be taught at school as well as at home to be excepting and loving of all families. Do we teach our children to be loving of biracial families ? yes we do so how is there any difference!|`|zK1V9Mu7aa	I would not want my child being taught such things at such an early age to be honest.

Ldvi6UPOaa	Wow I was going to ask the same question. I go in for a scan on Friday to check for follicles. So I was wondering what size they need to be.I look forward to the answers you get.<br>  <br>  Are they going to give you a trigger shot or are they hoping you ovulate on your own?|`|ApyrV5J9aa	13 is too small to ovulate. When you're on clomid the higher the better-usually once it has reached 18mm or more. The month I finally got pregnant (on clomid and an IUI) we couldn't see my right ovary, but we saw 2 follicles measuring 13 & 14 mm on my left ovary. I was told it should still be several more days because they grow a couple mm every two days. Two days later we checked again and saw one measuring 28mm on my right ovary. The ultrasound tech said to schedule the IUI for that night or the next morning. We did the next day. My charting said I ovulated the same day as the IUI as well. I found out I was pregnant 12 days later. If you are at 13 I would think that it will be at least another 5-6 days for you, but remember to do OPKs or whatever else you are doing to check for ovulation. Best of luck to you!|`|tSKBsbIyaa	Hey i am going through the same phase.<br>  Generally after stimulation, ovary should be at least 14mm or more, that is when they trigger HCG shot. You can expect ovulation withing a day or two. Even with out a shot, you can expect ovulation after about 16-18mm size. That actually depends upon individual. You can check with your general symptoms of ovulation like, cramps or back ache..<br>  Good luck
GOgVaXXKaa	Hi,<br>  Please don't waste the tests by taking on at 2 DPO!!! You will not produce any HcG until the embryo has implanted- whihc occurs anywhere between about 6-12 days, with 7-9 days the most common. Only then will your body begin producing the pregnancy hormone. <br>  However if you're about 7/8 DPO (if AF is due 16th I'm guessing you are) then these may be accurate- but only with first morning urine, or very concentrated dark pee. However remember that HCG doubles about every 48 hours, and the average at 14DPO is around a 100, making it 50 at 12DPO and only 25 at 10DPO- therefore even if you are pregnant at 8 DPO there is only about 12.5miu of HCG in your system which may be too early for a test to pick up. <br>  <br>  It's best to try and wait until at least 12DPO but loads of pregnant women will get a BFP at around 10DPO, with some (but not many) getting a BFP at around 8DPO. Anythign lower than that won't be reliable and you'll end up wasting your tests!|`|H74F8jxuaa	I think that you shouldn't be too disappointed if you get a negative this early.  I wouldn't trust the result until the 16th at the earliest.  I agree the tww stinks, but testing too early doesn't always have its advantages.  Best of luck and I added you to my contacts.|`|Ka52nbhNaa	Nothing works at 2dpo - not even a blood test!  At 2 days past ovulation (assuming that you calculated ovulation accurately) implantation has not even occured and your body would not be producing hcg.  On average implantation occurs 7 - 10 days past ovulation - at this point, your body would start producing hcg pretty quickly.<br>  <br>  Some women believe that blood tests and pregnancy tests that detect 5miu (more sensitive than the ones that you have) can be used as early as 7 days past ovulation . . . but in the real world, the earliest tends to be around 9 days . . . not as bad as waiting the full 2 weeks . . . but not as quick as 2 days!<br>  <br>  Good luck and loads of baby dust to you!|`|4jFFI8Zwaa	hey good luck!<br>  <br>  I bought some of they 10 miu tests and cant wait to start testing from the end of this month!!  8 month we have been trying, had fell in oct but had mc at Xmas so back on the baby dancing bandwagon!!  Roll on ovulation day!
PAJfrdWxaa	A birth control pill needs to be taken at the same time everyday. EVERY DAY. for the best possible protection. <br>  Maybe it was because you were not on it long enough.<br>  Or, were you on any type of medication like an antibiotic that can hinder its effectiveness, because that is also a popular reason the pill sometimes fails.|`|97JwSvUzaa	Birth control, if taken correctly, is only about 99% effective. This means that there is a 1 in 100 chance of getting pregnant while on the pill. If you do not take your BC pills correctly (if you miss pills or take them at different times every day), then the effectiveness of the pill is even less than that. So, even if you take them as you are supposed to there is a chance of getting pregnant, even though it is very slim.|`|c73QkZ2haa	Give him the box and a information pamphlet that says     99% effective and say congratulations were that one percent......<br>  In a study of 100 women in typical use of the pill 5 became pregnant. In perfect use 1 became pregnant...If not used totally perfect your chances go from 99% to 95%....Follow the link.|`|cEtxBb7taa	what everyone is saying is true...I'm sure you've said this to him already.  The way the birth control pill works is it PREVENTS ovulation. While taking the pill it maintains a level of a certain hormone that prevents your body from secreting the LH to stimulate ovulation  Basically it tricks your body into thinking you are pregnant.  When you are on you off week/placebo week those hormone levels drop drastically and you start your period.  Anytime you miss your pill or are late taking your pill you allow those hormone levels to drop some.  If that happens in the middle of your cycle (or really at any point in your cycle) it can cause your body to stimulate the release of LH that causes ovulation.  If you ovulate...and you have sex...you can get pregnant...|`|GxJL9UjVaa	I know a woman who got pregnant twice with TWINS while on the pill. it can defo happen.<br>  <br>  The doc told her she was so fertile that if she hadnt been on the pill she may have had 3 or 4 babies at the one time!!lol|`|C3cH7RALaa	his doubt is really fine.<br>  sometimes pills can't stop being prig.<br>  but r u sure u were using  pills as protection on every sex attempt ?????????????<br>  or .............................???????????...<br>  rest of all u know better what u did|`|f5z2wpAwaa	The same thing happened to me.

And maybe there are girls checking you out, just you dont notice ;-p<br>  <br>  You don't sound depressing, to me, i think you're lucky that you don't have to deal with the whole teenage love thing - get your heart broken etc etc etc. If they leave you out of the conversation than maybe try and involve yourself.. Don't act asthough you are trying to hard to get involved. If they're talking about something you life than join in on it. Maybe they leave you out because they don't think you want to be involved and would rather sit there.

You might feel left out now but you only have a few more years of school and then you should graduate with higher marks then everyone else because you arent wasting your time pretending to be in a serious relationship. As time comes you will start to notice girls (or guys) and then you can start to have those long nights laying in bed awake after you have a big dramatic fight over something pointless just because thats what most relationships at younger ages are.
zdWDkadraa	I think because it's the natural hormones that make us start to want to have sex, and be curious about sex. Of course, there is also the media which glorifies it, but I don't think that's the "problem," personally.<br>  <br>  It's only changed in the last couple generations to wait so long. Even in my grandmother's generation, her and most of her friends started having children around 16. I think it's the natural age to want sex-lead to pregnancy, but now society deems it wrong. So I guess the cause is lack of birth control then, because sex at a young age isn't going to stop.<br>  <br>  Sorry I couldn't put that into very good words, but you get the idea.|`|398587d073be2044e73ae194ff808b61aa	Wanting to feel like they're adult before they're ready and responsible enough to take precautions.<br>  <br>  Thinking a baby is a fun thing to have around, that it'll be all giggles and smiles and the dirty diapers won't stink and they'll magically be fed, clothed and someone will always babysit when Mom goes out.<br>  <br>  Getting pressured into having sex on the spur of the moment so no one had protection.<br>  <br>  Intentionally getting pregnant to have someone to love.<br>  <br>  Getting pregnant to try and keep a boyfriend/ get married/ get out of the house.<br>  <br>  Improper use of birth control.

Hormones, biology, curiosity, etc.  Although I agree with religious conservatives who want to challenge the youth to delay sexual activity for a while, I totally disagree with their message that a condom is a provision for sin. I send my Christian friends to the website below which debunks the whole thing against premarital sex in the Bible. That way they have no excuse not to support comprehensive sex education.|`|mzFUWq8iaa	i had sex as a teenager because we loved each other (only one guy who is now my husband). i really never understood why so many girls in my high school were prego, seeming how i 'did the deed' all the time and we never even got scared. i think some girls (and guys) think it wouldnt happen to them or they just are stupid enough to skip the protection. also, parents could be the problem. i knew a girl who asked her mom to get her on bc when she was 15 and the mom said no because she was too young to be having sex. well, 5 months later the mom wished she had listened to her daughter. so there are many different reasons as to why it happens.|`|I7ktUFQfaa	Trying to be cool, not understanding how serious sex can be, being uneducated.|`|JWp9PMyRaa	-wanting someone to love them<br>  -attention<br>  -irresponsible<br>  -or just carelessness|`|PLbmKNpvaa	Five simple words. <br>  <br>  "It won't happen to me".

I have a diaper fetish as well but you have to stop making yourself out to look like a freak and an idiot.|`|E9JigTskaa	have you looked into a catheter.<br>  <br>  re diapers: how about giving him a days worth at the beginning of each day and reminding him that he is responsible for making them last the day (keep back the night time one), that way if he messes up it's only one day at a time.<br>  and he is still learning how to manage for himself.|`|gs2aPltGaa	this is a hard question to tackle given tge circumstance.<br>  <br>  For a 10 yr old boy to have to ask his parents for a diaper may be hard to do, embaressing even. And those diapers by all means are not cheap. 12 to 15 diapers a day is an awful lot.... So I feel you.<br>  <br>  Im just not sure how I can give you advice that will help you keep his independence. He is already past the age where he hates being wet.. We spend all that time teaching our toddler that sitting in a dry diaper is better than sitting in a wet diaper and thats why you should use the toilet, and in his case he went back to being in a diaper after hes already accomplished the toilet part. :o(  Thank goodness he can fully recover.<br>  <br>  But being 10 years old I am pretty sure he is feeling a little self conscious, maybe worried he might smell of urine. So my only advice for a little relief is to seek a flexible spending account offered through your place of employment. because its a medically needed product you will be able to claim it through this account. That and costco/sams clubs have adult size continence garders in multiple sizes which may be cheaper than buying them from a regular store.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|wyKYtJ8baa	Just wondering if you have taken him to a doctor about his urine control?<br>  <br>  <br>  ADD:<br>  Have you thought about using pads? They are cheaper then nappies. I guess you could test them and see if they work for him. But if it's too much urine I guess nappies would be the best way.<br>  <br>  Another way you could possibly reduce the amount of urine is to teach him Kegel Exercises (added a link in source).<br>  <br>  *Sorry if you think theses are really stupid ideas or you have already tried them. Just trying to help*<br>  <br>  Maybe you could also just give him diapers at school/sleeping but at home he has to use the toilet. There is nothing wrong with going to the toilet a lot at home because it doesn't interrupt learning. Does he know if he needs to go?<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|ybexjS2Paa	Maybe it would be a good idea to take him to the toilet for example every half an hour and make him use it. If he can't control his bladder then there's not much you can do. Of course he feels uncomfortable in a wet diaper and that is probably why he changes them so often. Best think it's to keep reminding him about going to use the toilet, it would be kind of like potty training. Sorry but I have no other idea what you could do. Good luck.|`|6nn7f41Faa	Troll.

1xsUVtzBaa	Here's a lot of what you have described, hope you get the big fat positive at your doctors! Good luck + Baby dust *<br>  <br>  The Early Signs of Pregnancy Symptoms Checklist-<br>  <br>  The following are common early signs of pregnancy. However, symptoms of pregnancy are not the same for every woman. In fact, your own symptoms may actually be different from one pregnancy to another. <br>  Pregnancy symptoms can also vary in their intensity, frequency and duration. The following early signs and symptoms of pregnancy checklist is only a guideline.<br>  <br>  Also keep in mind that many of the earliest pregnancy symptoms can appear similar to routine pre-menstrual discomforts. <br>  <br>  If you are not trying to conceive, you might think it is just your period coming on again, when in reality you may be experiencing very early signs of pregnancy. <br>  <br>  If you are trying to conceive, you may be frustrated when you think you may be experiencing early symptoms of pregnancy but they are only pre-menstrual symptoms.<br>  <br>  You will experience a wide variety of physical and emotional changes during pregnancy. These may include any or all of the pregnancy symptoms listed below. <br>  <br>  Although each of these are considered typical early symptoms of pregnancy, they may happen earlier or later than the order in which they appear on the following list. <br>  <br>  Remember, some of the earliest signs of pregancy may be subtle, not obvious. Whenever there is any question that you might be experiencing early signs of pregnancy, do a home pregnancy test. <br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #1<br>  <br>  <br>  Missed Period<br>  <br>  Perhaps the most obvious early symptom of pregnancy is when you've missed your period. This possible sign of pregnancy is often what causes women to search for more details about the other pregnancy symptoms. <br>  <br>  Some women might only experience a much lighter period compared to their usual. You might not experience any of the pregnancy signs listed below until around the time you notice you've missed your monthly cycle. <br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #2<br>  <br>  <br>  Just "Feeling" Pregnant<br>  <br>  This early pregnancy symptom may be the reason why you are checking this list right now. Many women believe they have an intuition about pregnancy signs. Their intuition is often proven correct. <br>  <br>  Maybe you just feel different; tired, moody, queasy, lightheaded. You may also have heartburn, constipation, or find yourself making more frequent trips to the restroom. Perhaps you feel a dull ache or stiffness in your lower back, you have sore breasts or they seem overly sensitive, or you are simply not feeling like your usual self. <br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #3<br>  <br>  <br>  Breast Tenderness<br>  <br>  One of the very noticeable early signs of pregnancy is tender, swollen, somewhat sore breasts. You may notice this pregnancy sign at bedtime when you are trying to get comfortable and go to sleep, when exercising or showering, or when getting dressed. <br>  <br>  When you become pregnant, your body begins preparing your breasts for producing milk and breastfeeding. Hormones start increasing. In addition to breast tenderness and swelling, your nipples may feel sore or extra sensitive. Some women notice their nipples darken in color. <br>  <br>  Your breasts play an important role in childbirth. They are naturally sensitive and become far more so when pregnant. This is one of the most obvious early symptoms of pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #4<br>  <br>  <br>  Fatigue<br>  <br>  One of the earliest pregnancy signs for some women may be fatigue and exhaustion. You may start going to bed sooner, or find it harder than usual to get out of bed in the morning. If you are working, by noon you may feel like you need to lie down. Exercising seems like too much effort. A simple activity like shopping may leave you feeling wiped out and lightheaded. This early pregnancy symptom is caused by all of the changes that your body is going through, plus the increasing levels of hormones. <br>  <br>  If you know you are pregnant, try to take frequent rests or naps of 15 minutes to a half-hour whenever possible. Explain to your family, friends and coworkers that you need these naps. Ask for their help in blocking out rest times for you.<br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #5<br>  <br>  <br>  Frequent Urination<br>  <br>  An early symptom of pregnancy that others may notice you experiencing is frequent trips to the restroom. Your family or friends may comment that you seem to be going off to the ladies room quite often lately. One cause of this pregnancy symptom is that the swelling uterus can put pressure on your bladder.<br>  <br>  Also, pregnancy causes extra body fluids to be processed by your kidneys and bladder. That means more trips to the restroom. Sorry to have to say this, but this symptom of pregnancy may remain constant for nine months. <br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #6<br>  <br>  <br>  Nausea<br>  <br>  One of these pregnancy signs of queasiness, nausea and vomiting can take you by surprise when you least expect it. These early pregnancy symptoms may come as soon as a week into the pregnancy. Many wom|`|hcwp2mAyaa	If ur anxious to know why not go buy a DIY pregnancy test and do it now?|`|398587d073be2044e73ae194ff808b61aa	If you're only a few weeks pregnant the flutters are probably gas.<br>  <br>  Definitely see a doctor or take a test.

20117c2d24d216a72c5b973e9d412b2caa	I guess, on a primal level, it would be perfectly natural to feel such things considering all "sex" is meant to be is a form of reproduction and most mammals (aside from humans) will mate w/anything that walks by. However, as human beings, we have been programmed to repress such urges due to the fact that as intelligent, thinking beings, we know the repercussions of such actions (deformities, mutations, mental retardation, etc). If you or anyone you know has such feelings either repress them or tell the person you are inquiring for to repress them, because in our society it is "inappropriate".|`|AA10720794	If you can think it up it probably exists.<br>  It could be from loneliness, maybe a disorder but there have been cases where mothers sleep with sons.<br>  I would say that 98% of mothers just see their children as offspring and the thought of having sexual relationships with them is just out of the question. But the mind wanders and due to upbringing or just how a person is I'm sure it does happen.<br>  Hope this helped.|`|AazkuVzqaa	Unfortunately, there are many mothers who have those types of feelings towards their sons.

A unique spelling would be Ashleigh. I think it describes her character well and It sounds great. It you want last names too then I would Have Ashley/Ashleigh Green or Ashly/Ashleigh Melody.<br>  Another name could be Colleen! It's an Irish name and I really think it is awesome! A unique spelling could be Kolleen. And last name could be Sunny or Spinners. Find a really unique name that you could mix  together! Also Destinee fits well!<br>  Jasmin is nice!<br>  <br>  #2 Trevor is what the first name I noticed! Or Vince! That just fits because I knew someone with longish hair and he fits the description perfectly. Last name could be Bradford. Collen goes well with colleen. Last name could be Choen.. <br>  Cameron would  work as #1 or #2 and that would be a nice name!<br>  <br>  #3 I like Mackenzie Adison!!! That would fit perfectly! Or Laura MacRae.

LTD0qL6Yaa	Your story sounds just like mine. I was 3 DPO and i felt like i needed to go but couldn't, then 7 DPO i was starting to get desparate. I went to the chemist and asked for somethig that was safe to take during pregnancy (just in case i was) and they gave me COLOXYL tablets. They are a laxitive but also have a softner in it. It is perfectly safe to take. I'm now 7 weeks pregnant and i am still taking them every few days, i have never been this constipated in my life!! Good luck and yes this was my very first symptom. Baby dust to you...|`|rmse6Mj8aa	ok on its own, no its not a reliable sign to indicate pregnancy. <br>  if it persists throughout the rest of the horrible 2ww, then you can definitely consider it a sign. it is common for one of the first signs of pregnancy to be constipation due to the surge of progesterone.<br>  <br>  one of the other people to answer this qu did point out that progesterone rises after ovulation anyway so that could be why you are suffering at 6dpo.<br>  if it carries on take it as a sign<br>  fertility friend has a pregnancy sign estimator - its quite fun you could have a look. <br>  <br>  aloe vera tablets are a great natural way to help with constipation - or you can try taking more probiotics. they help maintain a healthy gut and aid in preventing constipation.<br>  <br>  i hope that you get your bfp soon. <br>  anyone who can see constipation as a promising sign deserves some good news!<br>  xx|`|RE6GBw0Baa	well hunni all i can say is when i was pregnant i was horribly constipated, oh my, lol.<br>  <br>  cant remember when it started though sorry hun, but of course it could be a sign<br>  <br>  i really hope u get ur bfp soon huni xxxx|`|2nfMSDiPaa	Hey hun, Im in the same boat as you!!im constipated too...lol!!but Im NOT taking as pregnancy sign!!because when af arrives i will be tears!!<br>  <br>  Hope me and you both get BFP!!!God willing!|`|1xsUVtzBaa	Constipation is another common early symptom of pregnancy. An increase of Progesterone causes food to pass more slowly through the intestines, which can lead to constipation.<br>  The problem may later be compounded by the pressure of the growing uterus on the rectum. Iron supplements can make constipation worse.<br>  Which if your taking a prenatal vitamin, you may have noticed.<br>  Drink plenty of water and up your fibre intake. A good source of fibre is fruit juice.<br>  Good luck and baby dust *|`|4HcDAR49aa	in both my pregnancies, when i was about 2 (4) weeks pregnant (before i was actually aware i was pregnant) i constantly suffered from constipation then diarrhoea. it was these symptoms with my second pregnancy that made me think i was pregnant.  However, please take this with a pinch of salt, as there are many causes for constipation. Good luck|`|4RXrYac9aa	After ovulation the lead hormone is progesterone, progesterone is known to cause constipation.<br>  So no this isn't a early pregnancy symptom its just a symptom of post ovulation.<br>  I hope you get what you wish for<br>  <br>  Baby dust +++<br>  <br>  Jodie xxx|`|3aV4lcCqaa	hi hon i got constipated at 4.5 weeks - i am 5wks today and got some pink mucas when i wiped and period pains so i have rushed home from work to put my feet up! so scared.<br>  good luck, i hope that the constipation is from a little bean that is about to grow inside.<br>  <br>  goodluck keep in touch xx|`|WnlzScIyaa	I started getting constipation around 8 or 9 dpo.

When I was pregnant with my son. . . I was incredibly constipated.  It was AWFUL.  My husband actually had to stick this thing up my behind.  (I can't remember what they are called, but it's this squirty bottle and it helps loosen it.)  I remember telling him, that's when you know they love you!  Haha!!!<br>  <br>  But yes.  I was very very constipated around that time frame.|`|W0AK2Lumaa	Just realx
5OfqaVxyaa	There is less recovery time when the man has it done but in my case my insurance covered it all. My husbands insurance would not. They went through my belly button and when I left recovery I felt fine. Once I got home my tummy was a bit sore. The second day I walked around a bit to keep from getting stiff. The third day I was feeling better and resumed most of my activities. It was the tiniest mark, you could barly notice. Just make sure you have thought this thru and talk to your Dr. He can help releive your worries. Its not as bad as you might think! The only problem I had was weight gain.|`|Y7LGS6V1aa	Well, having a surgery isn't half as bad or scary as you think. Being put to sleep is quite possibly the best feeling in the world and you wake up not even knowing you went in the OR to begin with. If you have your tubes tied, that means no more period. Ultimately, it is a decision both you and your husband have to make. Whatever you are most comfortable with.|`|T8ksKCWCaa	A vasectomy is far less invasive, with a shorter recovery time.|`|gPg7qYGIaa	for w2hat i read vasectomy's are more reliable and safer

I also put a photocopy of my ultrasound picture in it too! <br>  <br>  I just put an entry in on a weekly basis and would put how I was feeling (good or bad) and mentioned things like shopping for furniture for the baby etc. I also mentioned my babyshower and all the people who came and what gifts I recieved. I'm glad I did that because I had forgotten who gave what and I referred back to it!<br>  <br>  I have started another journal up for my 2nd pregnancy (I'm 9.5 weeks).

Ow6lKFXiaa	Ok. You've already got lots of good and some not so good advice. I can't add much except my own experience. My son traveled internationally from 3 months to 4 years. We never had a problem and being Autistic made him more prone to problems, so we did something right. He still flies well at 17 even though he's become more sensitive.  We still use the same methods we did when he was a child. (Minus the bassinet, bottles, and binky of course.) We also taught him the proper rules of flying behavior and enforce those rules.<br>  <br>  If you can, request a bulkhead seat and a bassinet. They hook onto the wall in front of the bulkhead seat.  This allows you extra room to care for him, he isn't totally surrounded by strangers and the stranger anxiety that comes at this age, and you can lay him down for a comfortable nap when he needs it which will also give your arms a break.<br>  <br>  Unless you're breastfeeding, you’ll need several bottles of formula and juice and a couple of binkies (pacifier).   Ready-to-mix formula packets work best because you don’t need to refrigerate and you can lighten your load by getting bottled water from the flight attendant.  Save at least two for takeoff and landing. The sucking action will help relieve ear pressure which is the major reason babies cry on planes.<br>  <br>  Bring new and colorful toys to distract him. If his attention is elsewhere, he won't be as anxious. Take him for frequent walks up and down the aisle showing him things, like the bathroom and kitchen area (if they allow). He won't know what he's looking at but he'll be fascinated.<br>  <br>  Don't let strangers hold him. In fact, try not to let them talk to him or touch him. Explain that you don't mean to be rude but he's at that age of stranger anxiety and you don't want to upset him.  This will also cut down on his catching germs. Airplanes are almost as bad as a doctor's office for picking up illness as they are closed environments.<br>  <br>  You need to remain calm and soothing no matter how stressed you get. Don't expect the flight to be enjoyable...settle for tolerable and uneventful. You're going to be in the air for 10-16 hours, it's going to be tough.<br>  <br>  As for swimming, he's way too young for any type of floatation device. Even with supervision accidents can happen. Most hotels in Europe and the US will have a toddler wading pool or shallow end to the big pool. Use baby formulated sunscreen in the highest SPF you can find. A water proof diaper cover (use disposable diapers under the cover, not cloth). Make sure he has a fresh diaper just prior to getting into the water and change it often.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps make your trip easier on all of you and your fellow passengers.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Oops! I forgot to mention that he should wear a hat in the sun, preferably an infant/toddler safari hat which has a flap that covers the neck. Also a light t-shirt to protect his sholders and torso.|`|KzXv8ZKEaa	don't do it .Last year i was in menorca i watched couples with young babies argue as to who was going to take the baby into the hotel because it was to hot,they usually only spent an hour or so outside,the babies were constantly crying because of the heat.I took my sons to spain when they were older the youngest was 5 yrs old.Think of your babies skin and well being i personally think people with very young babies should holiday at home,especially now the euro is worth nothing.|`|b5ad647e650145ed40fca25e90dfec59aa	Go to this website where you will find many tips for your holiday.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flyingwithkids.com/travel_tips.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.flyingwithkids.com/travel_tip...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  I am going to Hong Kong with my 8month old son this October (he will be 15 months old by then)|`|iMaTMWMxaa	It depends who you're flying with, but some do let you go to the front of the queue to get settled first, but I have also been on some that don't.<br>  <br>  Check it out, and if you can check in online do it. Do everything you can to make it easier. Pack one bag of hand luggage all for your son, with his favourite toys, and favourite biscuits or other things to keep him quiet!! lol<br>  <br>  Make sure he is eating/sucking something on take off, for the ear popping. We made sure we had spare dummies for my daughter which seemed to help. <br>  <br>  Wish me luck also, as in July I'm taking all 3 of mine on a 24 hour flight. The eldest is 5 lol. Or maybe as someone else suggested I shouldn't take them, and they should never have the joy of meeting their family....hmmmmm. I think I might just go anyway :)|`|mWcuoSyxaa	Make u take loads of sun cream for him and wet wipes to keep him cool|`|282a6319def08c9536ee77d12721bce3aa	Take toys with you on the flight or even crayons and paper, i know he is only 8 mths but he will love it. when the plane goes up, if he has a dummy make sure he is sucking it or if not just chat and coo to him holding his ears - the same when the plane goes down.<br>  Just dress him in his vest tops or t-shirts and shorts, complete must is a hat! But take warmer clothes for evening. He will be able to go into the pool with you or your husband, you could even buy him a sit in floatie that his legs come out of. buy swimming nappies (huggies are fab) he can just wear them in the pool with a t shirt over him. Complete sun block cream!<br>  <br>  i found that a sombrero on our pram and a clip on fan ideal for when we took our son away at 8 mths. Both were bought from mothercare.<br>  <br>  If breastfed fine but if not do do do not forget to take your milk with you and buy bottled water over there, i forgot to do this and it was an abs nightmare to find milk. Also make sure he has plenty of water and don't fret to much if his appetite is not good either it will just be the heat.<br>  <br>  Have a fab time.|`|4jFFI8Zwaa	Hey<br>  <br>  Dont worry to much about going away with a baby! Its not so hard!  You should get him one of those all in one UV sunsuits, they will cover his arms and legs as the sun will be too strong for his skin!  Remember to pack a sunhat and factor 50 suncream! <br>  <br>  You will get first on the plane with him to get seated without the crush and you will be able to take the buggy on with you!<br>  <br>  You should get one of those rubber rings with the seat in it for him and im sure he will love the pool!  You should take him to the local swimming pool from now to get him used to the water! They can go at any age!|`|DcrGonO6aa	We just got back from vacation with our 3 month old... tips for the plane<br>  <br>  - Pack brand new toys... that will keep him occupied for a little while. Not the same old toys! (works with older kids too)<br>  - Tylenol or Gravol works well if needed<br>  - Soother or suck on thumb helps with the air press in their ears for take off and landing<br>  - Be patient at the airport and on the plane! you can't be in a rush when traveling with a child.<br>  - get to the airport early to move through security... not as easy with a little one<br>  - Respect other passengers - try your best to calm your child anyway possible if they have a melt down.<br>  <br>  - Dress your child in layers... and loose fitting clothes.

However, what about all those ADULT passengers with annoying coughs, ADULTS in the seat in front of you who insist on reclining their seats back til it's near touching the your nose. There are many things which some people choose to find annoying when travelling on public transport. It's your choice to let it annoy you. <br>  <br>  I've also been on plenty of flights where I've not heard a peep out of babies on board and also travelled with a party of friends one of whom had a 14 month old who behaved impeccably throughout the journey.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	Oh god, the inevitable taking a child away for the first time experience! Everyone dreads it.<br>  <br>  Here is how I coped with a 5 month old and then again when she was 14 months:<br>  <br>  FLIGHT:<br>  *If possible try and book him his own seat. If you can't don't worry, its only when babies get in to walking that this is really necessary.<br>  *Give him calpol just before you take off OR just before you land. Before landing is best (and you can't really do both with it being such a short flight) as that is the worst part for popping ears.<br>  *Pre pack plenty of juice/milk so you don't get ripped off on board.<br>  *Take crayons etc to entertain your little one (this actually entertained my partner too, oddly enough)<br>  *Take spare clothes for your little one and spare tops for you and your partner. Make sure the clothes your little one is wearing are easily removeable just incase the temperature drops/falls.<br>  <br>  DAYWARE:<br>  Little baby swimming trunks and light t-shirts are best. Topping up with factor 50 every 2 hours is essential and boots sell amazing baby sun tents that are compact so you can pop them up on any beach and your little one can play/sleep.<br>  <br>  POOL:<br>  Yes he most likely will. Wait until you get there to buy floatation devices too as there will be so many available in great colours/designs.<br>  <br>  SWIMSUIT:<br>  Buy two or three a long with swim pants. I have found debenhams and mothercare are best for swimsuits.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|o2H6DEHLaa	hi, that's great your  first holiday with the baby,just take few toys,and maybe favourite snack don't worry there will be plenty of other children making a fuss on the flight.<br>  try to take light Cotton cloths, my son was 6 months when we went to spain and i used mostly all in ones (short sleeves and short legs) since there are quite few fashionable ones and if he falls asleep he will be comfortable.<br>  sure you can take him to the pool he will love it.<br>  i would buy him swimming shorts ,i bet he will look cute.<br>  I have a major advice, go to boots before you go buy some  proper baby insect repellent,in spain there are so many mosquito's.<br>  apart from that try to enjoy yourself, don't bother to much if you fail the normal routine, remember the baby is on holidays to so he will love  a stroll in the busy night every once in a while. <br>  Oh also Spanish people are very child friendly so you can take your baby to every restaurant or small bar at night without any problems.<br>  have fun|`|B5MDTdtPaa	hey hun this is a great website for everything you need to know about taking a baby on a plane and on holiday and how to keep them cool, what sun protection to use etc etc<br>  <a href="http://www.babycentre.co.uk/baby/travel/travellingwithanewborn/" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycentre.co.uk/baby/travel/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.babycentre.co.uk/baby/travel/" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycentre.co.uk/baby/travel/</a>|`|373b04f6dbf649a6ef357e85b32df3e4aa	Hey!<br>  <br>  I took my son on holiday for his first birthday.<br>  <br>  It's really not as bad as you imagine, I was so worried about him getting sun stroke or sun burn, however he was fine! <br>  <br>  Yes you will be able to take him into the pool, just make sure you have factor 50 suncream, one of those all in one swimsuits, a parasol for the buggy, lot's of water/juice.<br>  <br>  We also carried one of those spray bottles, filled it up with water and kept spraying him (Make sure your suncream is water proof if you do this though) <br>  <br>  As we stayed in a caravan we were always quite close to our resources so we kept filling up his baby bath and sticking him in.<br>  <br>  Have a great holiday :) xxxx

However i did not fall pregnant, i did experience very heavy clotting and shorter periods,which reminded me of the miscarriage (thought i was miscarrying every month-but not sure)<br>  I think waiting is somewhat unrealistic but the plus side is your uterus builds up it's lining again and will be stronger for implantation purposes.  So after a few months maybe your cycle will return to normal and your body will be ready to carry a baby full term. If i were you just wait a month, see how your cycle is and then when ready try again. I am just using the cervical mucus observation method, as i have a very distinct few days mid cycle where i have egg white stretchy mucus..i've heard it's very effective (plus cost effective)..look it up on the net.<br>  Im trying now so i hope any day i get the BFP +<br>  Good luck and sticky dust to you x
2VdJgenjaa	My son is 6 and he is in the 5th percentile for his age. Our Doctor said (because I've been worried about it for years) that as long as his weight for his height is good we have nothing to worry about.<br>  <br>  Hahaha! I just realised that you are the same height as me and your husband the same as mine.<br>  <br>  Also my husband's dad and brother are shorter than me so we aren't really expecting our son to be to tall.<br>  <br>  My son still wears clothes I bout for him when he was 2.|`|jLYTKr33aa	I didn't have that problem, as my son has always been tall for his age.  His cousins, however, are tiny.  They're also bright, happy, and healthy children.<br>  Your son's pediatrician sounds like a moron.  He, of all people, should know that healthy children come in all shapes and sizes.  As long as your son is eating, sleeping, and otherwise developing well, I wouldn't worry in the least.  Doctors usually don't worry until a child is below the 5th percentile anyway.|`|C22jeMVhaa	My baby, who is 6 now, is only in the 6th percentile. She is only 36 pounds and 3'3".  I was always like that too. I grew up to be almost 5'3". Of course I'm the tallest woman in 3 generations so I guess I can't complain. My oldest was pretty short when she was younger, too. She is now slightly above average in height, so it really can go both ways.|`|20117c2d24d216a72c5b973e9d412b2caa	When my youngest was 18 months he was the size of a 9 mo, when he was 3 he was the size of an 18 month old, now he is ten and the size of an 8 year old. My children's doctor is more supportive, she says that since he has been small like this all his life it's his perfect size.|`|cteyFJxhaa	Well odds are that unless one of you has a giraffe for a parent he's not going to be 6 ft tall but who cares.  My stepson's 15 and still short but my son was small right up until grade 11 and is still growing at 19...just hit 5'11".<br>  <br>  He doesn't need to be tall to be strong and healthy.<br>  <br>  Add:  There you go then, maybe he does have the giraffe gene and may suddenly shoot through the roof at 15 yrs old.|`|VxHu4yBeaa	My son is 12 months old and he is short too. But the doctor says it is ok. He is only 26 inches long. The doctor said he would reach a growth spurt in a few months, just give it some time.|`|um29wkUPaa	Yes, but we factored in genetics early on.  With a 4'11 mother and a 5'8 father, we weren't expecting any basketball players :/|`|8g7hshqEaa	My daughter is 10 months old & is 30 inches tall. She is in the 98% for height, she's very tall for her age. <br>  <br>  It's something that just happens, im worried that shes going to be like 7'0" tall and i know she'll hate that. But what can we do? Eventually he'll hit a growth spurt, itll just take time. <br>  <br>  I'm 5'2", my husband is 6'0", my mom is 5'3", dad is 5'7", MIL is 5'10", & FIL is 5'7"<br>  <br>  <br>  My husband & I are TTC our second child & have a joke that if we have a boy he will probably be really short, since our daughter is soo tall, haha, so i may be in your shoes before long. Good luck!|`|kM3t3iDsaa	I've always been short for my age. Don't worry about it.<br>  <br>  My Doctors have made the comment, that our 3yo Twins are too tall for their age (they are the same height as their 5yo sibling).<br>  What am I supposed to do, put bricks on their heads??|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	It could very well change.  : )<br>  <br>  My oldest was always in the 50 percentile until his 3 year check up.  Then, he went to the 25th and now (at age 4) is in the 10th percentile.  I'm 5'7" and my husband is 5'9 (or 10)" but my dad and brothers are all 6' plus.  I'm thinking he is going to take after daddy (who's the tallest in his family) and my youngest is going to take after mine.  I think big brother will be looking up to talk to little brother, lol.  I guess only time will tell though.|`|bYhqPOtwaa	My son has always been around the 10th percentile in height and weight. My doc said he's not concerned, just looks like the little guy is going to get his height from me. Poor guy, I'm only 5'1", hubby is 5"11".|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	my son was short about 29 inches and some at almost 13 months  but he is now 36 inches and some and almost 23 months- why dodes your doctor want to see him taller. you don't have to be in the 50% to be normal and ok<br>  <br>   im just under 5'7 and his dad is only 5'8 but i think he'll be taller than daddy- im the shortest in my family- mother was 5'9 dad is 5'10 and my mother's brothers are all 6'2-6'6. my grandmother was 6'0. i got the short end of the stick|`|AA10494763	I have the opposite problem my daughter is two but in 5T clothing . She is has tall as 4 year old when we go to the park other parents look at her like she is slow because they think she is as old as she looks.   She is also very skinny so I thank GOD for adjustable waist. My son is only 8 months but is on the short side so we will see at the next appointment where he is .  <br>  There is nothing you can to to make him grow like i can't make her stop. Doc thinks she may be 6 feet tall.|`|3F8f1SoQaa	OK...here is the deal.<br>  <br>  If his growth curve is steady, then he is probably OK. My oldest son was "normal" until he was about 18 months old. From 18 months on he still grew, but his growth curve very slowly flattened. Every few years he would drop a percentile point. By the time he was 10.5 years old he had dropped off the bottom of the growth chart. We got involved in a program to rule out a handicapping condition. This program confirmed that he has a condition called idopathic short stature and he was treated with growth hormones for 2 years and grew quite a bit.<br>  <br>  basically you should ask your doctor for a referral to a pediatric endocrinologist. They will look at your son's growth chart, take a wrist x-ray, and do some blood tests. If he has any sort of hormonal issue it can be treated ASAP, if he is fine they will let you know.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	The 13th centile is perfectly normal - 13% of normal kids are shorter than he is! Why on earth would your doctor have said that - has he suddenly stopped growing or something?<br>  <br>  My short toddler is still short at 9 years old, I'm afraid :) I'm 5'2" and my husband is 6'4", so we are waiting to see whether he beanpoles when he hits adolescence or not :)
Ka52nbhNaa	Sounds like you are starting to feel the little ones!  That was right around the time that I could start to feel the occassional flutter with my twins!<br>  <br>  Congrats and best wishes - twins are such a blessing!|`|2jiNLOKHaa	18-22 weeks is when most moms start to feel those flutters. you have two inside so you may feel them sooner than most. you are probably feeling the babies move.|`|fAN8snFdaa	I'd say it is the movemnt you are feeling.<br>  <br>  I have twins and had this same thing from about 20 weeks. <br>  Torwards the end the tightness got quite tight  it was amazing to watch.<br>  <br>  If you have ANY concerns just speak to your midwife - since you are having twins they really do tend to treat you at a slightly 'higher risk' (for lack of a better term)<br>  <br>  Good luck.. you have a whole lot of fun ahead of you ;)|`|JXFYdTqmaa	its just your little ones moving about and trying to get comfy :), its def. nothing to worry about. wow twins, congrads xxxxxxxxxxx|`|0bSghnrtaa	It probably is the babies. Congratulations on the twins :)|`|KOx4QfRfaa	It's probably an alien clawing at your stomach, much like in the movie of the same name.
pcjLTnwTaa	I don't like Cassandra pronounced cass-on-dra...sounds pretentious.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I like all of your names.My favorite being Adrianna.My second Choice being Alexa.|`|mkT0PQ4Paa	Adrienne is nice, though I think she would just be called Adrian by most kids at school and stuff. Brianna is way too common now I think, Cassandra is really nice and ages well, Adrianna is ok but I don't really like it, and Alexa is too clipped to my way of hearing. :-)|`|V4FNh1Ofaa	Hi<br>  I think Adrianna and Cassandra would be constantly miss pronounced because of the A's in them.<br>  Alexa is nice, I prefer Alexis.. Because you can have the nickname Lexi.<br>  LOVE Brianna!<br>  <br>  If I have another girl next time I would like the name Brianna or Briella.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ITCknAHVaa	They sound nice, There are not really common, but are picking up into being used now.  It depends it you want a more uncommon name as they are in vogue now.  They are nice names but if you want unusual I would try other names.|`|Vs8oNT0oaa	Adrianna is perfect name.|`|VclfMe7uaa	Of the ones you posted, I prefer Adrianna and Alexa.|`|jUneJXEIaa	I love the names Alexa and Brianna, they are so pretty.|`|BdOqnSetaa	if they're twin...<br>  Adrianna n Adrienne will be nice...<br>  but, i think, Adrienne is a unique one.|`|fe71b8d4015587526215b587719bd2c2aa	i love cassandra thas one of my daughters name is beautiful!!!!|`|JG7ZSnikaa	cassie|`|Ir3XPq4raa	Sorry dont like them but if I HAD to pick one it would be Alexa!!!!!!
cYRZpGkqaa	You are sick. I answered you before thinking you were serious. You need some serious help. I can't believe this!|`|AA11537580	you already asked this question like a week ago|`|G8MD91FQaa	He was told the adult stuff very early and realized if the pup did that it was very pleasureful|`|fO1ZzPXyaa	Yea, you should have stopped him AND you should tell his parents. That's just nasty!
LUjCnYmoaa	why dont you call fisher-price and find out if they have it or maybe can suggest one that fits?|`|TqOdbhNAaa	It seems like it should.|`|J4uWjrZwaa	i think it will.
2jiNLOKHaa	no. if you are a week away yet, you may not have even had implantation. the crappy thing is that pms and early pregnancy symptoms are a lot alike. all you can really do is waite it out until you miss your period. i spent months and months in agony thinking every little sign was pregnancy. it makes it harder. when you try not to focus too much on those little twinges in the two week waite then time flyes by faster. i hope you get your bfp here in a few days. good luck!!|`|OMTSqrSFaa	every one different .. wait till your period due .. if it doesn't come then do a test good luck x|`|l3lhcRDcaa	Well I had no symptoms at all except for a bit of added moodiness (which at the time I put down to being tired and stressed). I had no morning sickness, no headaches, no cramping, no bleeding, no sore boobs, basically nothing to indicate I was pregnant.<br>  <br>  I only realised something was up when I was prepared for AF and nothing happened. I even waited a few additional days just in case my calculations were off but lo and behold I was actually pregnant.<br>  <br>  Don't get discouraged by lack of symptoms. It could just be that you will be lucky and have an "easy" first trimester :)<br>  <br>  Good luck and baby dust...|`|KBgcptnhaa	first all women are diffrent and you may not get any other symtoms i didnt so dont worry to much the other thing i would say is dont think of it to much because did you no that a woman can acually trick her body in to thinking that she is pregnant even if she is not. so chill out and take care good luck x|`|0bSghnrtaa	Every woman is different.
MkKvGdxKaa	Q.1 Yes, ovarian cysts can affect fertilty, they produce a lot of hormones found in pregnancy, but obviously not hcg, which a hpt looks for.<br>  <br>  Q.2 Yes, you could still be pregnant. Hcg levels do not increase the same way in an ectopic pregnancy as in a normal pregnancy. When i had my ectopic i went between faint positives and negatives all the time. The doctor needs to do a Beta hcg reading from a blood test to detect hcg in an ectopic. they will rise and fall and that should be monitired as part of diagnosis.<br>  <br>  Q.3 Yes, you have a lot of symptoms of ectopic pregnancy.  My pain came and went, it wasnt constant, and that's how mine was missed. I didnt tick the correct symptom boxes. It was my blood levels gave it away. However, you havent had a positive hpt at all have you? Only a blood test will tell.<br>  <br>  Q.4 Consult your GP. you should be fine with paracetamal, but if you are in that much pain, you need to be re-seen.<br>  <br>  Q.5 No, an ectopic pregnancy will not show up in a scan unless it is being specifically searche for. even then it can be missed. Ectopic means ouside of the womb. When a scan is done when a woman is known to be pregnant and has these symptoms it is used to detect a faltering pregnancy inside the womb. It rules it out, it dosent detect it. If the pregnancy is located in a fallopian tube or beside the ovary it is very difficult to spot. Remember this isnt, never was and is never going to be a baby. It's a mass of cells and may present itself as a small bulge in the tube, or not be detectable at all. An ovarian cyst can be detected this way, but then they are very very common in early pregnancy anyway, as that particular ovary has all the work to do producing the hormones your body needs to maintain a healthy pregnancy.<br>  <br>  <br>  A healthy pregnancy at this stage will show up in the scan, but if your urine hcg level is reading as negative then it isnt likely to be seen. An egg sac can be seen anywhere between 4 and 5 weeks. It may just appear as a black circle in the womb lining, so they wont confirm pregnancy but can let you know pregnancy is likely.<br>  <br>  <br>  Q.6 No, folic acid would not be affecting you like this, it is naturally found in many many food stuffs..<br>  <br>  What you have described above, arriving at the hospital and then the pain subsiding happened to me. It was an ectopic pregnancy. It wasnt detected until 6 weeks and 3 days. Which is really far on, i'm a very very lucky girl. you need to get your bloods monitored, this is the best way to detect. In my opinion you need to get a second opinion or do something today. Ectopic pregnancy is a life threatening condition. If you think you have one you need checked out. Urgently. Have any beta hcg's been done?<br>  <br>  Edit: If you have had beta hcg done and it read negative this couldnt possibly be an ectopic. you will ALWAYS get a positive blood result. If you havent had one done, just ask.<br>  <br>  Edit: your friend at 12 weeks? Yeah, i guess so. no lab is infallable. they could have read her other bloods as increased progesterone etc but misread her hcg levels. They go into different blood vials and are seen by different technicians, the results are loaded at different times on to a computer and then can be read by the hospital. My hcg results were always back in about 2 hrs. Other hormones were a few days. Mistakes can happen. If she is 12 weeks she will be having her first scan etc and all must be well.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|O6DSFJbTaa	've heard that ovarian cysts can effect you fertility. Is this correct?*** Yes this is correct.  They can interfere with getting pregnant.<br>  <br>  The test at the doctors was negative but could I still be pregnant?**** Usually not!  If it was a blood test it is pretty right on the money<br>  <br>  If I am pregnant could it be ectopic? Is this why I'm in pain?*****Sounds like you are not pregnant even ectopic pregnancy would have a positive result.  But it would be painfull none the less<br>  <br>  I'm taking a lot of paracetamol should I cut down until I have a positive or negative pregnancy result? ********can't help you there sorry.<br>  <br>  Will the scan show up the pregnancy? They'll be looking for ovarian cysts not preganancy.******** If you were far enough along they would see it.  Just tell them your thoughts and they will prob.  look.|`|GOgVaXXKaa	Have you taken another preganncy test? If your period still hasn't come then there is a good chance you are! Especially as the dr did a test before your period was due and it wasn't performed with first morning urine. The pain, if they've ruled out appendicitis, could be ligament pain- I remember being ina  shop doubled up once when I was pregnant with my DD with pain- thought it was AF coming (although pain was very sharp and extremely painful) but turns out it was ligament pain. However if the pain is still bad and a pregnancy test comes up positive then please go back to A+E- esp if you have any spotting, or shoulder tip pain ( a classic ectopic symptom).<br>  <br>  Most cysts on ovaries are beign and harmless. Some may affect fertility but until you've ruled out pregnancy don't panic- do a test today (as you're a week late you won't need to use FMU- use a test such as First Response) and if it's still negative then take yourself to the GP.<br>  <br>  If your cycles are regular and you know you OVed then I think you're pregnant. However if you don't have regular cycles it is possible you OVed later than you thought this cycle. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!
RqeHygq1aa	I have Pcos... Im 5ft tall and weigh 175 pounds when I weighed less my periods we regular.Now that I have put on weigh my periods are irregular nd I dont ovulate.Im trying to loose weight ...<br>  <br>  if you loose 10-20 pounds it will improve your fertility|`|hORVMOHKaa	my sister has pcos and she tried to get pregnant for over 3 years. she started working out alot and eating healthy and she got pregnant without medication<br>  <br>  Good luck and Baby dust!
tSKBsbIyaa	As you said, you might have ovulated on or around 5th Mar. I guess you should wait until you skip your periods, that's till 18th, as you have ovulated late as per your cycle.<br>  I am facing the same problem of late ovulation, which lend me into the same stage of curiosity and anxiety.<br>  But don't worry, you should wait for at least 10 more days after 15th Mar. in case by time you do not get your periods.<br>  All the very best.<br>  Lot of baby dust on you.. ;)
Yba724Wkaa	It's a really tough time in your pregnancy but just remember your almost there! Talk to your doctor about how uncomfortable you are and maybe they could give you some ways to ease some of your discomfort. Try allowing time to simply relax with your feet up once the little one comes you will not be able to.<br>  <br>  I would suggest not using castor oil it usually takes awhile to kick in and even if it did work would you really want to be dealing with that while trying to deliver your baby?<br>  <br>  Best of luck your almost done. These are some of the toughest times yet.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	DO NOT TRY CASTOR OIL!!! It can cause your baby to have a bowel movement while inside you still which can cause infection. Keep on trying sex and walking. Nothing is guaranteed to work, baby will come when he's ready unfortunately.|`|T8ksKCWCaa	Don't use Castrol oil either, that is for your car's engine!
7oF2o4q5aa	I know what you mean!  First son, not a problem except when he was standing up on a swing set (at the top where the slide starts) and said, MOM!  Watch! Missed the slide and landed about four feet down on his side.  Scared me to death!  I was RIGHT THERE!  Second son...well, let's just say I used to call him NO-NO ...No, no! We don't stand on the open oven door to get to the butcher knives!  No, the oven was not on.  NO-NO we don't hit our brother with a frying pan because he teased us (he was 10 months old then)!  GEEZ-A-LOO but they move fast!|`|jrCZ6fadaa	NO, I watch my kids.... BOILING WATER?? WTF?<br>  <br>  FAith, I DON'T let my kids in the kitchen when i cook, so yeah I'd rather take care of them than let them burn themselves with boiling water. <br>  <br>  My dad was severely burned from head to toe as a child becaure his parents were no different the you two.|`|Q8wDjvZ1aa	my brother was the same way.   when he was 10 months old my grandpa who was watching us fell alseep, chase drank some lamp oil that was totally kept out of reach, but somehow he got it.   also before he was a year while my parents were out of the car trying to figure out where to back the camper into, my brother un buckled his car seat, crawled over to the front, and somehow put the car in gear with me in it.  my dad came to the rescue on that one.  he has burnt himself, on lawn tractor motors, gotten into more trouble than the average person, and so on and so forth. he has been on first name basis with ER nurses for years, if he can climb it, he can jump off it seemed to be his theory. he has spent more time in a cast or neck brace then he has out of one it seems, and yet he's still around to talk about it and he's 18. (although im not sure it ever stopped)   it had nothing to do with supervision or not, we had great parents. but some kids are just VERY accident prone,  just keep an extra eye on your kids, when they are like this because it only ever takes one major accident.|`|ca3b78825bebe64ebe18091da334ecc1aa	How many lives???<br>  <br>  Psst... Do you want to buy a cat from chernobyl that has eighteen half life's.<br>  <br>  Or better yet, take more care of your child who has only one life by making your home more children friendly.|`|NiO0qTEzaa	Hah, that sounds exactly like my lil' brother.<br>  <br>  He's managed to crack his head open twice when he was a little toddler and he fell out of the pram and rolled down a gravel driveway when he was just six months old.<br>  <br>  He's not accident prone now, maybe just a little klutzy. Your daughter will grow out of it with age and common-sense as she grows!|`|pnL5WTXMaa	kids have accidents that's for sure and you don't want to be overprotective. but you want to be a little more proactive sometimes. (21 month old probably shouldn't be on the top bunk, or be able to access boiling hot water). you got to be watching them a little closer...especially if she is accident prone.|`|mzFUWq8iaa	sounds like my sister when she was a baby. she threw herself of a bed, hit her head on wooden railing, and fell out of her high chair. my mom called her the 'head baby' since she always landed on her head. no damages or anything like that.|`|tsad330Maa	WOW KIDS WILL BE KIDS I MEAN YOU CANT *ALWAYS* BE THERE. DON'T FEEL BAD BOUT WHAT THOSE WOMEN SAY "I TAKE CARE OF MY CHILD."

THEY LIVE AND LEARN|`|77OFGXdLaa	To be honest lumps and bumps are normal all children fall and have minor accidents but jesus if shes falling off the couch does that not say to you dont put her on the couch and leave her on her own. <br>  As for boiling water i never let my daugther anywhere near the cooker or kettle you really have to be extra careful and a child that small shouldnt be on a bunk bed in the first place. <br>  My daughter is a bit accident prone but by that i mean she falls over her own feet alot but I minimise the risks of her coming to harm by insuring my house is child freindly and by watching her very closely. I know this may be hard if you have more than 1 child but if you sit down and write out all the potential hazards and risk and take steps to minimise these she should stop having so many accidents.|`|98qMZZPlaa	I wouldnt even have asked the question like you did.....<br>  Its a tough issue though, because yes, some babies need extra attention because of the trouble they can get into.  It's not even a matter of her growing out of so much as paying her more attention and making sure that she doesn't get seriously injured.  Some babies cannot be left alone for a second and a bunk bed.... ? Thats very dangerous, not to mention anything in the kitchen and bathrooms.<br>  Thanks God the angels look over babies, but we still need to be extra  safe and carefull with them.<br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Oh, and it is better Safe than Sorry, so it's really okay to waste the Drs time!|`|b8f0CfSsaa	Oh bless her! <br>  <br>  My daughter stood on her bounce and spin zebra once and before I could get across the room to grab her she went head first in to our glass TV stand (which luckily didn't break!). She loves to climb and is constantly falling, its just so difficult to watch children all the time (to the first answerer, is she supposed to strap her children to her chest when she craps or something?) that when a difficult one comes a long that is accident prone your constantly worrying!I have just invested in a million stair gates, I may aswell have shares in childrens safety products now because I have gone so nuts on the stuff.<br>  <br>  As for when they grow out of it...lord knows. I am hoping when she can understand what I say fully that I will be able to convey what is dangerous or not, fingers crossed.<br>  <br>  ETA: Get off your high horse. I am not a bad parent and you are in no position to judge seeing as you do not know me, you do not observe me at home and you have no comprehension as to how much attention I do pay to what my child is doing. She isn't allowed in the kitchen alone either and the worst she has had is the incident I described. Like most parents I cannot watch her all the time, so don't try and draw paralells between myself and your grandparents who blatantly did not watch their kids.|`|AkFag8tNaa	Some accidents are inevitable and some children are more accident prone than others but I would recommend (if this is how it happened) getting a baby gate for the kitchen and keeping cooking pans on the back burner (stove guard if you can as well).|`|pwu9xzF8aa	at the moment i do not have an accident prone child- but this can change any day lol<br>  my brother was massively accident prone- and he never did anything really out of the ordinary, just the same stuff as the other kids, but somehow managed to hurt himself all the time. He got his fist lot of stitches at 2, and had at least one lot every 6 months thereafter lol.  It drove my parents insane- they didnt want him to play because they were scared what he was going to do next. <br>  <br>  he grew out of it in his second year at school. i hope your little one does soon!! its a hard enough job being a worrying mother- but your job would be ten times harder and stressfull! some kids just find ways to hurt themselves doing the simplest things lol- just keep doin wat u r doin!

MeQHkPB1aa	They're beautiful!  I absolutely love the girl's name!!  I'd never heard the name Shi before.  I really like it. Very unique!|`|7i6qj4OXaa	I think it's quite cruel to call a boy Shi because he will be referred to as 'shy' LaKeith, which isn't very masculine.  I don't like LaKeith either but it's obviously your choice.  Double barrel surnames are a real pain and I know that because I have one.  No-one gets it first time and every time you make a phone call to an oganisation you have to spell it out.  My own children had to get my permission to drop part of the double barrelled bit in school because they couldn't stand it.  It's your life and your child.|`|QPTlQCiSaa	I know its hard to agree on the "perfect name" but....I think if you both agree then these names are great for you....Just remember sit in your house alone and call the name out like your calling him/her down the hall and see if you still like it, good luck|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I like those names.|`|dde71309ca21a9e33bc231d542f11a70aa	I really like those names - I also like Shi for a girl too!|`|KHXO5LPpaa	i love LaKeith and isabella :-)<br>  <br>  <br>  also i have a double barrel sir name (pain!)<br>  <br>  I'm Lucia Magdalena Rodriguez-Moreno   essay off a name! llol|`|140581050ff8e4e1837ed61c01214957aa	I like it =) <br>  <br>  I'm more a fan of Mia than I am of Amelia, but Amelia is OK.|`|UxG6CkU2aa	I think your names are great!!!

If you can't stand the flavor, take the concentrated cranberry pills.<br>  <br>  And since you're pregnant, see your doctor so you can be told to drink cranberry juice!  It's the lecture I've gotten every time I visited a doctor for a UTI  :)|`|H41u0B8Jaa	Don't take any medicine that isn't prescribed by your doctor.  Go to the doctor and make sure they know you are pregnant and see what you can take for your UTI.|`|CPwdVc4caa	I'm 17 weeks pregnant, and I've had UTIs constantly through the entire pregnancy.  Your OB can prescribe a safe antibiotic that won't have any negative effects on the baby; it's far worse for both of you to let it go untreated.

Xc02z608aa	I have loved my son since I decided to have a baby.  I knew that my baby would be wonderful and sweet.  He is nearly 10 months old now, but if I'd only gotten to hold him 3 times, I would have left this earth feeling grateful and fulfilled.  <br>  <br>  It is not your fault, things like this happen, but they are never anyones fault.|`|AA12221392	I am very sure your mom loved you very much. Mom's have a deep connection to thier unborn children, that is why when woman ended up losing them in a miscarriage they grief for the lost of thier child even though they never see it or held it. Your mom even got to hold you, and touch your little fingers and toes. <br>  <br>  I know that it must be hard to think that it wasn't your fault, but it wasn't your fault. sometimes freak things happen, and it is nobody's fault. <br>  Does your dad know that you are feeling like this? You may want to talk to him, or tlak with a school counsler, to help you stop feeling so much guilt. <br>  Good luck, and remember your mom did love you|`|sVdQSMvJaa	There is no doubt in my mind that your mother loved you.  You are a perfect gift from God made out of your father and your mother's love for one another.  And trust me SHE KNEW YOU.  She may have only held you for 2 days before she passed but she knew you from the moment she conceived you.  Ask any mom!<br>  <br>  BTW I have an 11 month old and I loved from before I even knew her.  I prayed for her for 5 years before she was even conceived.|`|26e007e4ed7e7d42044814b364794a0eaa	A mother loves her children before they are even conceived.  I would want the doctor to take my life and save my babies with every child if the situation came up.  I am sure your mother is looking down on you with as much love and admiration as a mother here on earth.  Don't let anyone tell you any different.|`|qEGl3J4jaa	I am myself a mother of two beautiful children. I can tell you that a mother loves her child from the day she knows there is a life inside her. She spends 24 hrs a day caring for that life and getting to know it by the way it moves and feels inside her. You can tell when your baby is sleeping, when they are awake and playing and you can just feel what kind of personality this little person will have when they are born. I am sure she spent everyday of the nine months you were inside her loving you. You should feel no guilt over the fact that she is no longer with you as you had absolutely no control over the situation and I am sure that everything that was possible was done for her. I hope that this can help you in even a small way.|`|N2AKuvVkaa	I have loved my son since before he was born. To most people, it is unconditional (like it is to me). Don't worry that it was your fault - sometimes these things happen, and it's not anyones fault. If i was your mother and that happened to me, i would have wanted it to be me rather than you that had to pass away, because i would have already had a chance to live. You, as a baby, wouldn't have.<br>  <br>  Kym J|`|AA10442890	Did your mother love you? absolutely. a mother is a mother from the moment she conceives. And you are NOT at fault for her death.<br>  You probably need to find someone in a similar situation and for a friendship. Friends with similar stories can often help each other more than anyone else can.<br>  Good luck, and I know your mom still loves you.|`|pwu9xzF8aa	i loved my daughter from the day i knew i was pregnant, and it is the same with the baby i am now pregnant with.  A mothers worrying and concern and care and love starts as soon as she knows there is something in there....usually lol|`|Iz5tNA5aaa	I have 4 children (11 to 4) and I've loved them all even before I was pregnant with them.  When my husband and I were trying to have a baby I fell in love with the child that would come and the second I found out I was pregnant that love just grew with my child.  Rest assured that your mother loved you for 9 months before you were born and the 2 days she was with you.  I'm sure she's in heaven looking down with love in her eyes at you. <br>  <br>  It wasn't your fault that your mother died from complications.  If given a choice, most mothers would rather give up their own lives than allow their child to die.  Before giving birth each time, I told my husband, doctor and nurses that if there is a choice between me or the baby, they were to save the baby.<br>  <br>  Please find someone to talk to about your guilt.  It will make you feel better to have someone to share your feelings with and someone to support you.<br>  <br>  Good luck and remember, your mother loved you and will always love you -- whether she is here on earth or not.

A friend of mine lost her dad in the second trimester and after she spoke to her midwife she was offered counselling etc. The baby was fine and she gave her hope to look to through the grieving process. <br>  <br>  Speaking to her midwife as soon as she can will be vital as they can arrange counselling etc and guide her through the bereavement process.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the baby :).|`|HM0cxcahaa	Hi Craig,<br>  <br>  I am sorry for your families loss. It should not effect the baby at all, women get through wars pregnant and with loss. <br>  <br>  Just make sure she keeps up her fluids and eats regularly. See if there is anything you can do for her, take her out for some icecream, walk to get fresh air etc.|`|1xsUVtzBaa	Babies are at tough times strong little things..medically there is no harm in a good cry. Stress is generally not good for any ones health so if you can ease any of her emotion please do so.

Tell her to be strong for your baby..and that having a family is so so important to you both.<br>  So sorry for both of you in this time :(|`|sMUw3bJCaa	It may effect the baby, sadness and stress CAN lead to miscarriage but i really hope for both of you that everything will be fine.

OxFV92hJaa	Prior to 1 year is not recommended. That 1st year. First smile, first roll, first word, first pull up, first step, first EVERYTHING is something you will want to be there for.<br>  <br>  With classes being part time on (I'm assuming) a 4 yr degree....you're better of to wait till the baby is a yr old. Even if you got a degree today, you wouldn't land a job....economy wouldn't allow that. <br>  <br>  I'd enjoy the firsts with the baby, then at 6 months start thinkin/making plans and signing up. Prior to 1 year is critical in development and bond. Whether people like it or not.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	six weeks is the earliest they can go to daycare|`|UcNdp3TSaa	Don't listen to the person who said "prior to one year is not recommended"....i work in childcare and we accept babies from 6 weeks. It is very hard for the parent (not trying to discourage you, just being honest) but as your bub will be so young, you and they, will form a beautiful bond with the carers at the daycare as they will spend a lot of 1 on 1 time with him/her. I think it's good for babies to spend time in care from a young age (not necessarily 6 weeks, but before they turn 1 at least) as by the time they reach the seperation anxiety stage, they are already used to the routine of going to care. Also, it helps their social skills develop. My son is 14 months and been in care 1 day a week since he was 7 months. He loves it, there are new, exciting toys there, he can play trucks with the "big boys" and he loves being cuddled and spoilt by his carers. <br>  <br>  I say go for it!|`|iMaTMWMxaa	I think they normally take them from 6 weeks. I don't think it's too young :) Sounds like it will be really good for you.<br>  <br>  I am doing a course at the moment, and I'm lucky as it's a Saturday and their dad looks after them. I can tell you it is the key to my ongoing sanity!!<br>  <br>  Go for it :)|`|E5CnUdhsaa	2 days really wont do any harm:) my daughter was in 5 days a week from 6 months and shes happier than ever. the transition was bad but i believe if she had gone earlier it would of just been a normal part of routuine for her...your baby will adapt:)|`|I7ktUFQfaa	I've never heard of any daycares taking children that are that young. I think most daycares only takes kids when they're 6months+ old. At the daycare by my house kids have to be 12 months.|`|VCCKfT3taa	I looked into daycare myself for a baby that young and I couldn't find anyone who would take an infant under 3 months at the least. <br>  Of course if you do find someone, more power to you. <br>  <br>  If it's only a few hours for two days a week, then it shouldn't make that much of a difference. The reason they say you shouldn't put a child that young in daycare is because the first 6 months are such a bonding time and leaving the baby with a caregiver more often than not will interfere with that bond. <br>  <br>  But if it's only for a few hours a week, I think it's okay IMO.|`|OfDVU1FYaa	My baby went to daycare at six weeks and her brother was a year old he cried for the first couple of weeks, but my six week old did better at the daycare then she did at home she mellowed down alot. I do miss them both alot but their father and I have to pay the bills. Waiting until after a child turns one to put them in daycare will cause them to have a lot of separation anxiety and it will make you feel so bad, well I did for waiting so long to put him in daycare. It tears you up to see a child cry when they are in new surroundings without their parents.|`|mldo1vxYaa	You will need to check if day care will take a baby so young as some of them dont take babies until they are 4 months old. If you are worried about leaving the baby, every mother doesnt want to leave their children while they go to work etc but it has to be done, and 2 days a week will be fine, I wouldnt worry.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	6 weeks is the earliest that a baby can go in, but I think at that age you will miss her terribly. As one lady mentioned the first year is critical to development.

OxFsslN8aa	Being the better person and acting like a mature adult is always the best policy.  When your daughter has been accused of something take her aside and speak to her about it.  If you believe that she has been wrongly accused then tell her so and make sure she knows that you believe her.  She can then hold her head high with the knowledge that her mother behaves better than the neighbor & she has someone to go to who trusts her.  Be an example for your  daughter.|`|okh3hL8taa	How can you call this woman your friend when you dislike her so much?  I suggest you stay away from her and you keep your daughter away from her daughter.  As far as what she has told her daughter and how she chooses to raise her daughter, that's not up  to you to judge.  If you don't want to tell your child not to play with this other child then you are just going to have to learn to be tolerant of the child and her mother both.|`|koVk3P9Gaa	I'm sorry, but if some woman got into MY daughter's face, yelling and cursing over something like that, it would be "Go time"  You need to cut ALL ties w/ this maniac and her brat of a daughter.

Sit this woman down and explain to her what's going on and that you will not tolerate it any longer. She needs to do something about her child before you seek 3rd party intervention in the form of the juvenile justice system.
1xsUVtzBaa	Here's some info i found-<br>  During pregnancy, your cervix secretes mucous which forms a thick mucous plug. This plug forms on the cervix and it’s purpose is to prevent any bacteria getting into the uterus – like an added layer of protection for your baby.<br>  <br>  The mucous plug (medical term is operculum, i.e. plug in opening) is usually is cloudy or clear in colour, thick and sticky – some women describe it looking like a glob of semen or ‘snot’ or a mix of both! When your cervix begins to thin and dilate at the end of your pregnancy, there may be some slight blood loss due to small capilaries breaking from the movement. The blood then gets caught up in the mucous and this is why it’s also called ‘a bloody show’ as the mucous becomes blood stained.<br>  <br>  During the last couple of weeks of pregnancy or up until labour itself, the plug will start to come away so the baby can pass through the cervix. Some women do not even notice their plug expelling as there is already an increase in normal cervical mucous due to hormones. The mucous plug often comes away like a continuous stringy discharge – sometimes it can actually resemble a plug. Some women do not see their mucous plug until well into labour – I was 5 centimetres dilated and it wasn’t until my waters had broken before I saw it!<br>  <br>  According to a poll in the BellyBelly Forums, at the time of writing this article, 34% of women reported that they had lost their show around 2 days prior to labour starting, with a further 30% who lost the show during labour and 17.65% who never saw their show at all! The remaining percent lost their show 1-2 weeks before labour started. So if your show makes an appearance, you can be assured things will be on their way very soon, but be careful not to get too excited and tell everyone a€“ you just might find the super frequent phone calls and unexpected visits a little overwhelming!<br>  <br>  Some Quick Facts From BellyBelly’s Midwife, Brenda Manning:<br>  <br>  <br>  Having your show, or mucous plug:<br>  <br>  Doesn’t mean labour is imminent <br>  Is common after the caregiver has done a vaginal exam, especially if s/he has done a strip & stretch (or stretch & sweep) <br>  Is common post love-making <br>  Can be brown – it’s just old blood <br>  Is a positive, encouraging sign that the birth is near during advanced labour because ‘a good heavy show’ usually means that the cervix is fully dilated. <br>  The only time we are interested in it is when it’s confused with bleeding and women phone us (quite rightly) very concerned that they’ve had a bleed but on questioning it’s just blood-stained mucous (common after love-making).<br>  <br>  If in doubt save it, bring it in on a pad and show your caregiver – s/he won’t mind, we see/smell/feel all sorts of stuff and are completely unaffected by it – truly!!!<br>  <br>  Midwives do tend to get excited if a woman arrives in labour with a good heavy show because it means that things are happening and they can reassure you of that without having to do a vaginal exam.<br>  <br>  Remember that you should always report any vaginal discharge or bleeding in pregnancy to your midwife or doctor for evaluation.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	Out of my 4 previous pregnancies i have only had "The Show" once with my 4th pregnancy. I lost a part of the plug which looked like stringy snot (sorry tmi) it had a tiny amount of blood in it but it was more like a streak inside the plug. Then 2 days later i lost more but it was more of a blob shape and was a light brown/ yellowy color with a little bit of red through it. I went into labour 2 days later. You will know it if it happens. Good luck|`|b8f0CfSsaa	It isn't always blood. Mine was just (and sorry if TMI) a big blob of what looked like snot. A lot of women have blood in it though, which is usually embedded in the mucus. <br>  <br>  As for it being called the show...I'm not sure so I am glad you asked this!|`|png0sxZnaa	Most of the time its like a mucus plug is just like a big blob of discharge which is often but not always blood streaked!<br>  <br>  Its called the show because it is a sure sign that your cervix is ripening and begining to open in preparation for the birth of your baby!|`|HM0cxcahaa	Im preg with my second. I lost mine a few weeks ago it was not bloody it was more like jelly (like jelly fish blubber TMI) still no labour for me.<br>  <br>  I think its the "Show" because it shows you your cervix is effacing, but it can regenerate again.

The screaming is what you should worry about first.  He might be having bad dreams.  Investigate that, and you might find out there is a source of psychological disturbance.  Help him with that, and other things like porn and masturbation might go away almost by themselves, because your son will be less stressed.|`|XnGCW0k0aa	does he have genitals ? if so the yes this is possible. but at 8 i think its a bit weird seeing as he hasn't even strated puberty unless he started early or something i don't know when you hear him screaming run into the room and turn the light on if he was then shoot him|`|zEabsLYDaa	u shld in the first place nt allow pornographic materials in  house, kids are a gift fr God. pls b a good parent. this goes to show how u have bn handling ur kid. try to raise in well so he can give you peace later in life|`|tSLjRwQnaa	Probably and good for him.|`|FNVbetnqaa	he's 8.

fO1ZzPXyaa	Your baby's lying on a nerve. Unfortunately, unless the baby moves the right way, it won't go away. This lasted my entire pregnancy. All you can really do is tylenol. Warm baths (not hot) help to take a little pressure off. Also, if you could afford a maternity massage, that's completely safe and may offer some relief. Good luck.|`|CPwdVc4caa	Actually, there's absolutely no reason NOT to see a chiropractor; most are trained to work with pregnant women, and know exactly how to adjust things without hurting baby.

My hips are naturally out of balance, and so the extra stress of carrying a baby aggravated it to the point where it was causing constant back pain and sciatica; a few sessions with a chiropractor, and I can move again ;)<br>  <br>  You might also try yoga to stretch everything out and loosen some of the tension in your muscles that's causing the shooting pains; there are a lot of yoga poses designed to stretch your back out and strengthen your hips, which will help out with delivery as well.|`|4kX61Y97aa	hi i posted similar question earlier you may want to look at the feedback<br>  <br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjQvwIl9WiBhRTlNWAWkozAgBgx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090310035745AA8dKkg">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  ive been a suffer since birth with back problems after so many tests they said my muscles were weak since being pregnant back pain as become worse because it weakens in the back im due to have phsyio next week for back problems but as long as the scan showed baby is healthy it wouldn't be problem. on scan they said my baby as got a good back lol|`|C4ibOR7Laa	YES!!! does your leg start to really hurt then go numb? i got it really bad yesterday after pushing my nephew around all day i could hardly sit down, its a trapped nerve, my doctor said itssciaticaa and swimming will help (but it doesnt)<br>  iv been getting it on and off since iwas about 5weeks and im now 17weeks3days
CPwdVc4caa	It's safe for the baby (or at least, there's absolutely no research to indicate otherwise), but it may not turn out the way you expect it to.  The change in your hormones makes your hair do funky stuff during pregnancy; for instance, my hair turns red when I try to dye it brown.<br>  <br>  BTW, how many times do you plan on asking the same question before you'll finally believe the answers you've been given?  You've already gotten input from a stylist who knows exactly what she's talking about...|`|1hciyvKdaa	Heres the deal, you have had all these women as well as other askers of this same question it all boils down to this. Just because a baby is born appearing normal, alot of issues show up as the child grows, and by then, when a child is developmentally slow, has autism or hundredsd of other problems, noone looks back to see common denominators such as chemicals used for hair enhancement. The more scientists study the effects of things on women who are pregnant and follow their children for the next 10 years, the more they find out.  So all these women who say its safe, it would be interesting to hear how old their children are, and if there are any developmental problems with their children. I myself bleached my hair during each pregnancy, back then, noone questioned such things as dangerous. My oldest gets server hives, starting at age 6 or so, my son at age 12 started getting life threatening food allergies, and my youngest at around age 6 started showing signs of ADHD. Did any of this come from the chemicals, I ll never know, but if I had to do it all again, at this time with the data and the knowledge readily available that unnecessary chemical exposure should be put off, Id never dye my hair during pregnancy. Self elected chemical exposure to me, from how my kids are, is just not worth the problems that might happen. Chemicals do absorb into our skin. That is why testing is done on animals, and pregnant animals to see if there is danger for humans. Now that people do not agree with animal testing, the testing now is done on ourselves, and to me its not worth the risk of saddling a child with a deformity or mental problem over a cosmetic desire. Just my two cents.|`|OfDVU1FYaa	I relaxed my hair throughout both my pregnancy and both my children are fine|`|436fREgIaa	any chemicals on the body are not allowed until the 2nd trimester.
pzLDXL6gaa	This depends on each STI. You should google it. Some (like herpes and HIV) can be passed to the baby either when she's pregnant or during childbirth, however if she takes the correct medicines to prevent this, it's unlikely to happen. You might get more answers in the STD section.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|vTkbAOSLaa	Whatever you have it will appear in the child. Some STDs can cause a child to be miscarried or it will just have whatever you do|`|AA11634257	yes
qYDcqa0Laa	It's far too soon for implantation bleeding - that occurs 8 to 10 days after conception. At this stage a home test will not pick up a pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Possibly just a mid-cycle bleed, nothing to worry about. Monitor it and if it continues see your doctor.|`|T5nZjBWfaa	it could be a couple of things. it could be implantation bleeding. so in that case, wait for your period and test.. or it could be old built up period blood. you can spot this or get this anytime before or after your period. its nothing to worry about. period blood can be really light red and then again it can be brown and really dark. i went through this a couple times and it freaked me out too lol..|`|2V42MnYraa	If I had to guess I would say you have irritated your cervix a little from all the sex, nothing to worry about.  Good Luck to you.|`|5oCikIfMaa	It could be old blood or maybe discharge if your worried you should ask your doctor

lJ5Ao2aIaa	Keep your baby clean and dry by changing his diaper frequently. That may mean getting him up at night for a diaper change.<br>  <br>  Rinse his diaper area well at each diaper change. Some parents keep cotton balls and a squirt bottle or an insulated container of warm water at the changing table for easy, gentle cleanups. Pat your baby's skin dry — don't rub!<br>  <br>  Put your baby's diaper on loosely or use a diaper that's a little big on him to allow for better air circulation. If your baby wears cloth diapers, don't use plastic pants. If you buy disposables, try a different brand to see if that helps.<br>  <br>  When the weather is warm and your baby can play outside or in a room with an easy-clean floor, leave his diaper (and ointment) off for as long as possible every day. Exposure to the air will speed healing.<br>  <br>  Consider letting your baby sleep with a bare butt whenever he has a rash. A plastic sheet under the cloth sheet will help protect the mattress.|`|Y9mew1mwaa	Has your doctor considered a bacterial yeast infection? I had the same problem with my son and after many doctor visits they finally prescribed an antifungal medication. This helped clear it up but dried out his skin really bad. Also i find that a cortizone cream helps keep them comfortable and clears things up a little faster. But you should only use a few times a day.|`|YrjkOttiaa	Sounds weird but trust me it works.  Get a cup of flour (the normal kind you bake with), put it in a saucepan, heat it on the hob until it turns brown (make sure you stir it all the time), wait until it cools and then dab it on the nappy rash using cotton wool.  Do this every time you change her nappy.  The rash will be gone in a few days.<br>  <br>  A cup full will last you ages.|`|7z6BWoESaa	Ok this same thing happened to my daughter and this is what the Doc told me to do, sounds strange but it worked like a charm, brown some flour in a dry non stick pan, you can do a large amount as after you brown it you let it cool all the way off and can keep it in a tupperwre container, just wash with warm water let the baby bottom dry and then put on the browned flour make sure it is cooled off! cleared her up in about a week! whenever it returned we did the same thing works like a charm!|`|YxFDiEaCaa	Take her to the doctors or the health visitor and tell them about all the creams that you have used and show them the rash, my baby seems to have the same rash but on his face.|`|2VxP6Cdkaa	keep out of Nappy's and give plenty of water to dilute the urine to help stop burning feeling|`|HJnpx7KGaa	try medicated talcum powder & change the nappy as soon as it is soiled|`|8NcuUEKkaa	if your child is sensitive to sudocrem, then it is highly likely they are sensitive to a lot of the creams, they could also be sensitive to some foods which will also cause the nappy racsh to flare (my son has various allergies i had similar problems his was due to his food allergies and yes it came out in his nappy area the sensitivity to creams made matters worse), the best solution i found was to take the nappy off and leave fresh to the air, i know you cant do this all the time, but when ever your home just strip her down, when she goes to sleep pop a white fresh towel under her to save her mattress but still leave her exposed it doesnt matter if she has a blanket over her as long as there is no nappy on , it should clear a little, it wont get worse, when cleaning the area use cotton wool and tepid water not wipes (they can irritate too),its not nice to put anything on an open rash as it stings to hell, but try and buy some cream called 50/50 its 50 percent liquid parrafin and 50percent petroleum jelly no color no perfume no additives, its a softer form of vaseline easy to apply but dont use it all the time as its goood to get the air round the rash but i would use it before bed and before putting a nappy on also if your out and about you can use it on the cotton wool to wipe her bottom when she has messed save you fussing to get the right temp on the water dont revert to wipes until all irritation has gone, if you still get problems (nappy rash can even be a side effect of teething) try slowly changing her diet starting with dairy products as these are the most likely irritant in babies|`|n6XYYyoLaa	she needs to see the doc, it could be infected, a yeast rash, or something other than simple diaper rash...do it for her comfort if nothing else...<br>  always make sure that the area is completely dry before putting any cream on...<br>  use washclothes instead of wipes for now<br>  use a thin coat of cream not thick....<br>  u can use adult incontinence pads to protect things when giving 'air time' with no diaper...|`|AA10976444	My son got the bleeding kind of diaper rash when he was teething.  MY Dr gave me a 1% hydrosortisone cream and it worked like a charm.  I also gave him a baking soda bath as well to take the itch out of it.|`|xy0W50Lqaa	Oh dear, sounds like she has very sensitive skin like my daughter. <br>  My LO can be clear from nappy rash one minute then back it comes again.  I swear by Metanium, even if the skin is bleeding a little just persevere and keep putting the Metanium on, it should help her.  This happened to my girl and it took days to clear up instead of overnight like usual.  Teething contributes to the nappy rash.   Try and leave the nappy off for as long as you can.<br>  I read about Zinc & Caster oil but haven't tried that yet.|`|K3FuGAdOaa	Bag Balm. I know this may sound funny but it was originally used for cow utters from getting chapped and bleeding (my grandfather was a farmer).

I'd be shocked if I walked in and found him sat in his cot and he's been sitting without support for 2 months now (just can't get there himself)!  What a clever boy!<br>  <br>  My "surprise" was a couple of weeks ago, the day after he'd learned to roll back to front.  I left Lukas laying on his playmat whilst I ran upstairs to quickly get changed.  When I came back a couple of mins late he was gone!  Then I heard him cackle... he'd rolled across the room (I had no idea he could go that far), grabbed the lid from his toy box and was holding it over himself!  He giggled like crazy when I lifted the lid away as though he'd planned the whole thing.  <br>  <br>  He also randomly started saying "zoing zoing zoing" the other day and hasn't stopped since.

Last night, about 1am she projectile vomited ALL over me - it went in my hair, mouth, bra, all over my bed etc. - and the little moo sat there laughing lol :) she's 7 weeks old.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	my son is 23 months today and just started wearing underwear yesterday he'll have maybe 2 accidents but it's a start:) exciting for both of us. ii'm proud of him:) it's so nice too that we've been only using like one or two diapers a day|`|rFtKFp03aa	one of my babes started crawling yesterday.. <br>  <br>  I am so not ready for mobile babies lol :) <br>  <br>  I love it when mine are sitting in their cribs and smiling at me too when I go get them.. priceless|`|cv0foxlTaa	Yep, my little one took 4 steps today!  I couldn't believe it!  He is 12 months old.|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	My 10 month old took 3 steps today!|`|UFqacgoiaa	Ana is going through a "shy" stage. When we go to the skating, she is shy with all coaches but her favorite and private coach, Vicka. Yesterday I left her with a friend of mine while I did grocery shopping. When I came back she was on the ice with two girls in more advanced levels and when I told her it was time to go she puts on a bossy tone and says, "Mama, go away. I am playing with my friends." <br>  <br>  She is also getting used to the fact that she will have a little sister. When I take her to the store instead of pointing at things that she wants she points at building blocks, stuffed animals, and baby toys and says rather excite, "Mama! For baby!"|`|VJnmHFR0aa	Mine turned a year a couple of weeks ago, she got some building blocks for her birthday, I know she's not supposed to have them, but they're massive blocks so I let her get on with it.  She surprised me by being able to take two blocks apart and then putting them back together.  Didn't expect her to do that for a while.|`|KRQtXHwIaa	My youngest is 20 months and she used to just yell "mama" when she woke up. But lately she yells, "momma, I wake up girl!" Too cute. She got it from me cause whenever I go into get them from their naps I always ask them if they are ready to be "wake up girls" :)|`|yCwPxulYaa	My daughter was playing in her jumper on Saturday and she started getting restless and screaming "dadadadadadada".  Her daddy was very excited!  Mommy on the other hand was like noooooo say mamamamama!!!  Now she is saying dada to everything!|`|TJusfEnlaa	My 10 month old shockd me yesterday when I said to him "Aren't you a clever boy" cos he has just started drinking his bottle on his own and he looked at me with a massive grin and started clapping his hands!!|`|CoSdW7xQaa	well idk if it's considered something new or whatever,<br>  but just yesterday my babyboy started putting his little toe in his mouth.<br>  not anything special i just think it's adorable!
bVkIEpyGaa	Your body starts producing hcg once implantation has taken place (which can take up to 16 days from fertilisation) and the hcg levels should double every 2 to 3 days after implantation. The brown tinge could sure be a sign of implantation and if this is the case, then your hcg levels could still be quite low. The best you can do is test an overnight sample in a couple of days, as it will be more concentrated (as hard as it may be to wait). When I was pregnant the first thing I noticed was an increase in boob size, little bumps on my nipples and veins running through my breasts. I also had period type pains up until about 5 weeks. <br>  <br>  Fingers crossed for you|`|MHg9JhEKaa	When your period is due. There may be hcg present before then but too little to detect. <br>  <br>  I understand you are desperate to find out, but AF is only due today hun, please give it some more time, and if it's still not turned up and you still get negatives see the docs for a blood test. <br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope you get your BFP x|`|fYMWDQLGaa	i would suggest you to wait for another 2-3 days. dont get stressed if ur HCG levels didnt show up, cos many women dont get HCG levels high. you could wait upto 10 days and then take test. or taking blood test would help and show the results accurate than any tests would.<br>  <br>  goodluck and baby dust.... :)<br>  <br>  hope this is ur month..|`|6TQFahm4aa	i took a test at 13 days po and nothing, but on day 14 i took a test and it was positive. ( that was the say i was suppose to start but didn't) . If you really feel preggo take another test tomorrow or wait a few days to be sure.
hKJIDdVqaa	My kids are usually in school. If not then they are playing in their indoor basketball court, doing homework, etc.  My husband is at work. Normally I am not on the computer when my family is here so no they do not think I over use the computer.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	During the day, when I'm at work, the kids are at school & my partner is sleeping (he works 3rd shift).  <br>  <br>  In the evening, like right now, when I'm on the computer, my kids are either right next to me (like now - working on his homework & needing me to keep him on task) or playing with the puppies or playing in their room.  Sometimes they're out in the yard or doing something with dad or playing a video game.  <br>  <br>  My partner is a grownup & does things on his own.  Right now, he's changing the laundry. <br>  <br>  Yes, sometimes I think that I spend too much time on the computer, but everyone needs a hobby...|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	I don't think so, but I know there are plenty of people on here that spend way way way too much time on the computer. As for me usually when I am on here I am on my phone during a break at work, sitting on the couch next to my daughter, she is taking a nap, or when my husband has taken her to his mom's and I didn't go like right now.|`|zQWNb6neaa	Huh. I don't know where my older two are. Now that I think about it they have been gone for a while. Oh well, they best be out finding a job! The baby is breastfeeding, although I am kicking the lazy stinker off soon so she can show some self proficiency too. My partner is out providing for my lazy behind and best be bringin momma home some steak tonight. Too much time on the computer...nah. We be just fine, thanks.<br>  <br>  ~ If this is genuine, and not attacking us for being on here- my children are otherwise occupied, either at school, or looking at books, playing, painting, watching their allotted time of cartoons per day, etc. when I am one here and my husband is at work. Admittedly, I am probably on here more during the weekdays than I need to be :).|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	My daughter is currently on my lap watching the chair lol. Normally when I am on here, she's either asleep, i'm nursing her or i've got a bit of mummy time. Yes I probably do spend too mucb time on the PC, but I don't have many friends near me because they've all gone to uni so I chat to other mums from here.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	When the kids are at school or like now. Ones at work the others at dance.|`|SrcoG7JRaa	My youngest is asleep propped up against my knees, and my two oldest are playing tag with a horse, LOL. I'm watching them and on here doing miscellaneous stuff. Usually when I'm here they're otherwise occupied. <br>  Nah, I don't think I use the computer much at all compared to the avg. person. I'm only on here while I'm multitasking with work-related computer stuff, and when I don't have anything better to do (husband at work, kids asleep, dogs too sleepy to play midnight fetch).|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	Sometimes my children are outside, sometimes they are in bed, sometimes they are in the den (where the computer is).  It depends on what time of day it is.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes my husband is at work, sometimes he is in bed.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, I DO spend too much time on the computer.  Overall, though, no I do not think I spend too much time online.  As long as my house is clean and my children are not being neglected it is acceptable.  My family always comes first!|`|MVgm17o3aa	my 3 yr old son is playing when i am on the computer or napping and my daughter who is 11 is either at school or over her friends..My partner is a workaholic so he is always at work..I see him 2 hours a day max(sad, huh?) and I do not think i spend too much time on the computer, this is my fun time..I am a stay at home mother and this is my pleasure!|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	Right now my little girl is in front of me dancing to music videos. My son is reading books to him self. My husband is sadly still at work her gets home at 7. He will be home in about a half hour. I don't think i spend to much time on the computer. I go on after i do a lot of laundry and vacuum after they go to bed. Im on now because they are on in their own little world!|`|6Z4fKZ8aaa	Don't have kids, but my husband says we won't have Internet in his house when we go back to his country.  It causes too much distractions. The only reason we use it is because both of us are in school and we need the internet. He has some online classes, and I'm enrolled full-time in an online college.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	one is sleeping -16<br>  one is touring the west coast with his band-26<br>  one is in college -21<br>  one is on the porch talking to her friends -15<br>  one is behind me finishing her spellling-9<br>  and preparing for me to test her<br>  one is riding her horse in the field-10|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I think I spend way too much time on the computer. It consumes me. My son is playing in his room or watching a toonie next to me. He's pretty good at occupying himself. I have a laptop so I can use it wherever. I'm not stuck in a computer room.|`|AA10943329	My kids are usually busy doing their own thing, I don't have a partner and Yes, I spend too much time on here lol|`|nfzQkvqraa	Sure sometimes.  There are certainly other things I could do with my time.  When it gets warmer here I'll be on a lot less.  <br>  <br>  Currently my husband is downstairs throwing darts with a friend and my kids are playing with their stuffed animals under the dining room table.<br>  <br>  The scenario varies, but I don't ever feel like I'm taking away from family time to be on this site.  (which by the way is the only one I frequent)|`|KRQtXHwIaa	Right now at this exact moment, my kids are home. It is spring break this week so we are relaxing. All the kids except my youngest are watching a movie with their dad, and the youngest is roaming around the room "loving her baby" in her own little world. Movie is a big treat for my kids since we don't have cable or satellite.  So I am relishing the quiet for the moment and enjoying my cup of coffee, until I have to go make dinner.|`|JtbeH1Mgaa	I usually don't get on the computer until my kids are taking a nap or in bed for the night and my husband is at work unless I'm using it for important research.  I will also get on here when they are busy playing or he's watching movies... he loves watching scary movies lol.|`|5rdiZvYEaa	Sleeping, at a friends house,playing with daddy, or in their rooms for "quiet time".<br>  As of right now..My 6 year old,Tyler is in the bath-tub washing up, then i am making him a smoothie before he goes off to bed. We just put my 2 year old Ryan down to bed. My husband is off to bed too, only at 8:04PM. He woke up not feeling too good, so he rested the whole day. Well, Tyler's out of the bathtub now! Time to go make that smoothie!.<br>  <br>  I'm not always on here every day, unless the kids are busy themselves.|`|DvWGTzLUaa	My daughter is having a nap or is down to sleep for the night. As its 10:36pm, shes in bed for the night. Dont have a partner. No I dont spend too long on the computer. I do my shopping and banking and keep contact with people via the internet.|`|lwccQoEZaa	Kids are all grown up and on their on and the hubs is out in the field as he has been after his 9 to 5 for 30 yrs .. this is why I'm on the computer. Maybe He needs to ask that question.... 30 years is a long time.|`|ZFV16jy6aa	When I am on the computer the baby is napping. Don't like to be on too much when she is awake cuz she gets into mischief. But if I am on when she is awake then I stop really often to play with her or just give her some attention while she plays with her toys.|`|bc50adcd7a4cda84a5f4451579fa7554aa	my oldest is upstairs in her room, my youngest is outside playing, my husband is sitting to my right watching glenn beck and yes i do think i sometimes spend too much time on the computer. today is not that day.|`|DoaMYpfMaa	well i have one kid and he is next to me but if i am on the computer he is usually asleep or in front of me watching tv<br>  my husband is at work|`|rFwGnZIJaa	Mine is in my lap nursing. I usually only on the computer when baby is nursing or in bed for the night. Hubby is either working or hogging the TV.|`|TQ47vny4aa	My children are either reading a book or doing home work when I am on the computer. I try not to be on it once the home work is done.|`|uj1A73ZGaa	My girls are sleeping 90% of the time I am on the computer.Or they are at my parents house or at my in-laws house.  My husband is in Iraq currently.|`|rt2V9gLUaa	My son is still in NICU.  When he gets to come home I'll probably never let him out of my sight!  As of now my wife is napping on the couch.
F2cVt5jaaa	Not overused at all!!<br>  My middle name is Jane. <br>  I love it :o)<br>  <br>  I think it's used way more as a middle name, and i still think its not used that much. <br>  So as a first name I bet you will rarely find another girl named that :o)<br>  <br>  My name is Katelyn Jane by the way!|`|DHwPgw9iaa	I don't know any Janes. I think it's beautiful!|`|mfRH2Wiiaa	i don't think the name Jane is overused and if you were considering consider Jane Emily.|`|zbjaBgyEaa	I know - people think Jane is SO common but in reality it's not nearly as popular as they think.  It's much less common than a lot of names they think are 'unpopular' like Ava, Madison, Sophia, Lily, Layla, etc.<br>  <br>  They just think it's popular because, like, 50 years ago it really was.  Now the popularity has died down but lots of people still remember when schools were FILLED with Janes.  That and sayings like Plain Jane and stuff make people think the names more popular than it is.<br>  <br>  I LOVE the name Jane.  I think it's beautiful and simple and sweet.<br>  <br>  I only know two girls named Jane (they're both 21) both of whom, ironically, were roommates of my sister.  One spelt it Jayne.  Which I wasn't a massive fan of.<br>  <br>  It's actually in the 400s according to the SSA.  So you can inform them that it's actually not nearly as overused as they think it is.|`|A1PLJKhUaa	No, absolutely not! It's a beautiful name, and I rarely ever meet people called Jane. Go for it!<br>  <br>  The only one person I know called Jane is my Aunt's young daughter. Her father's name is Austen, so they called the baby Jane Austen as a first and middle name. I thought it was adorable =) <br>  <br>  It's simple, classy and gorgeous, and much better than Jayden and Tyler and God only knows what else people are naming their daughters nowadays.|`|xpUyH0psaa	i never actually met anyone named jane before. i think jane macheline is pretty.|`|cErLq7f3aa	i only know one jane personally. but i don't really think it's cute.  it's kind of plain and basic.|`|E6CShQfKaa	I think common names are fine to give a child if the middle name is unique. (which you have!) Personally, I don't know too many Janes but people do say it is overused. Good luck!|`|Mv5ixsJIaa	Nope, very pretty and understated, Jane Marcheline is very pretty.|`|wIwRsiNbaa	no i don't think it is overused because i don't know many people with that name|`|gu1sEQN8aa	No not really. I dont know too many Janes at all its pretty.|`|zwJaIDFeaa	no. but i don't like the name jane no offense

K7H1zrCbaa	Barbie.  at least their giant knockers are covered.  those brats dolls are dressed up like little prositutes|`|vGxipYJnaa	Barbie. Our daughter loves Barbie - and so did I! I buy her the tasteful ones; there are a few barbies who are a little too underdressed in my opinion. <br>  <br>  I don't like Bratz. The seem ditzy and trashy.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Barbie<br>  Happy Birthday to Barbie. She is 50 today|`|Iz5tNA5aaa	My 6 yr old loves Barbie and Bratz, though she does have a preference for Barbie!  I also love Barbie more.|`|5b5e3b4f114d52c05fdb151a2f5b2317aa	If my daughter wanted a Barbie or a brats doll, I would buy her one, but I would never force it on her.<br>  I was a tomboy my whole childhood (and still now) and didn't play with dolls, and that was forced on me. There were times where I wanted them, and couldn't have them, and I can see that going both ways. So, let your kid choose.|`|HztriBPAaa	I took my niece into Toys R Us and I saw those Bratz dolls and I nearly lost it. I think they are horrible. I played with Barbie as a kid but the feminist in me cringes a little looking at them. If I had to choose I would go with Barbie.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	i think bratz should be banned...eew there blinking awful! barbie and her perfect waist blah blah<<jealous much lol! honestly i wouldnt buy either but if she desperately wanted a barbie yeah id get her one but id knit it a cardi lol:)|`|gKN8YNCkaa	yes but i perfur barbie bratz are sending the message to dress inappropriate at a young age where barbie is grown in sense|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Everyone tells my daughter she looks like the Bratz dolls lol so we always get her that, she loves it.|`|MChOb9IKaa	My girls love Barbies, but they also have a few Bratz as well.|`|20117c2d24d216a72c5b973e9d412b2caa	I don't think so, thankfully I had boys.|`|AA11220327	my 5 year old like both but if she had to choose, she would pick barbie|`|hKJIDdVqaa	yeah if she would play with them. I would buy her Barbie, because she has a job. She won't play with them though. I have bought them for her in  the past, she does not care. she is a tomboy.  I loved barbie though.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	I'd prefer not too, but then I think about say superheroes for boys, with their unrealistic bodies and expectations too.
AA10673927	The link's a bit messed up. Fix it and I'll love to help!<br>  <br>  [:|`|SEzIkGNiaa	The link doesnt work.  If you fix them, I will come back to help you :)|`|7585zXZIaa	Taylor momsens hair if you are a teen|`|B6BUR6zJaa	I would recommend shaving it all off.  When it begins to grow back, you will so grateful just to have hair that you will, more than likely, not give a hoot about how it is styled.  You should be so happy just to have something up top again that you will have more time to worry about the truly important things in life.<br>  <br>  And if that doesn't work, I would try an Audrey Hepburn look.|`|Ev473XbHaa	I can't see your picture, could you put the link instead of a copy and paste thing?|`|1jltjtjSaa	uhm ur picture link is uh... un linkable|`|J4CMYwACaa	i like hair, i like to put it in my pants, if you cut it will you send it to me? id cut it all off and send it to me. yeah k i have to go. oh wait, youre a blond right?|`|g0o1YnlJaa	How old are you? If you are around 20 then these will look great! or even an older teen! Here a a few really cute hair styles:|`|MzeyUgR9aa	You put the HTML code.

AA11920812	At that point my son loved avacado. Eventually, I added chopped tomatoes and garlic to it to see how he did. Not very spicy mind you but he did eat it. Also, bananas cut up really small. You can try some pasta or rice.<br>  <br>  For more finger food ideas you can try raisins and cheerios. When my kids first started eating I`d cut them in half. Time consuming, but it aleviated the choking risk. Also, gerber makes awesome finger foods. My son loved the yogurt puffs and at two still loves to munch on those. The sweet potato puffs and banana puffs are good as well. They even have freeze dried corn.<br>  <br>  If she is doing really well you can try pureeing whatever you had for dinner. I`d try to plan dinner to be simple. So, a meat and potato (mashed for baby) along with a veggie. I`d puree in a small food processor if needed. Eventually, I just pureed whatever we were eating once they were okay with the basics.<br>  <br>  Annabel Karmel has really great kids cookbooks. I enjoy her recipes and she uses veggies in creative ways that get kids to eat them. I have found them especially useful during my oldests food strikes.|`|VJnmHFR0aa	At six months my daughters feeding schedule was:<br>  <br>  10AM 7oz milk<br>  1PM  half a small jar of porridge with half a small jar of fruit mixed in it<br>           half a petit filous<br>  4PM  7 oz milk<br>           three quarters of a small jar<br>           half a small jar baby dessert<br>  7PM  three quarters of a small jar<br>           half a petit filous<br>  10PM 7oz milk<br>  <br>  She'd also have two beakers of water over the course of the day.<br>  <br>  I did start mix feeding her at 18 weeks though. She was sleeping for twelve hours over night.  I do seem to remember that I had to increase her food at about seven months.|`|bXRuC1ASaa	You can just kinda use your judgement on things.  If she seems like she wants to eat more, then start to offer her more.  I'm surprised she likes veggies more then fruits..can she teach my son some lessons on that? lol<br>  <br>  At around 7 months I started feeding my son whatever we were having, except obviously smaller bites.  Also, I was/am giving three small meals in addition to the milk.  You can try giving her whole milk yogurt with some fruit in it for breakfast, or oatmeal if you prefer.<br>  <br>  To me, feeding is such a fun part of parenting! I love being able to experiment and find out the things my babies like to eat.|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	At 6 months, my daughter was also eating little squares of toast, really small, cooked pasta pieces, again small, and small bite-size pieces of banana.  She liked the banana better than the jarred banana.
CdJtH0xdaa	I'd let her make it. It'd be so much more awesome to say that you got this dress made ESPECIALLY for you. If you're worried about the outcome, I'd draw a sketch for your mom's friend. Good luck to you, and happy graduation!|`|0ZiGgBFaaa	Let her make the dress. Just because it doesnt come out how u want it doesn't mean it won't be cute.  I let my brother's girlfriend make my dress for winter formal, and it wasn't exactly what i was looking for, but it turned out great and I got so many compliments! The best part is, you dont have to worry about some one else having the same dress as you! The worst that can happen is it isn't EXACTLY what u wanted. It could still be a good thing. Go for it! Hope I helped!|`|SWsDa1iXaa	I would just stick to buying a dress.|`|JAZWe8A6aa	Well since you don't know how it's going to come out, then I would probably just want to buy my own dress. Just tell her it's no disrespect toward her personally or anything, you just want to be able to go shopping and pick out your own dress.<br>  <br>  If you do let her design your dress for you, be very specific, don't leave anything out. I mean, maybe even have a picture or something of what you want it to exactly look like. <br>  <br>  The ultimate decision in the end though is yours. If it were me, I would probably buy my own dress instead of letting someone else design it for me just because in my head I know what I want so then I could choose accordingly. Letting someone else design it is kinda risking it. But you'll probably look gorgeous either way!|`|SEzIkGNiaa	I would just buy a dress.  That way you can choose the color, style and you can try it on.  And you can no ahead of time if you like the dress.<br>  If you get a designer dress, what happens if you don't like it?  You are FORCED to wear it, well it would be respectful if you did.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	If she is a real designer she should draw it up for you at first and if it is what you want why wouldn't you like it?
Kl5kN2Qaaa	i feel ur pain..i had the same thing happen to me yesterday, :( <br>  God willing next month we wil b pregnant...there could always b a possibility that the spotting is implantation, with my first 2 pregnancies i got light pink spotting for a few days.take a test just incase u r prgnant ...go0o0d luk, trillions of baby dust to u :)|`|lTkYWiy5aa	Feeling your pain!<br>  <br>  Lots of baby dust to you for next month!|`|TcgUE0WYaa	bless you - are you sure its not implantation bleeding/ xx|`|yp9rEMSraa	Aww....I hope you get your desired result next month...I will be there with you...lots and lots of baby dust for next month|`|o6goJq15aa	Oh, I know how much this hurts.. I'm sorry that you didn't get pregnant this month! <br>  Good luck, sending you baby dust for next month!!!
nxHztcslaa	well the good news is that it definitely wont be long!! there is a few things you could try to speed things up... good old fashioned sex is a winner for alot of people.. lots of walking, up stairs is a good way..eating spicy food!! i was told by my midwife to get down on all fours and crawl around.. not sure about that one! hehehe.. anyways it sounds like you are pretty close so hopefully you wont need anything to help..|`|rFwGnZIJaa	I was 2 cm dilated and having regular contractions for over a month till I was induced in my 39th week. It was quite awful. At the beginning of my last month I thought I was going into labor and was in the hospital for 12 hours trying to get my labor to progress but my contractions just stayed the same neither stopping or going further. I went in on one other occasion and I was still the same despite all the contractions and pain. I finally said I had enough and was induced. My labor lasted 10 hours with 10 minutes of pushing. Anyway, point is you won't know till you get there.|`|fI0BcqxUaa	It could be very soon or it could stall for a few days.  If this is your first child, it could be slower than if you've had children in the past.  <br>  <br>  My first child was late by two weeks and finally had to be induced with pitocin, and even then, it was a 26 hour delivery process.  My second child was only three days late and came in 16 hours without induction.  I've also known plenty of mothers who delivered in three or four hours.<br>  <br>  I would suggest taking soothing baths.  Get your husband or partner to help you in and out, try to relax as much as you possibly can.  If you have not made a birth plan, do so now!<br>  <br>  Get out the best and most comfortable pairs of socks you own.  Put one on and listen to some great music by candlelight!  Breathe deeply and slowly.  Enjoy these last moments of peace before the baby arrives!<br>  <br>  Best wishes for a happy birth!|`|CKnHMYHnaa	If your labor doesn't begin on its own soon, they may have to induce you.  Doctors don't like for mothers to go too long after their due date. If they haven't done a non-stress test on your baby yet, they should be doing one soon.|`|QwPpLgX7aa	I would talk to ur doctor about striping ur membranes it could help.  You should WALK. It really works (walking helped me go into active labor).  Your doctor probally will not let you go past 42 weeks. Talk to him about enducing ur labor.  Are you sure ur due date is correct.|`|DNygQdmVaa	Could be a few more days, Id say 2 or 3, could be longer.

I have met many Jennas in my time. How about Jenny? It's dying out a little and it's still a beautiful name.For a middle name, I would say Diana or Jean [Jenny Diana or Jennifer Jean].<br>  Aubrey: I would definitely change that to Audrey. Aubrey is a man's name and it sounds very-stuffed up and indelicate for your beautiful baby girl. I would change it to Audrey and use the middle name Kathleen, like Audrey Hepburn.<br>  Madison: Hate it. Sorry, but I do. I think that it's a very medicore name and I could never see potential in anybody named Madison.<br>  Tiler: Awful. I'm so sorry to offend but I dislike these modern names terribly. For both Madison and Tiler I would go for something classier, such as Victoria, Elizabeth, Emma, Emily, Diana, Jennifer, Katherine, Maria, Rose, Scarlett, etc. I love Victorian names and I think that they sound so pretty and delicate on a baby girl, much more than names like Tiler and Madison which is, essentially, the name of a Street!<br>  Megan: I think it is beautiful but would spell it Meagan.<br>  <br>  Nicholas: I don't like Nicholas but I like idea of an N name. Perhaps Nathaniel?<br>  Scott: Very nice but too common. I think that Sean, spelt that way and that way only!, is beautiful.<br>  Jake: Too overused since Twilight. How about John? People think that it is too old-fashioned but I actually know a guy called John who is 14 and it suits him very well, it doesn't seem old-fashioned at all. If you don't like John, how about Jack or James?<br>  Dane: Like it but then again don't like the N. Perhaps Dale?

s4aX6bF6aa	i gave my little ones popsicles when they were teething around 5-6 months...and i gave them nibbles of my ice cream now and again...no harm no foul.|`|WirFwirLaa	Popsicles: 8 months old, he had the stomach flu and the ped. told me to feed him nothing but popsicles, pedialyte and jello for 24 hours.<br>  <br>  Ice Cream: 11 months. Grandma kept hounding me about giving him ice cream so I finally gave in and let her give him a small bowl. Of course, he loved it...more so than the popsicles!|`|9ZTYDMNPaa	Of coarse.  There is not a rule book.  We as parents for the most part make up the rules.  Dr's just give us suggestions.  For teething purposes a little bit of tylenol and put on babies gums.  It will numb their gums.  The popcycle was a good idea but a messy one.|`|z5EDtgtyaa	my daughter was 8 months old. she just has some of plain vanilla soft serve. we where at a buffet restaurant, she loved it. I don't see anything wrong with it, as long as it's not everyday.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	A popsicle is not ice cream.   My oldest had ice cream when he was 12 months +, my youngest has never had ice cream as when he tried whole milk at 12 months he turned out to be allergic.|`|fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	I let our son have some on his first birthday.

She loved it. She had her first ice cream when she was like 7 months. I didnt give it to her. She was sitting on a blanket on the grass with my family at my cousins daughters first birthday. The grandmother of the little girl thought it was her granddaughter and just started shoveling ice cream in her mouth. We were all just shocked for a second and then I took the spoon away. She told me i couldn't do that it was her grand daughter. I told her no it wasn't it was my daughter she felt horrible ( when I say shoveling I mean huge spoon fulls, she manged to get 3-4 in her mouth in just a few seconds) I was pretty unhappy with that.<br>  <br>  She had her first cone when she was like a year and a half or so ( her second summer) adn she loved it. She was a cute little mess.|`|iLLoc003aa	I bought them their first ice cream cone when they were 1 but I am sure I gave them a lick of an ice cream or popsicle when they were younger...I have my son a blow pop when he was like 10 months old and it was the funniest thing ever..I took a picture of him and his face looked like he just discovered the greatest thing ever...he looked shocked, happy, elated, and like he would beat you if you took that sucker away! It was priceless!|`|USooqQlWaa	Mine were both babies...I'm sure far less than a year old...is it bad to give a baby ice cream?

zK1V9Mu7aa	I know this isn't answering your question, but I had an Avent Steam Steriliser and just found it so annoying. In the end we just bought a big plastic container and some milton tablets.<br>  You simply fill the container full of water,put a tablet in, put all your bottles, teats, dummies etc in it and wait 15 minutes until they are sterile and good to go. The water is sterile for 24 hours. Also there is no need for boiling water, so you never burn yourself.<br>  Honestly, this method has been a god send, if a dummy falls on the floor- straight in the container and then it's good to go in 15 minutes!<br>  That's just my way though,other Mums may not agree with me :-)<br>  <br>  XX|`|op55FtqYaa	Here's what you do:<br>  <br>  Wash bottles<br>  Get them in a pot of hot water, boil them for 10 minutes then soak in sterlising fluid. <br>  Use bottles when needed.<br>  <br>  Abandon the sterliser! <br>  <br>  When you're baby is about 10/11 months she won't need her stuff sterilised anymore. Don't panic!|`|E5CnUdhsaa	the amount of wate...there should be a line on the actual system itself...and the amount of bottles you put in wont be effected|`|2pxiK9waaa	your daughter won't get ill. Sterilizers were invented for panicky first time moms. They're really not necessary. You can boil brand new bottles in a pot of water for ten minutes and leave them there to cool. They will be sterile. You also don't need to sterilize them each time you use them. If you have a dishwasher, they'll be sterile after each cycle in the dishwasher. If you don't have a dishwasher, just wash in warm, soapy water, and be sure to rinse well. I only sterilize in a boiling pot of water if the baby's been sick or every month or two.|`|50lIaC8zaa	You put in 90ml and no the amount of bottles makes no difference, make sure you put 90ml in every time otherwise they wont sterilise properly. xx
6a3e68591559079347d376d3ad8f42c0aa	Yes he can fight for custody if the mother is not doing what she suppose to be doing as a mother.Yes he can have a DNA test done to determined if he's the father.If he not then he can still help her with the child.|`|ibj4lPkvaa	Somebody else can step up and contest his paternity. The court would order a paternity test. The biological father would be given rights and he would not have anymore.<br>  <br>  If she and her bf broke up and he wasn't really the father, all she has to do is ask the court to do a paternity test. He would have no legal rights whatsoever.<br>  <br>  Bottom line: the biological father has the rights no matter what it says on the birth certificate.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	The real father can order a paternity test at any time. If they were to break up the boyfriend could order a paternity test as well to excuse him from legal responsibilities.<br>  <br>  Unless your sister lives on the streets, does drugs, or abuses her child she won't lose custody. The courts prefer children stay with mom.<br>  <br>  Birth certificates can be changed, its not a big deal either way.|`|be5076c0b98b495ffe00aade08f96b65aa	I will try to answer as best as I can, but the best thing you can do is seek legal advice to be sure others, including myself, don't tell you wrong.<br>  <br>  1. If the current boyfriend wants to sign the birth certificate, then he should do so. However, because there is doubt, then a DNA test should be ordered any way, before either men sign it. If the baby turns out to be the other guy's, and he doesn't want the responsibility, he will then have to sign his rights over to the boyfriend. If, however, he accepts the responsibility, then that means he accepts paying child support. I don't if they do this or not, but she could see if the hospital will allow her to not name a father due to the circumstances, and the unknown of what will happen, should the child not be her boyfriend's. The boyfriend will just have to understand for now. Keep in mind, that yes it does mean on paper he is the father of this baby, but should the real father, if not him, order a DNA test, and it prove to be his, and he wants to be named the father, that is his right.<br>  <br>  2. As far as him being able to order the DNA test without legal aid, I doubt it would be possible. I mean they could consent outside of court, but the odds of that happening are probably slim, and I would advise against it. If he wants the DNA test, and your sister refuses, then he will have to get a lawyer, pay legal fees, and for the test, if it ends up not being his. If it is his, however, I am not sure how the costs would be divided, if at all.<br>  <br>  3. If your sister has her boyfriend sign the birth certificate, and they split up, you can almost bet your bottom dollar that the boyfriend, knowing what he knows, will take her to court and order a DNA test for him. If it ends up not being his, then he will not be ordered to pay child support. Then in order to get child support, she will have to get a DNA test from the other guy, and see what the results are. If it's positive, then she may be able to get child support. However, the court will look at who she had sign the birth certificate, how long it's been since the baby's birth, as well as if she ever contacted him to notify him of the pregnancy and that it was possibly his, when ordering child support.<br>  <br>  4. If he is on the birth certificate, and your sister doesn't name the other possible father, then yes he can fight for custody. Even if she does name the other person, they will then do a court ordered DNA test. If the boyfriend proves not to be the father, legally he would have no rights. If he does prove to be, then you know he has the right the child and can continue to fight for custody. <br>  <br>  5. Again, remember the birth certificate is only a piece of paper. Although it is legal, for the time being, it can be changed. If there is any doubt in your sister's mind, I would recommend her getting a lawyer ASAP, and going from there. This way. if the boyfriend truly wants to be apart of this baby's life and wants 100% responsibility, then they can start the adoption process. They will do a DNA test, and if negative, they will notify the other individual, if he responds, then she could try to have him sign over his rights to the boyfriend, and again thus the adoption would begin. If he doesn't respond, then his rights will automatically be terminated within so many days, and again the adoption process would ensue. <br>  <br>  I'm not a lawyer, so please don't consider this legal advice, it's simply basic knowledge on how they handle things in my state. Good luck!
277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	Let me ask my mother, I will get back to you on this.  She used to work for a lawyer so she know most if not all of the custody rules.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  she says<br>  <br>  really doesn't have a lot of choices.  she can't do anything on her own.  the minute she tried to do anything on her own, she is right, they would dissappear.  she needs to go to social services and report it as a child welfare/abandonment case.  they will investigate.  she needs to give them the address of where the child is so that the interviewing starts there.  that way they will know right off the bat what the situation is.  she should tell them that she has no idea where the parents are as they move every few weeks, are unemployed etc.  if the authorities have to track them down, it makes them look worse.  while social services is looking into it, they may well put the baby in a foster home.  they can petition the courts to be the foster home and if they are qualified, may be able to do just that.  if not, the baby is still better of in a foster home than in the care of the parents. <br>  they need to start with social services.  like i said, do not tell them where the parents are - it will make the parents look very irresponsible.<br>  hope this helps.|`|6nn7f41Faa	Get a VERY good lawyer and anonymously consult Child Protective Services. Ask both the lawyer and CPS how you can go about having their rights terminated. You'll have to prove they are unfit parents, and assuming that the entire town knows this, there's some very good evidence there. If you know any previous landlords, consult them too, as proof that they were unable to provide for themselves, let alone a child.<br>  <br>  If their rights are terminated, and you and your grandmother can prove that you both have been providing for this child and raising her, then chances are, you may be able to get custody of her, but you also have to prove that you are financially able to provide for her.<br>  <br>  I also suggest asking this in the Law and Ethics section, but be sure to get a good lawyer.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|CE3bmj65aa	Wow, that is crazy.  I couldn't even imagine not having my baby.  You need to talk to a lawyer and you will have to go to court and prove they are unfit parents.  Usually they try to give the baby to another family member, but since you have been raising the baby it may be different.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	You have no biological relation to this child. The best you can do is get your home or your grandmother's home certified for foster care, document everything these people do/don't do, get witnesses, then report them to CPS as bad parents and ask for legal custody as a foster parent while the baby's real parents complete education on how to properly care for a kid.<br>  <br>  If they are as lazy as you make them sound maybe the won't bother and eventually you could adopt your foster daughter.|`|59SM8kFIaa	you have to report  the mom and dad,  ad cps child protective service will keep the baby, or let you keep her if you pass what they want you too!! that is all you can do , they try to give baby to family or some one that already has her!!! good luck
UNWLaJbKaa	We've been trying for 3 months, and every month I just got disappointed.  I to had a SLP, which I corrected by taking Vitamin B6.  It moved my typical 19 day ovulation to day 14 :)  the first month of taking it. <br>   So this month I relaxed, and told myself I'm not going to get worked up, and noticed that my breasts were so sore on the sides, and under my armpits, and I had small waves of nausea (very small).. so I tested today and I got my first positive.  <br>  Don't give up, and try to relax.  I know it's hard, and I couldn't do it the first few months, but the month i'm nonchalant about getting pregnant I get pregnant.. Go figure.<br>  <br>  It will happen for you!

AA10730513	I think that #1, you should have your daughter weighed at the doctor's office, dressed pretty much the same way she was dressed last time you had her weighed. -- Different scales can vary, especially if you weren't using scales that are properly set & designed for babies. <br>  <br>  #2, Have you mentioned the spitup and the not sleeping to your mother in law? Instead of accusing her of feeding cereal (which she probably is), come at her from more of a concerned parent angle. Let her know that your daughter's spitup was kind of on the solid side and that she isn't sleeping well at night. Ask her about how much your little girl sleeps at her house and if she can try to change the nap schedule a bit so that you and your husband can get some sleep. (But keep in mind, some kids are very difficult to control sleep schedules for. So your MIL might not be able to do it.)<br>  <br>  #3, If this is bothering you as much as I think it is, look into other childcare options. Staying with family really would be best for a few more months. But if your mother in law is doing anything to cause significant weight gain or other potential health problems, you may have to take your daughter elsewhere. <br>  <br>  I hope you can work this out in a way that doesn't cause a lot of hard feelings in the family.|`|y6g0RnuAaa	You know that she is obviously undermining you and giving her cereal. Besides her being way too young for cereal, she is not getting proper nutrition. All of her nutrition should be coming from formula- nothing else. I have no other advice for you besides taking your daughter out of her care. I know that may not be possible. I hope everything works out. You guys must be exhausted.<br>  <br>  I love the name Kylie BTW.|`|sAbah6dTaa	no i don't think you are overreacting... but cereal doesn't hurt them helps them grow. we gave some to my daughter when she was a month old to help her sleep through the night. nothing is wrong with her, she is waay ahead for her age.|`|5QicX6O4aa	You are absolutely not overreacting at all. #1 issue you stated---she 'accidentally' gave her cereal?<br>  #2 issue---your MIL said "it's not like I'm giving her cereal'?<br>  #3---she's still too young to have cereal, the spit up is proof.<br>  #4 issue---No way should she be sleeping so much during the day.<br>  <br>  Trust your gut feel, which basically, you stated. You are correct in your assessments.<br>  <br>  Since you & hub both work, in my humble opinion, I'd find a great daycare. Why on earth would your MIL cut the nipples off the bottle if she 'isn't giving her cereal' & especially, Dr's orders yet.<br>  <br>  STAND & STAY STRONG! God Bless caring moms like you!|`|ajRAQhaZaa	<a href="http://canget.iiiii.info" rel="nofollow">http://canget.iiiii.info</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|OuuYoSBeaa	how did you weigh her. if you are putting her on your bathroom scale, its not going to be accurate. i put my cat on mine and it said 14 pounds, but at the vet the following week, he was only 9.5.<br>  i dont think she would have gained 6 pounds in 4 weeks even with baby cereal being fed to her behind your back, actually im sure she wouldnt. I started my kids on cereal early and they gained weight as normal.<br>  As for the MIL, if you cant proove she is feeding cereal, and she wont admit it, there isnt much you can do besides find a new sitter. if you demand she not feed her cereal, and she really isnt, there is going to be a fight.|`|p9GOxzsNaa	Babies sometimes get their days and nights mixed up. There is no proof that your MIL is giving cereal, so believe her and share with her the doctor's information that the baby is only on milk. As parents, you definately need to have the baby sleep more at night so in the daytime she will be more awake, and need to work on more awake time during the day and more sleep time at night. Try the Weissbluth's methods for sleeptime for naps and nighttime. Perhaps keep a diary of activities and sleep time during the day and night for a few days and over the weekend. If the baby is up all night, the baby will need to sleep all day except when hungry, so you need to work in tandem with your MIL to make the change to sleep at night, and then the baby will be more awake in the day.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I don't think you're overreacting at all. That your mother said she 'accidentally' cut the bottle nipple open is just ridiculous. How do you 'accidentally' cut open the nipple on a bottle? And if it really were an accident, can you trust her not to put knives around your kid if she somehow ends up using knives on your kid's bottle?<br>  <br>  I would take your baby in for her 3month checkup and ask her doctor about the weight gain. Tell him what you think may be happening. Have the doctor write down specifically what the baby should and shouldn't be eating, and then show that paper to your mil. Tell her, "This is what the doctor says is safe for my daughter. What do you think?" <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	jumping to conclusions

Up his left arm, he has 4 different suns, tribal artwork that he designed himself and a tribal seahorse. On his right arm, he has a Canada tattoo, a tattoo of the Cruxifiction, his band's logo, the James Blunt album girl on his right shoulder with her hair flowing into circles, another of his favourite band's girls with an umbrella (The Chariot).

JAZWe8A6aa	Well I think that it's very good to be cautious about your safety, so that's good. As far as what to do to get home, I guess there's a few options that you've mentioned that would probably work. <br>  <br>  Walking back to school and taking the after school bus- Well since you said it would take about an hour and it would be a chilling forty-five degrees out, I would leave that as one of the last alternatives. <br>  <br>  Taking a city bus home- I think this would be the best choice, because the bus would be able to pick you up right at your destination and take you straight home. You wouldn't have to walk back to the school in the chilling weather, and you would most likely be more safe. Walking by yourself does have a lot of dangers involved in it, so I would take the city bus because there are other people on there and if anything seems suspicious you can tell the bus driver. <br>  <br>  So in the end, I would probably recommend taking the city bus; it's less dangerous and you probably will be more comfortable doing that than walking all the way to the school and then taking the bus that way. That's just my opinion. Whatever you choose, I hope you stay safe and out of trouble. Best of luck.|`|AA10673927	Whoa, walking home would be scary and really dangerous. You should ask around to see if your friends' parents could pick you up or something of the sort.

If any other classmates are going to be their with you, ask if they could give you a ride. Even if you don't know them, still ask. You could also talk to whomever is organizing this and explain why you won't be able to make it. I'm sure they will understand. Your safety is more important than a fashion show. You could ask a neighbor or someone you know well if they could possibly bring you home from the event.|`|DauMaNUjaa	I don't like the idea of taking a bus alone especially if it's your first time, and NOT NOT WALK. Do you think you could ask a friend to give you a ride home, or ask your parents if they can arrange a ride via a friend or grandparent? <br>  <br>  stay safe!|`|Nnqw6AU3aa	Walking on the side of a major highway<br>  sounds really dangerous!<br>  <br>  Especially if you're not sure what you're<br>  doing.<br>  <br>  Ask your parents to call the school and<br>  see what they can do or try and get a ride<br>  with someone else who is going there.<br>  <br>  Explain to the school and hope they<br>  understand.<br>  <br>  :]
1S7uXsInaa	Use the size 1.  They may be big, but big is better than pee all over.  I know that when my son starts leaking that means it is time to go up to the next size.  Weight really has nothing to do with it.  Babies can carry weight in different parts of their bodies.|`|Hf5doDxsaa	Something like this kept happening to me when my daughter was just a few weeks old.  It seemed like every timee she had a BM it would leak onto her clothes.  I started making sure her diapers were a lot tighter and the problem was solved.  Don't worry about them being too tight-they're made out of a stretchy material.|`|c73QkZ2haa	What brand of diapers are you using? It may be as simple as switching what brand your using. Not all diapers work for all babies for some reason. When my sons in pampers he leaks like crazy but in huggies he doesnt leak at all.|`|75HzIpSraa	I would try the size 1. If that doesn't work try a different brand! Oh and if his belly button is not healed make sure fold down the diaper so it doesn't irritate it.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Keep him in the size 1 diapers.<br>  <br>  The charts on diapers aren't always accurate and often times your baby will be ready to move on to the next size before he reaches the max weight for the size he's in. My son still, by the charts, could be in a size 3 diaper but we moved him into size 4s because they fit nicer and don't leak as often.
JdgEp2X1aa	I don't think Zanni is short for anything, IDK it is probably a made up nickname.<br>  <br>  But a name that is similar to Zanni that I love is Zanna. I don't know but for some reason I like the name Zanna. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|Ow6lKFXiaa	Neither, it has no relation to Elizabeth or Rose.  I do not know the culture from which it comes, or if it's a complete name or nickname.  I will say that I like it.  It has a fun, innocent, sweet quality about it.  At least from my perspective.  It may very likely be just an affectionate nickname given to a lovely child by her parents.<br>  <br>  Edit: Tawnyangel made a very good observation missed by the rest of us.  It could very well be a nickname for Rozanne as is the Rosie you mention.  Thumbs up Tawnyangel.|`|a221wKz8aa	What the hell is a Zanni? Sounds like a sound you make when you are getting it on in the bedroom and your husband goes down on you<br>  <br>  "Ohhh, aahhh, ZANNI!!"|`|8ADDAtJuaa	i dont think so u might want to try Elizabeth Rose i think it sounds pretty. zanni could have got za from Elizabeth the ie from Rosie but i dont know where nn came from|`|b05fe691e5ceb5cc16ca919cd11e5eccaa	I think it could be shortened from Rozanne if the name was spelt like that.. you could call her Zanni or Rosie.. as far as Elizabeth goes I don't see it but maybe..|`|uszV7NEFaa	Makes me think of Zucchini...|`|VEkkn2Otaa	Neither where the heck did you get that!|`|DhmjLRoUaa	Zannis not even a name....|`|GQRs83Haaa	Why would it be shortened from Rosie...?<br>  I don't know... but I don't think it's from Rosie.|`|Dnr0Wbn3aa	just keep in mind it sounds like xanax|`|3eCcTT7Caa	uhm no its not even name<br>  it makes me think of bread|`|c3CVY87caa	neither... Roxanne|`|34VXCyvVaa	Zanni sounds like it's shortened from Alexandra.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	No.|`|LCLpSa5Faa	1) Teenage is one word <br>  2) It's not a name|`|2716717868fe21f32f85869cd02f81d8aa	No|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	no, it is short for Xanex
6ycnSoaRaa	well, of course it is too soon to tell if you are pregnant or not.... but as you know- your fertility rate is much higher after you concieve. If you want to have another baby, you should tell him that you are not on it and want to try again.... be honest. But if you arent wanting another little one so soon- then you should be doing the right thing and get back on the pill. You shouldnt lie to your spouse, that is the worst thing that you could ever do..... think hard.. good luck!|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	If you have unprotected sex then of course you can get pregnant. Especially since you just gave birth recently. <br>  Come one now.. common sense should tell you all of this. <br>  And why would you lie to your boyfriend? Now if you are pregnant, what are you going to do? Claim that you're one in 100 to get pregnant on birth control?|`|JGvSQOrhaa	anytime you have unprotected sex, you could be prego... hello..<br>  <br>  also, what a shady thing to do! Telling him you are on the pill when you are not.. what are you trying to do? trap him? I hope he finds out and drops you like a ton of bricks!|`|mbvpWNMeaa	It is possible, but if you are breast feeding and haven't had a period yet, you are probably okay this time.  Take a test in a couple of weeks, and next time use a condom.|`|sqaey2Siaa	What do you think? Why would you lie to your boyfriend when you just had a child two months ago? Come on now. If you have unprotected sex, there is always a chance of concieving. Wait and take a test.
Ccq8zEcnaa	It is normal for some women to get the morning sickness bout all over again in their third trimester, when hormone levels begin to spike again. If you are running fever though, you may have a virus. Other than that I wouldn't be too worried, call your doc and let him/her know what's going on to be safe. My doc gave me Phernergan to take for nausea, which is safe during pregnancy, and actually helps me sleep better at night.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	You might just have the stomach flu.<br>  <br>  Or you could be getting ready to deliver soon.  Any diarrhea?<br>  <br>  Make sure you stay hydrated or it will increase your contractions.|`|8zhFPCo3aa	totally normal, im 32 weeks and have the same thing, i asked my doctor and she said it is my uterus pressing against my stomach, meaning less food fits in it so it all just comes back up later on after i ate, she said to eat smaller meals!|`|z26vZUJVaa	I am having the same problem, I am 28 weeks and been sick like the first of my pregnancy. My dr just gave me nausea medicine and told me to increase my water intake..So far, that really hasn't helped any..If you find a cure let me know..|`|aYCjy8Neaa	I would call your doc just to let them know and to see what they think. But it sounds like you might just have a tummy bug. Make sure you drink LOTS of fluids so that you don't get dehydrated. But it's always safest to call your doc and let him know.
CKnHMYHnaa	There is a spell checker on here to assist in the formulation of questions and answers.  You may want to take advantage of it.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	nope|`|a65ec070ac47cd090dc1218e138ac837aa	I'm assuming that you are talking about morning sickness and yes, I had that and I still get the tiredness too. For the morning sickness, eat 5-6 small meals throughout the day. Saltine crackers, applesauce, soup, jello, yogurt, Vernor's pop, those little cups of fruit, and stuff like that helped me. Make sure you keep taking your prenatal vitamin. For some women their prenatal vitamin makes them feel sick. Stay hydrated. If you are vomiting you could end up getting dehydrated. As for the tiredness, take a nap. Good luck and hope you start feeling better.
AA10077992	Jordan still does this when he wants chocolate and he's 15 !<br>  <br>  I still use the 'naughty step' on 'Himindoors' so that the grandchildren know I mean what I say !<br>  <br>  Fair play to your little girl, she's got you sussed - chuck a wobbly and have a cuddle and some sweets !  Give her a cuddle afterwards, by all means - but the sweets will have to wait - it might even be the 'e' additives in them that give her the 'wobblies' !|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	I started to do it around 15 months. When they were under that age i would tell them NO! I would say the high chair could work to though.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Please don't put her in her high chair as a time out.<br>  She will get confused as to if she is being punished or not when she is eating<br>  Naughty corner/chair/step should be somewhere just associated with that|`|iiV3wpY3aa	2yrs|`|NbJbZXtGaa	You should never punish a tantrum. It is normal behavior and often uncontrollable for a child at that age. She does not yet have the skills to control her emotions, and her frustration comes out as a tantrum. You did the right thing by putting her in a safe place an allowing her to calm herself.  11 months is way too young for that type of discipline anyway.<br>  <br>  Betz has it right on. I never used time out/naughtly chair with my kids, and they are very well behaved.|`|RzYePezkaa	You can start time outs now do it 1 minute per age of the child it will take time for her to learn the concept of it but be patient she will get it eventually we use a warning system first time she gets corner,2nd time high chair facing wall third time we take a toy away from her which she then has to earn back.She is 2 now and understands the concept.Certain things though we do not put her in time out for she only gets them for serious things like spitting hitting biting throwing toys.For tantrums I make her stand there and sternly tell her no that tantrums do not work in this house and if she keeps it up she will go upstairs to bed or to the corner .|`|AA11406882	Sounds like she is starting her terrible twos early, this is common and girls are quite advanced,not sure if I would do the naughty thing at 1, my boy is 2 and I'm going to start introducing it soon. It's one minute per year that you put them on the naughty step/chair for.|`|ggilREqfaa	Yeah But I wouldnt have her high chair be the naughty chair because then she might connect her high chair with being naughty.<br>  You should have a specific chair and tell her that she is going into the naughty chair.<br>  I would use a naughty chair, but not her high chair.|`|maSZlX5Yaa	Uh i sorta read My mother think's I'm being too soft cuddling her so much- she say's I should start putting her in the chair! wrong and i thought the lil girl was saying Mommy pwut mwe in chiaw pwease LOL|`|QstEk6PZaa	2, we do, started at 2.|`|6EXOZu6Vaa	i think it will be tim in another 2 months. she probably doesn't understand punighment yet. at age 1.5 or 2 (cant remember) i started (very, very gently) spanking my kids. that was only for severe stuff. my son was such a troublemaker. he probably spent a good time of his day in timeout.|`|JIxAVONXaa	At her age her tantrums come from frustration from not being able to communicate or understand why you are saying no, not being able to understand her own emotions and testing her limits. This is completely normal for her age and she shouldn't be punished for it.<br>  <br>  You are right she does need to be safe while having a fit, such as her playpen, but stay with her for comfort and let her calm herself down. She needs that experience in how to calm and settle herself and work through those emotions. When she is done take her out and give her cuddles, talk about your feelings and give a name to her feelings. Teaching her the names of emotions and that they are normal emotions she should feel safe expressing in front of you will help limit the tantrums she will have when older, it will also help her learn to work out those emotions and actions in her mind to be able to do this on her own, without you there to fix them for her.<br>  <br>  What is the time out going to teach in this situation? That feeling sad, angry, frustrated or mad is wrong? They certinly are not wrong feelings just the way she is expressing them, which all comes down to her age and ability.|`|erKyfwSbaa	You can Absolutely start at 1. I started at about 10 months with my son and I am so glad I did.<br>  The rule of thumb is 1 minute per year of age. Explain in simple terms why they are getting a time out and let them sit for 1 min and them explain one more time why and give them a hug and let them play again.<br>  Sometimes it takes a few times of doing this, but follow-through and consistency are key. If you don't do both of those, your child won't totally understand Mom's boundaries.|`|iMaTMWMxaa	I think what you're doing sounds fine. She's just trying to get a handle of her emotions. They need a cuddle after a tantrum, because they've got themselves into a state and need help from their mummy/daddy to let them know everything is ok.<br>  <br>  If you're consistent, and don't give in to what she wants when she has a tantrum then she won't do it as often. <br>  <br>  I don't even use the chair for my 3 year old. Never worked for mine. They just know that Yes means Yes and No means No. (not that they don't ever have tantrums of course!!!)|`|nXLD2nChaa	Well. <br>  If you where to ignore her so she would eventually learn her lesson or just reward her when she`s good and give her a hug and a kiss and she`l start to understand you.<br>  Good Luck.<br>  Kids. What do you expect, cleverer than you think ah.|`|sW6GWlXXaa	2-3 years so they get used to why|`|pvrLSTZzaa	What's the difference if you put her in a chair or in the pay pen? As long as you have her in there with no toys and don't talk to her. After she is in there for one minute, there is NOTHING wrong with holding her and telling her that you love her. She needs to know that what she did was wrong and after her punishment, she needs to know that you still love her. My two year old sits in timeout and when her two minutes are done, she gets up and plays and nothing more is said. My five year old wants to talk to me about wheat she did wrong and wants to cuddle. Every kid is different.
40Q4gpi6aa	The best thing to do is get a pregnanct test done either by your doctor or with a HPT...<br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|XpLufXKFaa	My husband and I have been trying to conceive coming on month number 6. This past month I was 3 days late. I got extremely excited and took a pregnancy test, negative, sent my husband out for another one, and negative. After received two negatives - that night - I got mother natures "gift". The stress & anxiety of wanting it so bad could just be delaying your period. I hate to be the pessimist. <br>  <br>  But, the only way you will find out is to take a pregnancy test. I wish you the very best of luck!
ApyrV5J9aa	Yes. You can get it for up to 6 weeks, I believe. I actually had mine the same day AF was due, two days after I already had my positive pregnancy test! I called the Dr. right away and she informed me that is was very normal and can happen on and off for a couple weeks because sometimes blood takes a while to come out. Good luck!|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	absolutly.. more than likely it might be a few days earlier but yes it happens around that time of your cycle.|`|6TQFahm4aa	I did! and for a few days after that.  I thought something was wrong with my pregnancy bc i was spotting for about a week after i found out, but it was just old implantation bleeding. Good luck .
3CVfUiiJaa	I had mine after 8 weeks.  I had a section too and wasn't breastfeeding.  I think it's different for every woman.|`|kY6BXne8aa	You can probably plan to get it anytime now. They say about 6-10 weeks postpartum if you aren't nursing.
a2BBnAQ1aa	i just got off grounding a couple days ago actually. im always so friggin happy cuz my brother( i live with him) never tells me how long im grounded for, its usually just a week or 2 but i never really know. the first thing i do is get my phone and txt my bff and we go and hang out. our favourite place to go is starbucks cuz we go there everyday after school. so we go there and meet up with the rest of our friends and i get caught up on everything i missed for the past week, lol. then i get home, get on aim, or  text them all night. and get on myspace til i gotta go to bed, lol.|`|HcvqGMZraa	if its friends then i usually wait till the day after to ask my parents to hang out but if its phone and computer i use it as soon as i can. most the time i`m happy.they don't really say anything we just both know that its over so i Just get the privileges back.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	Give my parents a big hug!

'Dru' is short for Drucilla (which was my aunt's name :)  Then, there's Drew Barrymore.  But Drue' is a bit unconventional and you don't really want your child having to spell her first name correctly for folks, like 10 times per day.  It would be like spelling Jim as 'Gym'.|`|mfRH2Wiiaa	I LOVE DRUE FOR A GIRL AND I THINK THAT IS GREAT THAT YOU ARE SPELLING IT DEIFFERENLY. =]|`|A1PLJKhUaa	nOoOoOoO!

pl7lWGZDaa	I LOVE the name Jack! It's so simple, it's wonderful. I would go with Jack Ryan, Jack Henry, or Jack William.

fYMWDQLGaa	Oooohh sounds like you are prego but give time to HPTs to detect the HCG levels. wait u for ur period.<br>  <br>  goooodluck hunnn... keep us posted|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You were testing far too soon darling. The early tests only work for 50% of women (actually a little less). Wait and see if you get your period before you test.|`|2b302d308ce4b1da613b5ad7a99843e2aa	Try a home pregnancy test again. You should be able to test first thing in the morning. If it comes up negative, try again in 2 days. If you want to you can also wait till after you see if your period comes or not. Sounds like you are having pregnancy signs, but they could also be signs of your period.<br>  <br>  Hope we both get our BFP soon.
8XjJzj7Naa	What procedure to you have done?<br>  That is all the same symptoms that I experienced when I first got pregnant, besides the sore boobs. Does your stomache hurt as well to the point were it hurts to lay on it? All the symptoms sound promising, but yet only a pregnancy test could give you the results your looking for. All I can do is wish you the best of luck especially with your condition, I can only imagaine the ups and downs you go through each month wondering if your pregnant or if its just another let down. I have been through that before and I hope you get your BFP, this month!

XYBHM8aSaa	2 days after the Dr. did it.  I started bleeding and on and off contractions about 10 minutes after she did it until full labor came on.|`|EyKJ737daa	Your "sweep" sounds like our "stretch and massage of the cervix" here in Australia. Well here they do that at your 40 week appointment.  As you mentioned, sometimes it works for women and they go in overnight and others still go in to be induced.  Well that was me, didn't work for me at all, just made me bleed a little.  All my babies were late. My first was 9 days late and induced, second was 7 days late and came spontaneous and third was also 9 days late and induced.  I was very lucky with both my inductions because they can result in c-sections, mine didn't and I was also lucky that they just got faster with each labour, 5hrs for my first and down to 2hrs 48mins for my third.  Good luck sweetie and I truly hope it works for you xx
UYfqzCoMaa	I had the same issue when I was pregnant with my last. What I ended up having to do so that I could sleep at night for more than an hour at a time was, I got a body pillow. I put that under my belly and between my legs to help take some of the pressure off. I then put some other regular pillows right behind my back to help support that. It seemed to really help.|`|98WKYtfwaa	Get a body pillow and a maternity belt. The body pillow will help you get comfortable and the maternity belt takes the weight off your back and bum area. <br>  <br>  I had the same thing, i think the both of these help a great deal.|`|8wVj8odOaa	just think... another 19 weeks of feeling uncomfortable!!! (I feel your pain)<br>  <br>  Only thing I can suggest is pillows.. lots of pillows... a body pillow is a pregnant womans best friend and best of all you can get one for a little as $10!|`|ofz43OY4aa	you poor thing i remember that being one of the worst things about being pregnant, try laying on your side with a pillow under you tummy and between your legs, being supported helped me and i know loads of other women who would agree|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	As far as sleeping goes it is just one of those things that you have to bear through.  I find sleeping with a body pillow and have part in between my legs takes some pressure off.|`|152f135798bd6600f22951029f24cbcbaa	i wished i could say it gets better but it only gets worse...im almost 33 weeks an i never sleep good anymore!! sorry!|`|c5AJGcYcaa	I just asked my doctor this question this morning because im getting to where i cannot get a good nights sleep (23 wks). <br>  My doctor said that at his point in time your body is starting to prepare for baby. So you will prob not get a full 8 hrs of sleep anymore, because your brain is re-programing itself to how life will be when baby gets here, getting up doing what you have to do, and then going back to sleep.<br>  She did tell me that it's safe to take a tylenol pm or half a unisome once in a while. But not to take them on a regular basis.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps a little bit<br>  Good luck|`|QwPpLgX7aa	It is part of being pregnant and just gets worse.  Buy a couple body pillows. (you can get them a walmart for like 10$).  I put one between my legs and then one on each side of me.  I hope this works for you.  Hang in there and congrats!!!|`|5NBJUALFaa	try eating less.. food = weight gain = greater pressure on your ***.
qsjGSXaRaa	Personally, I think a little television in small doses is not harmful. Besides, at only months old, the baby's attention span is so short that they're only looking at the T.V for minutes and then staring off at other things. At least that's how my nearly 4-month old is. If I have her in the livingroom, I will sometimes put on shows for her that I've taped off of Nickelodeon channel. One of her favorites is the Barney episode where they sing "ABC's" and a cute song that teaches the 7 days of the week. I can't imagine how looking at the screen and seeing the vibrant colors (Barney is big and purple so she seems to be amused by this) is going to harm her. Also, I wouldn't be surprised if she learns her ABC's and days of the week very early on! :o)|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I think its fine to put your baby in front of the TV when you need to get stuff done. Turn on Nick Jr and go wash the dishes or cook a meal... but the TV shouldn't be on for him too much. Even though he is too small to really understand I would still make sure he's watching toddler programing and not law and order, you know? (And there is no tv for babies that is educational, but a happy show is definately better than adult programing)|`|311bce43c0d6a6dc9442d046a8943886aa	Its fine, Dont listen to otherwise...They enjoy seeing the different colors and movement on children shows, I put my daughter in her bouncer and let her watch the baby channel and she loved it!...shes almost 4 months old, No i dont do it regularly or long periods of time ( i enjoy holding her to much)lol, just once in a while to give her something new to look at,...and my other two children, they watched dora and learned alot of new spanish words and other things from noggin!...:) your son will be just fine :)|`|2c556debd7c1c18834aeac39fbfe496caa	My son loved to watch wheel of fortune from the age of 3 to 7 months..I think it just depends on what you are letting him watch and how often. As he got older I only let him watch Sesame Street and Mr. Rogers..My son grew up fine and graduated 13th out of 430 students..|`|ehvzQRkkaa	My son was the same! As long as you not using the tv as a replacement for you!|`|sAbah6dTaa	not all tv is bad, they do learn a lot from interaction, but they learn other things too, we loved dora and elmo.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	Its not bad unless you are doing it for HOURS... 1 or 2 hours is the max any child of any age should watch TV...  Excessive tv watching has been linked to ADD and attention issues. Because of the scenes flashing so much, the talking and the concentration they need to watch there brain can develop differently giving them some learning disabilities later in life. It wires there thinking patterned differently. If he likes  few shows... thats not a problem. Dont let them watch right before bed, since TV will hyper stimulate the brain and make them not want to sleep for longer periods of time. I let my daughter watch for 1 hour and then I turn it off, we do games and play things, but I dont let her depend on the TV as her friend.|`|7HMVsRFmaa	Personally i would never ever do that.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	actually the colors and sounds help stimulate the brain... its fine.|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	how about turning on some classic music or something while he's playing. he's really too young to understand whats going on anyways. if you do let him watch tv, just limit the time. my son is 21 months old and when he gets up in the morning we watch mickey mouse playhouse then handy manny. then he eats breakfast and we play. but usually i will have on an elmo dvd during the evening and he will stop and watch it periodically while playing. i think that tv is fine as long as its in moderation. playing classic music really stimulates brain development. try reading to him as well. i have been reading to my son since before he was born and he absolutely loves books! i really think it has helped him with verbal skills.
KHZ0qwqfaa	Okay, not to dwell on the shoulda coulda woulda's but I I think you should have toured the place before excepting the job.  I have seen pretty horrid day cares that make it past inspection, you would be surprised.  If you will be part of the learning program there, maybe you can suggest A LOT it sounds like, of improvements, but seeing as though you are 17, I assuming you are just a helper and not an actual provider.  But you should not put yourself in a situation for you to uncomfortable even if she is marrying your cousin, because you never know that if you staying there, will make situations worst.  You should always be honest with a person about Child care, even if your child is not going there.  I am speaking from being a very picky first time mom, to changing my daughters daycare to a very reputable Kinder Care Learning center and was willing to pay the $100 more a week.  I know you are young but just imagine a sibling or your future child going there.  Tell her that you think there needs to be improvements, do some research on other daycares and give her some advice, she should nhot take it the wrong way or else she does not take constructive critcism well.  Things can be fixed easily such as painting the fence outdoors, there should be a special paint that seals in rust, and try introducing some interactive games that can have the children move around.  I can give you one idea from my daughters school.  They actually bought styrofoam plates and let the kids slide on them and pretend they were iceskating.  Believe me you can take kids to far away places in one room.  I do it with my daughter when she comes home. We create a steering wheels from styrofoam plates and then I ask her where does she want to go and then we move around the house and when we get to the place we create something that we would see.  If the daycare is hard on budget, ask the childrens parent for a small school supply list, most of which can be picked up at dollar stores, crayons, stick glues, paper, etc...Hope all goes well|`|NbJbZXtGaa	Yeah, what Malwilhi said.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	you could turn them in anonymously and have them re-inspected.|`|x0PKm4qLaa	I have worked at many daycares- and the last one was much like you just described. I think there a a couple ways to approach this- one you could make this place a better environment for the children, clean it up and brighten it up  with decorations, hep the children by introducing fun games and enriching their lives by making it a better place.<br>  But then again if this is your first daycare job-this isn't a good place to start-you probably don't have all the tools and experience to be able to stay they long enough to better the place.<br>  You could always call DFS, Child Services, and have them come out and check out the place-they don't have to know who you are.<br>  And in a place like that- chances are it will be a stressful situation with the special needs children.<br>  I'd call DFS, then tell your boss you were offered a another job with better pay-I don't think you'll be happy there.<br>  But if your up for the challenge. and it will be a challenge-you could do a lot of good for those kids.<br>  Good Luck!|`|Cx5QtfXXaa	REPORT IT! HONESTLY THATS DISGUSTING! and you have to have windows in the daycare....thats nasty. I would NEVER send my child there. I would report it anonymously and quit so u cant get into trouble for being there. yea and rust for kids---HELLO...what kind of nasty place are they tryin to run----REPORT IT AND QUIT|`|z8w8T4ODaa	You need to contact your local daycare licensing office - look them up online - child care license office in your state. You can do it without giving your name. These little kids dont have a voice - you need to be the voice for them.|`|JIxAVONXaa	Always trust your gut instinct. The place sounds horrid, I would never place my son in her care.<br>  <br>  I would call whoever it is that deals with licensing in your city ( I am in Newfoundland and that is department of Child Youth Family Services, Health Canada) and if you do not want to leave your name or anything you do not have to but just lodge an inquiry about the daycare. They will send out a health officer/inspector (or whatever your equivalent is) and she will never know it was you who sent them.<br>  <br>  Also you should NEVER restrain a toddler or preschooler, regardless of mental capacity. If they are not on medication then there is good reason that they probably do not even need it. That is why training in ECE is so important, if the workers had positive behaviour guidance they wouldn't;t need to restrain a child they would know better ways of guiding the child's behaviour without physical restraint, they would also be able to curb much of the behaviour from even happening in the first place.|`|2pxiK9waaa	I'd call the police and get the number for reporting bad daycare practices and the health department. Make those calls anonymously. I wouldn't take the job there, as your name would be jeopardized if they are investigated, too.|`|d587552c069a9566f3cb4046a79c1035aa	I would place an anonymous call to the health inspector and have it checked out again. I can't imagine anyone taking their children to a place like that. I never would.
CdJtH0xdaa	I go to Subway for lunch, but sometimes I have movie theatre hot dogs and nachos for lunch. Delicious, I know. As for my son, he doesn't eat solids yet. It's just breast milk.|`|Rs3ITS1Iaa	I don't eat lunch at school.|`|DauMaNUjaa	I'm a vegan so my school is craaap for lunches. I usually bring noodles or a sandwich and some fruit and a soy yogurt.|`|mfBkH3qtaa	I eat lunch at school. Everyday there is a tray with a meat bread vegetable. Or we can have a basket which is usually some type of sandwich or something on bread with fries or tater tots ALWAYS. We get to choose if we have fruit or not. We have peaches mixed fruit pears oranges sometimes strawberry shortcake, or pumpkin pie or other deserts. We also can choose from white milk or chocolate milk sometimes strawberry or vanilla. We also can get water. And then we can get ice cream, or a snickers ice cream or a klondike.|`|SWsDa1iXaa	Well, I eat the school food and my parents just put money into the lunch account, so I can buy whatever. If it is outside food, I will usually get a gatorade, stuffed crust pizza w/ ranch dressing.<br>  Inside food consists of pasta and burgers and whatnot. :D|`|YQrKQ5PAaa	I bring lunch to school. <br>  <br>  I always have one fruit (Banana, raspberries, pears, etc.)<br>  <br>  I have something like Ritz mix or Cheese nips...<br>  <br>  And then I have a granola bar and or cheese stick.<br>  <br>  :S<br>  <br>  I don't think I eat enough. XD|`|H0sPCJQPaa	I usally eat salad, leftovers, and sandwiches.<br>  a piece of fruit<br>  and a treat (rice cakes, cookies etc.)<br>  And a drink<br>  <br>  I bring don't buy.|`|peQGGFPYaa	10 a week for lunch?? thats it? to get lunch at my school whatever they had that day was 3 dollars if you didnt like that they had other stuff but that was a dollar fifty for a hot dog and a dollar for a fry so you are already over 2 dollars a day. i would ask for a raise to 15 a week honestly i mean food expensive these days ten dollars for a whole week is not enough.|`|9zwSclnLaa	I also get $10 a week because I use $2 a day on the cafeteria food (which usually isn't half bad most days) and I usually get the entree, a side of fruit, a milk, some veggies, and maybe something like a cookie or pudding cup.|`|UHbh9kn2aa	Mini Pizza<br>  Ingredients(Sp?)<br>  .English Muffins<br>  .Pizza Sauce<br>  .Cheese<br>  .Pepperoni<br>  .Or other toppings<br>  Put pizza sauce on the english muffin top with toppings of your choice and put in the oven until brown :) its yummy or can be microwaved <br>  <br>  :]|`|AA11276512	I usually have a sandwich, water, a clementine, a small dessert, and a snack (ex. chex mix, chips, pretzels).<br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|dbf8Afhoaa	Today I ate a PB&J sandwhich and grapes and water.<br>  <br>  I always eat a sandwhich or a protein bar and some kind of fruit.<br>  And always water.<br>  :)|`|wqRwSaGSaa	i eat cheezeits from the vending machine<br>  and a coke.|`|1jltjtjSaa	i dont eat lunch. id keep the $
FL67UPPHaa	For a girl, I like Chloe and Aimee.<br>  <br>  Audrey is quite sweet, but I don't think it flows well with Rae. Too many Rs.<br>  <br>  I also prefer Anna, Hannah or Savannah... Havanna just sounds like a mix of those.<br>  <br>  For a boy, my favourite was Brendan. I think Londyn looks quite feminine, the spelling London might be better for a boy.<br>  <br>  Good luck choosing!|`|igvUbqkyaa	I LOVE the name Audrey but I don't think it sounds great with Rae (too much of the 'r' sound). And I also really like Norah (although I prefer the spelling Nora) but once again too much 'r' sound. So I guess the one that flows best is Aimee Rae. And I don't care for any of the boy's names but Brendan is the best.|`|Cj4i2pbTaa	I don't really care for any of the first names (or middle names for that matter, but as you said, they won't be changed).  Instead of Canyon, how about Carson?  After all, who wants to be named after a rocky crevice?|`|ZDDya5Ibaa	I love Havanna. I think its so beautiful, and unique. I'd call her "Anna." Londyn is cute, but I actually prefer it on a Girl.|`|TTyYx3vqaa	Absolutely love Branson!|`|KAj7GfeDaa	I like Branson. I only met one other boy with that name.|`|YLQpcjQPaa	Branson is nice|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Aimee, Chloe or Brendon are the ones I like.  BTW Jean is usually feminine spelling while Gene is the masculine (short for Eugene).  (It is masculine spelling in Fr. for John)
wWkfASTNaa	I did. I still have cramps now at 6 weeks. The sore breasts for me were more associated with ovulation and actually went away before I even tested. IMO, anytime there is a symptom that is abnormal for you, it could be a pregnancy symptom.|`|9hrJfhIIaa	Yes and yes. Well, I did anyway. I continued to have "period cramping" up until my 7th week - it's your body adjusting to your growing uterus.|`|oWAUb6vpaa	Yes. Early pregnancy symptoms can imitate those of your menstrual cycle so the answer is yes. <br>  <br>  Good luck, luv..|`|dCjsVLmjaa	YES, at least i did i thought i was getting my period because i started cramping 6th day of cramping i said thats not normal got a test and came out positive. Sore breast happened at around 3 weeks and i cramped untill my 8th week.|`|AA11197832	Yes you do get these symptoms while your pregnant.  But like you said it could also be that you are about to start.  So give it a couple weeks and if you dont start your "P" then take a test.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|AA12060541	Yes you do, hope that is good news!|`|pQ6ZowQZaa	These can both be symptoms of period, or pregnancy. It's hard to tell. and every woman is different, we all get different symptoms. I was SUPER tired, my breasts hurt, and I had really low abdominal cramping. Al you can do is take a test, but it might be too early for that. Sorry but all anyone can do is tell you that if you are sexually active, and fertile, you can be pregnant and that does happen when you are.|`|4q2fFHcKaa	Am also experiencing the same symptoms, am due 16th of this month.<br>  Have been cramping since just after last months period. With my last 4 pregnancies i had similar cramps,as if my period was about to start but for not as long as i have had this time. Have been told that this can happen( which i know due to experience) as it's just the uterus  expanding slightly and adjusting to the pregnancy.<br>  Hope you get the answers you are looking for, and good luck!!
4gZYucHMaa	My mom is toxic, she was jealous of me and put me down as a kid constantly, jealous of anything I did and it got worse when I became a mom. I do the complete opposite of her mothering, so far my kids are showing the rewards of what good parenting is.<br>  <br>  I haven't spoken to my mom in over 10 yrs. She's 30 mins away.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Some of each.  I wish to be competent, confident in my parenting.  I don't wish to have the personal low self-esteem that took her over from time to time, leaving her struggling to be that confident woman who everyone admired.|`|ed766aacc26b258767da06e39783b5fdaa	I love my mother, but like most mothers she has some very wonderful and admirable qualities, and some qualities that are less desirable.  As a parent I am trying my best to learn from her mistakes and not repeat them while raising my child. But I also hope to embody the strengh, compassion, and unconditional love that she showed me.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I am the youngest of 7 children. My parents got divorced when I was three and my dad had nothing to do with us after that for a long time. He was very abusive. My mother did the best that she could with all of us and we all turned out fairly well. While growing up my mom did the best that she knew how. However I wish she would have taught me a lot more. I had to learn a lot of the adult things by myself, like budgeting your finances, balancing a checkbook, those kinds of things. So I now know how to do those things so I will teach my kids. I love my mother but I want to be different. My mother wasn't ever really worried about my education or that involved. I want to be as involved as possible with my kids' education so that they know how important it is.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	NO! lol I wouldnt want to be that nasty old bag if you paid me all the money in the world. I think of what my parents would do and I have done the oposite....its been workin out pretty well for me so far<br>  <br>  <br>  (my mother was a drug addict, did drugs when she was pregnant, drank, most of her kids got taken away and split up in foster care, and she had visitation for me and never used it, i was 4 when i last saw her, got a christmas card 12 years later, and next thing i know she dead)|`|QveBSjFSaa	One of the highest compliments that I have ever received is " You are just like your Mom."<br>  May I be everything to my children that she was to me.|`|pT7jrsAgaa	Yes and no.  I think my mom was/is a wonderful mother.  She sacrificed so much that I never knew about until I became a mother.  I can still talk to her about anything without fear of consequence.  But at the same time, there are things that I hope to handle differently when I face certain situations with my children after they are grown.  I think that's what any good parent really wants...for their children to learn from their mistakes but at the same time, letting their children make their own mistakes to learn from.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	i think there are some things about the way my mother was i definitely have avoided. the big one - really not being into being a mother in general. i'll ask her advice and she'll always say something along the lines of "they'll be grown soon" meaning - that will be a good thing. I don't want them to be grown soon. as much of a pain they can be sometimes, i try to soak it all in because i know it won't last forever. more important than love, i like my kids. when i was little i felt like a pain just because i was a kid.<br>  <br>  on the good side - i could talk to my mother (and still can) about anything. i hope to be like that.|`|2jrffIoWaa	I am pregnant with my first and desperately want to be different than my mom on many levels.<br>  She is very manipulative (to this day) and controlling.  She is negative all of the time and has such a hard time celebrating for me when good things happen.  She gives her opinion especially when she is not asked.  <br>  I just want to be the kind of mom that is supportive and loving, even in tough situations (and in discipline).|`|s4aX6bF6aa	i wish i was as good a mom as my mom was to me...she never complained about anything and did everything she possibly could for us...like me she was a stay at home mom and the house was always spotless, the laundry was always done, she sewed, and she baked...i just wish i had the umph to do everything like she done it.|`|AilIV0oPaa	My mother is not exactly the nicest, she puts to much pressure on us and expects so much. I am 12 and she expects me to be up by 9 in the morning on a weekend. Saturdays are supposed to be my sleep until noon days. LOL. But still I am not a perfect child, I don't do well in school, and I break all the rules. You would have figured she would have done something different.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	I only had mine for the first 7 years of my life, but from what i remember she was the best mother, i would definitely want to be like her.|`|4YIUxSlYaa	Just like.  Because she is the most fantastic mum ever.|`|gxGsqNPPaa	I hope I'll be at least half as good of a mom as my mother was to me.|`|1ERDjrTTaa	I would love to be the grandma she is now to my children, but not the mom she was too me. She is a wonderful mom now, but growing up she had her own problems and just was not really there. She is the most wonderful "grammie" to my kids and a wonderful mother to me now.|`|e1oXiAmwaa	I want to be just like the mother she was and still is!  My mom and I had to work at our relationship, because her mom was not necessarily the best to her.  I am proud to say that today, now that I am an adult & a mom myself, my mom has also become my best friend.
pXSKSS3daa	Most don't recommend more than 4, I believe. Of course it depends on who you are asking and your history.<br>  <br>  As far as the VBAC goes, when was your last C-section? I know sometimes that plays into it. I had Noah via C-section 11(almost 11 and a half) months ago and we're TTC this month. So I hope to have our next by VBAC.<br>  <br>  I've done research on this myself for the same reasons and read that the risk of uterine rupture is relatively low.<br>  <br>  Here is a link I found interesting:<br>  <a href="http://womantowomancbe.wordpress.com/2008/05/15/how-many-times-cesarean/" rel="nofollow">http://womantowomancbe.wordpress.com/200...</a>|`|kaqPSgTVaa	The more C-Sections you have the more likely you are to have another C-Section. If you have many C-Section becomes your only option so what he said was what he meant just in a joking manner.<br>  <br>  You may be able to do a VBAC but you're doctor will give you the best answer. After 2 C-Sections the risks of doing VBAC are greater.|`|VJnmHFR0aa	I'm not sure what it is now, but mum trained as a nurse and when she was doing her training in the eighties it was four.|`|jQDeTTVhaa	I have heard no more than 3 but my mom had 5 kids all c-sctions but after the 5th they burned her tubes|`|jvFWNuiXaa	I have a friend who has 4 kids. all csection. the last one is after her tubes were tied :)|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	Many doctors I know would not suggest having more than 3-4 c sections. As for a vaginal birth after repeated c sections it's risky for the simple fact that you can encounter scar rupture.<br>  <br>  KEY MESSAGES ABOUT VBAC VS. REPEAT CESAREAN SECTION:<br>  <br>  Despite limitations of the best available research, the following conclusions seem clear: <br>  <br>  <br>  Scar giving way: The scar is more likely to give way during a VBAC labor than in a repeat c-section; for most women (exceptions noted below), the added risk of the scar giving way is about 27 in every 10,000 VBAC labors. In other words, nearly 400 women would need to experience the risks involved with repeat c-section to prevent one uterine rupture during a VBAC labor.<br>  <br>  Death of baby: While the scar giving way poses a threat to the baby, the added risk that the baby will die from a problem with the scar during a VBAC labor, compared with women planning repeat c-sections, is about 1.4 in every 10,000 VBAC labors. In other words, over 7100 women would need to experience the risks involved with repeat c-sections to prevent the death of 1 baby due to uterine rupture.<br>   <br>  Hysterectomy in mother: If the scar gives way, some women have a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus). The added risk of needing a hysterectomy from this cause is about 3.4 in every 10,000 VBAC labors, when compared with women planning repeat c-sections. However, considering risk for hysterectomy from all causes, women who plan a VBAC are not more likely to experience an unplanned hysterectomy than women planning repeat c-section.<br>   <br>  Concerns about specific risks: The following factors do not increase risk of the scar giving way during labor:<br>  <br>  type of uterine scar not known <br>  low vertical uterine incision for prior c-section (may have been used if c-section was performed earlier in pregnancy before growth in lower part of the uterus) <br>  baby estimated to be large, and to weigh more than 4,000 grams (8 pounds, 13 ounces) <br>  pregnancy goes past 40 weeks.<br>   <br>  Concerns about other risks: The following factors have not been shown to increase the risk of the scar giving way, but too few cases have been studied to be confident: <br>  twin pregnancy <br>  use of external cephalic version: turning a baby who is positioned buttocks- or feet-first (breech) to head-first position by manipulating the woman's belly<br>  <br>  Infection: Women planning c-sections are more likely to develop infections than women planning VBACs. <br>  Multiple scars in uterus: Accumulating c-section scars increase risk for experiencing a number of serious problems relating to future pregnancies and births. These include: <br>  scar rupture in a subsequent labor <br>  ectopic pregnancy: the embryo develops outside the uterus <br>  placenta previa: the placenta grows over the cervix, the opening to the uterus <br>  placental abruption: the placenta separates from the uterus before the baby is born <br>  placenta accreta the placenta growing abnormally into or even through the uterus.|`|KRQtXHwIaa	I have four kids and 3 were born via c section.  I am not sure on the VBAC some hospitals will allow a vbac, it just depends. I am not sure after two c sections though, you would have to check with them.  My doctor told me I could have as many as I wanted though he recommends stopping at about 5 because the scar tissue builds up and makes each additional surgery last a tiny bit longer and a little bit riskier.  Good luck to you!

9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? An hour and half apart I would wait, they will probably just send you home. Maybe wait until about 15 mins apart if that will make you more comfortable than waiting until 5 mins.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	if u go to hospital now chances are they will send u home if they over an hr apart!!<br>  u should wait till they 5/10 mins apart or u cant cope with the pain|`|X6as2nOAaa	Wait until they are ten then and go up to the hospital and then you can due your epidural mine were 2 mins apart and they did my epidural so they will still be able to do it.|`|P4LBygv2aa	they will give it to you , don't worry , <br>  I had 2 all natural , its not that bad , <br>  make sure you eat something because they give you nothing when your there . <br>  I ate dinner when my water broke, lol , and drank alot of fluids too , them went<br>  my contractions were like 15 minn apart and she was born 8 hours later .|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	They might send you home, if you come up now or tell you to walk around for a while. Their too far apart right now. I had them Sunday about 30 minutes apart and they just stopped after a while, which is why they tell you to wait cause it might not be labor. You won't miss your chance for an epidural.|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	You have a ways to go yet. <br>  general rule is 5 minutes apart, and that is still enough time normally to get an epidural. <br>  Take this time to get some rest. Your going to need it later. This part can take some time to get things regular. <br>  Also, are your bags packed?<br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck!|`|mbvpWNMeaa	Call your doctor's office and let them know that you are in early labor.  Ask them at what point you should come in.  Let them know that you are concerned to make sure that you come in soon enough to get the epidural.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	You won't miss your opportunity for an epidural unless you're dialated too much. Some women can be having contractions that are 5 minutes apart for HOURS but not be dilating that quickly...Others can have a few hard contractions and be at 6cm by the time they reach the hospital doors! So it really just depends on your body weather you're going to miss out on an epidural. <br>  <br>  Also, I don't know how the hospital where you plan on going works, but almost all the hospitals here won't even admit you into labor & delivery until you're 4 cm dilated anyways. So if you go too early, there's a chance they'll send you home. <br>  <br>  Just wait until they get a little closer together.. in the meantime, call your doctor and see what they say you should do for now :)|`|J3yUXKiyaa	You are in very early labour - if you go in now, they'll most likely send you home.<br>  <br>  Yes, wait until they are about 5 mins apart.  You wouldn't be 'too late' for an epidural until you hit about 8 cm of dilation if everything else falls in line and you are able to get one.<br>  <br>  Don't count on getting one for sure - ask, insist...but it's never a guarantee.  Keep that in the back of your mind, and that way it won't be devastating if you just can't get one.<br>  <br>  Get up and move around...walk, do stairs...this is most likely the real thing, but even at 1 day past due, could still be a false start.|`|4USD8peXaa	My sister was having the same thing the other night but mom said it was just when she was dilating. She went back to the doctors on Monday she was dilated 2 cm. The pains should stop but it will start up again every once in awhile. But to be sure I'd go to the doctors or hospital.|`|75HzIpSraa	Oh yeah too far apart now... 5 min is the general rule, unless the pain gets unbearable.  You can get the epidural at any time so don't worry about that!! Best of luck!!|`|oltCj6Kcaa	The hospital won't even keep you with contractions an hour apart. Wait until they are 5 minutes apart.|`|zjeED3YOaa	yeah, go to a hospital!<br>  <br>  you should listen to Ali!|`|JMBT0LSUaa	Wow, go to a hospital anyway!|`|FKQvRZhXaa	why are you on here and not on your way to the hospital?

BRT2teSqaa	Why did you repost this?  You got a lot of answers already, and it's still at the top of the list.  I hate when people do this.|`|q7n8KKlzaa	You are fortunate that the nanny has agreed to stay.  It's completely reasonable for her not to want to be alone with your 11 year old.<br>  <br>  You are right to ground your son.  I'm not sure that 2 months will have the desired effect.  One of the problems with such a long grounding is that if he misbehaves again, even to a lesser extent, you will have to think of another punishment if he's already grounded....Even a week's grounding would help, provided he is stripped of *all* privileges -- TV, phone, Nintendo.  You may also require him to take on additional chores to help out around the house.<br>  <br>  You didn't mention whether or not you have discussed this with the therapist he is currently seeing. Definitely mention this to the therapist and see if she/he has some insight.<br>  <br>  I suspect that with 7 kids at home, that you son could really benefit from some one-on-one time with you and/or your husband.  When the babysitter is at the house, try doing your errands with the older kids, since you really got the babysitter to help with the younger ones anyway. <br>  <br>  If you're really desperate, tell your son that if he continues to act up, you'll be forced to get a babysitter just for him...<br>  <br>  But definitely -- and I know you don't do this anyway -- don't spank or hit him.  I can see all the thumbs down already, but if you hit him, it will justify his use of violence and will not help him.  You son will see you and/or your spouse using violence to achieve an end, and he will think that he can do it too.<br>  <br>  But definitely chat with his therapist about this.|`|dMLLQruOaa	Ok i am currently an Nanny and have worked as a teacher's aide for 8-14 year olds. So this is where my information is coming from.<br>  <br>  *With behavior like this, you have to act fast. Grounding is not enough. If it were just simply saying "dont tough my brother" and not listening to the nanny, then a simple grounding would saffice. But violence at his age is out of control, he knows better and the way he spoke to you is not okay and is pretty out of the ordinary. Your nanny is brave for staying, i wouldnt have. At that age it gets scary as a caregiver knowing if a child gets violent with you that there is nothing you can do. We cannot defend ourselves against a child, especially someone elses child. <br>  <br>  *I have SEVERAL unruly cousins that behaved this way. What my aunts did was first get him in to a diciplinary school such as military school. Not just to be harsh, its not what im trying to tell you to do. But to provide an IMMEDIATE role change, dicipline , and most importantly teamwork. After Military school was over, our cousins were volunteers at after school programs. Nothing makes a child want to listen more than giving them a job that is rewarding, earns them respect, and gives them confidence. Keep following up.<br>  <br>  *And honestly, i feel for your nanny, but i would reccommend finding a nanny whome has worked with a child of his temperament and age group. She shouldnt be in a job that she is afraid, and your son shouldnt get the power of ridding himself of the nanny either. Otherwise  he is going to know that if i hit the nanny, she wont be around me anymore.<br>  <br>  *i do hope i have helped! And good luck!
2b302d308ce4b1da613b5ad7a99843e2aa	I have been on provera for the past few years and never ovulated on it. Provera just makes you shed the lining. I have had to take clomid before in the past. When was your last period? You could be just now ovulating from your last period.

vue9NOhYaa	Older babies tend to be very efficient at the breast.<br>  <br>  A couple of long stretches (4-6 hours) are pretty  usual at this age, and aren't a problem.  I wouldn't let her go more than that however. She needs to be nursing often both for your supply AND to be sure she's getting enough to eat. <br>  <br>  I would offer after 2-3 hours during the day.  If she really doesn't want it, she won't eat.  At night she can go as long as she wants.|`|BUXC2Kz0aa	Your breasts will increase and decrease their milk flow at the same rate that your baby is feeding...babies tend to go thru growth spurts at 2,3,4months where you may find your lil one wil feed every couple of hours...but your breasts will meet those demands!! The more worrying you do about it will cause you more problems!! <br>  The term demand feeding means exactly that..the milk is there on your babies demand as long as you have sucessfully established breastfeeding in the first place which you clearly have!!! :-)  <br>  Just enjoy it hun and stop worrying if she's hungry she will definetely let you know LOL xx<br>  Mummy to AJ  71/2 mths

gJrHBtp1aa	Don't use vaseline, it will dry out her lips even more.

One of the best ways to make sure chapped lips don't happen due to wind is to keep the wind off lips all together*~<br>  <br>  Sometimes a humidifier, to keep the air moist during dry weather, can also help with preventing irritated, chapped lips.<br>  <br>  But the main thing is to keep lips moisturized*~and try to keep the siliva off*~ chap stick or vaseline keep applying it*~ as often as needed*~  Hope she gets better*~! good luck*~!|`|G2auAv1Saa	Make sure you wipe her lips anytime they are wet. My daughter used to get nasty chapped lips and even times around her mouth, but she always licked her lips.

It allows a barrier so they don't get any drier, by keeping elements off and her body to heal them. <br>  It's safe.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Its from the dry air,  alittle petroleum jelly or vaseline should do the trick.  I would recommend putting a little on before naps and bedtime.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	Vaseline should help, I wouldn't advise using anything like lip gloss on a baby's sensitive skin...|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Chap stick doesn't work well for me either. Perhaps,and this may sound completely off the wall,but lip gloss actually helps my lips better. You can just use a dap before she goes out in the cold and if you see her lips starting to look dry.
I6Mu849Daa	It is technically not proven that you can not tan while pregnant. Tanning only tans the outside of your skin not your insides!!! However I do not recommend it just in case something terrible did havppen people would think it was from tanning. Once your baby is here though you will not have to worry about anything and can tan as much as you want. I did however have the spray on tan done just the other day and I am 8 months pregnant and my Dr. said it was perfectly fine. So if you need some color until the baby gets here try that.  :)|`|57c8048751bb6dd1a49dc351791d9b29aa	it should be fine.  as long as you don't use any harsh chemicals on your skin to make you tan faster.  i would think it is just about as bad to do while breastfeeding as it would be going outside for long periods.  and remember, women have worked outside for centuries and had to breastfeed and we are all here!|`|yB5go5wbaa	you'll be fine.  well, regarding breast feeding, but not regarding cancer.|`|0384e9b5fb1fd85ece0382882ee4d5dcaa	It's bad for you (I'm sure you know that already though!! lol) But it's fine to do while breastfeeding. Be careful not to burn your nipples...that hurts like heck when the baby latches on!! (been there, done that!).
hKJIDdVqaa	I am a lecturer also. So if you pushed her this far to get her to ground you, I doubt you will get off the grounding.|`|AA10943329	suck it up. Do the crime then do the time. You have a great mum|`|jSPj3S6faa	The best thing to do is to comply as best and as sincerely as you can.  Most reasonable adults believe in time off for good behavior.<br>  <br>  My real concern is why you are having so much trouble at school.  That is the real question and I would hope that your Mom would understand that; I would hope that the root problem would be addressed.  <br>  <br>  I believe you when you say that you love your Mother.  Try to concentrate on your love for her and perhaps she will feel free enough to look more deeply into your life at school.|`|qQzWECQ2aa	Your mom sounds ridiculous. But it all depends, how many time did you skip school? How many detentions? Just talk to her about it. Bargain, DONT plea. Tell her you love her, and that you promise not to do it again (only if you WONT)<br>  Good luck ^^|`|yazZH4khaa	I think that apologizing will not work, but it is worth a try. Get it together and this will prove to you and her that you are worthy school-wise.

Your mom is trying to keep you from making more bad chioces. If you don't feel the sting you'll go out and do it again. Sorry but you'll thank her later when you get pressured to something you know you shouldn't. Then maybe you'll make the right decision....|`|dM1Ot2APaa	Soften her up before she gets home.<br>  Apologize for whatever it was you did.<br>  Don't yell.<br>  Ask your older sister what you could do.<br>  Don't argue.<br>  Take full responsibility for your actions.<br>  Don't cry(she'll think you're immature)<br>  Tell her how sorry you are and explain what happened.<br>  Don't complain about the punishment.<br>  Tell her you are willing to cooperate with whatever she says.|`|lsSKDZ6haa	you have to prove to her that you can do it, be good in school, try to get good compliments from your teachers, if you already don't ask your mom to go to tutoring, bring home extra work to do, you'll get off early, and if you hang around anyone you shouldn't then stop it, i was hanging around with the wrong group of people and i was getting suspended weekly, once i stopped talking to them, i didn't get in trouble, and haven't gotten in trouble for 4+ months.|`|HtX7YsBvaa	well just do good in school prove her wrong . just do good in school and when she notice that your doing good she mightnot ground you anymore . beside you ****** up big time and its hard for her to get the trust back and your only 13 -____- , thats whyy worst & your still young . just do good , its not that hard , in fact prolly your mom would be happy if you do something nice that you never done with her ? :)|`|mFbPOUWyaa	"I already got punished by the school, why should she punish me again?"<br>  <br>  To make sure you never do it again!<br>  <br>  Apologize, take the punishment she gives you & do really good at home and in school and she'll probably let you off earlier!|`|lwccQoEZaa	If you do the crime then you must be willing to do the time...cowboy up.. 2 months isn't as long as it seems.. it'll pass and life will go on...|`|CTE2eRgZaa	u said it.  you f*cked up.  Now you pay the price.  You're lucky its not longer|`|r0lkpW1caa	ok just like do ur homework dont get into any trouble and completey surprise her when she come home! maybe that will help but other than thta idk.. but i wish u GOOD LUCK!!!!! :)|`|cQb2vqDcaa	Maybe this will the be kick up the backside you need to start acting your age.  Grow up, put up with the punishment, it's only 2 months, your life isn't going to be over before the punishment is lifted.  <br>  You should go apologise to her anyway, and she has every right to punish you, she's your mother.  You should show some respect|`|EZiEb2YAaa	If you cooperate and just take the punishment day by day without arguing with her, she may let you off the hook early. Just don't throw a fit.. surprise her.
DN6XtoViaa	the gene for having fraternal twins is passed on to the daughter from the father. so it sounds like you could very well have that gene for ovulating 2 eggs instead of one!<br>  how exciting! <br>  good luck :)
39qec43kaa	yes, at four months a baby can start having baby cereal either rice or oatmeal.
VbkJ9Tucaa	I like to be cleaned up before my doctors appointments so I usually shave right before or atleast a week before so I'm short down there. If you havent had a pap recently then they will give you one. At my first appointment they took bloodwork to check my hcg levels and all that good stuff. They ask about your symptoms & some family history.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I trim before appointments. Your doctor has seen it all, as long as you wash down there in the morning before your appointment your doctor will be happy. I doubt your doctor cares about the status of your hair.<br>  <br>  One of my friends worked as a waxer for a bit and she saw a ton of pregnant women. She also says it hurts a lot more while pregnant because of the extra blood flow down there.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	I didn't do anything special. They have seen it all and don't really care.|`|9hrJfhIIaa	They check your cervix and external organ of your vagina (labia, inner labia, etc...) for any abnormalities such as STIs - they don't care what your hair situation is. <br>  <br>  I personally shave/trim regularly so it's not a big deal when I have to go for an exam.|`|kT7GVOosaa	I don't and I wouldn't worry about it. once you start to show you cant see it in order to shave it. plus they are doctors for the vagina. they have seen a hairy vagina before. I really doubt anything is new to them anymore.|`|eWObKmBSaa	Please clean before you go, like bathe you know.  That is important.  They are checking for female healthy things.  Fluid goes to the labratory and that is that.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Yeah,usually. But doctor's don't care. I didn't one time,and she didn't say anything or act strange at all.|`|WNn8WDPHaa	well when you get big.. like i amu cant see yoru vagina. so at firs yes later no
Ccq8zEcnaa	It is normal with pregnancy, actually it is called Leukkorhea. Very common and it's your body's way of maintaining chemical balance down there. It's sorta a way of your body preparing for your baby's big debut. I suggest you wear panti-liners to help absorb the extra moisture.|`|Oq2B7I4faa	I know how you feel, I am 36 pregnant now and I still have them, actually it got increased during my pregnancy.  I ask my doctor and she said it is very common.  I normally feel dirty so I wear light days pad.  If you are still concern than you should ask your gyno on your next visit.|`|sqaey2Siaa	Very normal. Get used to this in pregnancy!!|`|cn91FeWcaa	its normal now what u need to do is invest in some pantiliners so that u want ruin all of ur panties........and if u drink orange juice with pulp stop........|`|5ci9IZd2aa	Second Trimester.|`|uuHPneEcaa	it really normal.. IT will stop, probably after u have the baby.. make sure u keep it dry down there cause u don't want it to turn into a yeast infection (while pregnant NOT PRETTY) i had one when I was 21 weeks and I thought I was going to die. and I made sure I keep it clean and dry and still got one.|`|be5076c0b98b495ffe00aade08f96b65aa	Yes it is normal, it's called leukorreah (sp?). It may stop, or it may not. However it should lessen. It's produced excessively when hormones are high. So since your in the 1st trimester, your hormones are at their highest. Then it will taper off somewhat during the 2nd trimester, and peak again somewhere in the 3rd trimester. Just wear a pantyliner. It's nothing to be embarrassed about!
s4LWmcTjaa	You will notice them because your children are two individual unique people, but you will love them just the same.

I would hope as a Mother/ Father you would love your child no matter what!|`|JtbeH1Mgaa	Both of my children are very different from each other but I don't love one more or less than the other because of it.  My children are unique individuals and I love each and every difference about each of them.|`|XTmiI44laa	Well of course you will love them, what kind of question is that.<br>  <br>  I have a son and a daughter, one is all for outdoor sports and one likes to read|`|TQ47vny4aa	What kind of question is that.

lfMJPZ67aa	Hi, what kind of milk is she having? I think she is thirsty. My son is 15 months and give him the breast but it is only to go to sleep now and first thing in the morning as we are weening him off. But I find if he has a full bottle of formula he sleeps all night. My son is going to bed around the same time as your bub, he wakes about 6:30 to 7. I find the formula fills his tummy for much longer so he sleep more sound. May be you could try it, it may help. If she continues to wake up at midnight try sneaking a bottle of formula into her mouth around 11 it couldn't hurt to try. That's all I can think of don't forget she is still a baby and good luck with the sleeping.|`|cd7a815aadd36875b0d7dabeed6e75bfaa	I think it's fantastic that you have a routing, and I think her nap time is spot on. However, I have to be honest and say that I personally think her bedtime is just too late. If you can't change it, then you can't change it, but sleep breeds sleep, and I'm not certain your little one is getting enough at night. <br>  <br>  My son is also 16 months, but he's in bed by 7pm every night, and sleeps through until at least 7am the next morning (I know, I may be lucky and this won't necessarily be the case with all children).<br>  <br>  Even if you can't bring the bed time so far forward, it may help even to bring it forward by half an hour or so. That's all I can suggest hun. Good luck with it!
wENdWT5kaa	You should go back to school and learn how to spell. You don't expect us to believe you are a parent? Do you?|`|2pxiK9waaa	Call the police, or take her there yourself if she's drunk or high. Not only is she underage, but she's also pregnant, so she'd be charged with child endangerment... not to mention the fact that her baby will be born addicted to crack if she continues, and her baby has a high chance of being deformed or have a severe case of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS).|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	okay, your question lost me a bit but if she is 16 and he is 28 then that is illegal. call the cops!|`|fdnbXfvfaa	You should have a gin with her|`|FsFUo4VJaa	call the cops she is 16|`|Tv6mKW1xaa	For 1 who the hell let her move in with her bf of 28 when she is a minor, 2 why would you sit there and let her drink knowing she is underage, 3 why dont you call the cops and confirm her as a run away.<br>  4 she could get in so much trouble with smoking and drinking underage<br>  5 you need to get her bf in jail for satuitory rape. if you dont do this than your are a horriable parent. <br>  How can you let her kill a living child???? if she is really that worried and wants to abort the baby have her do it the right way and more painful way so she will think twice about having sex without protection. Bring her to an abortion clinic if it is really what her mom and you and herself wants. if not make her come home or threaten her with calling the cops and make her carry the child full term( 9 month) and deal with the conquesnces and maybe have her give the baby up for adoption but dont kill an inicent child for her damn mistake!|`|CFFuFof1aa	You sure as h*ll don't need to give her money. AND....she's 16, make her move back in with you. That poor innocent baby!!!! It could be born with withdrawals. You have to tell her mother!! This is ridiculous!!!|`|ImGwbkGNaa	oh the tangled web we weave<br>  #1 why would you give your 16 year old daughter permision to drop out.<br>  <br>  #2 why would you let her date a man twice give her age<br>  <br>  i don't believe in abortion but if she is trying to kill the baby use that 2000 a week your giving her and drive her to a clinic<br>  because her drinking and doing drugs might not kill the baby but it will give the baby birth defects and she sounds like she would be a really unfit mother it will only be harder with a special needs baby
UNWLaJbKaa	Have sex tonight woman!  I used the Clear blue easy fertility monitor which gives you a high, peak, or low.  This month I only BD'd on my first two highs, and my first peak, and we got pregnant.  So def do it tonight.  I still had one more peak, and one more high, but I was to tired to BD'd anymore... and we still got pregnant.  So def do it tonight, and tomorrow.|`|XpLufXKFaa	My husband and I have spent a ton of money on those ovulation tests, and it always confused us more then it helped us, plus, when I spoke to my doctor she worked out through a chart when I would be ovulating. I also found an online ovulation calculator - I think through "baby centre" (I'll find the link) and it was identical to what my doctor told me. Just have sex every other day through the time period that you are ovulating and it will happen, when the time is right.|`|WdvLcYaVaa	You generally ovulate 12-36 hours after getting a positive. I would have sex today tomorrow and the next days to be sure your bases are covered. Just keep in mind though even when you time sex just right you still only have a 25% chance each month for a viable pregnancy. Good luck!|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	I used teh same one and the first day of my last period was Feb 10th too.  I am on a 30 day cycle so I should be ovulating tomorrow, the 26th.  This morning I had 2 very dark lines which indicate that I should be ovulating within the next 36 hours. In January, did you start around the 11th?  If so, then you are also on a 30 day cycle and what you got should be a positive.<br>  <br>  Note: I check mine 2x a day just to make sure that I dont miss my spike.<br>  <br>  You should have sex within 36 hours of getting the positive.  The test checks for spike in LH hormorne which occurs before you ovulate.. so have fun tonight!!!
AA12033653	Walmart carries these.|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	Other than the Gerber diapers at Wal mart, there are no stores around my (in MI) that sell cloth diapers and covers. I ordered mine online. I found some really good prefolds for pretty cheap on Ebay, and I also bought prorap diaper covers. I love them! I also have some of the Gerber vinyl pants from wal mart, but they tend to tear, and wear out pretty quickly. Good Luck!|`|lwWicZCwaa	Buy it from online store.

Qhyovyj8aa	Lol. That's cute. I find that 10 year olds just like having someone to call their boyfriend/girlfriend. Where do they go together? What do they do? Hold hands? Hug?  I don't know, it's just not what I call 'dating'. <br>  <br>  1. No.<br>  2. I was almost 16.|`|43Asle1qaa	1. She is old enough, call me crazy. Seriously, they're not going to get anywhere with it. They are just little kids trying to experiment. Relationships at that age, maybe last, ummm 2 weeks? Not anything serious, and nothing to worry about<br>  2. I was 10 as well, I am 11 now.|`|HcvqGMZraa	1.nope not dating but its okayish to just be like hes my boyfriend and hold hands but that's it.<br>  2.I still haven't started dating but i have a boyfriend but im not allowed to date till i`m 16.|`|hORVMOHKaa	no shes too young i had my first boyfriend in 6th grade lol but we didnt really talk to each other, we just had the label lol|`|5zSAPU52aa	1.yes<br>  2.10 lol im 11 (i dont kiss though i hate kissing)|`|6pEDLnrzaa	no<br>  13 don't need a boyfriend(:|`|IqCkjljkaa	no<br>  I was 16|`|SEzIkGNiaa	1.

Wow, no haha.<br>  2. around 12, i think 7th grade.|`|ojTcrqAOaa	Well it's not actually dating.<br>  Its like..little midget flings or whatever<br>  Lol.<br>  <br>  Mmm, this yr/last yr.|`|8SjoUQmEaa	Well, I think it's okay if 5th graders want to be "boyfriend and girlfriend" as long as it's just being friends with that title, and just seeing each other at school. If they want it to be anything more than that (such as going out on "dates" together) then No, she's too young. My brother is in 4th grade and was "dating" a 5th grade girl, they barely even talked to each other and "broke up" a few days later.|`|N2KmE3rVaa	Yeah i guess shes old enough, sure it will never last but if he makes her happy then let her go 4 it.<br>  And i "went out" with in 2nd grade but i dont think that counts.<br>  So wen i truly started dating people was a couple months after i turned 13.|`|DJpS9GDxaa	1. No waaay....Besides, what can they possibly do? I mean, it's not like they could drive themselves to the movies or something, let alone pay for it!<br>  2. Haven't started. Probably gonna wait till I'm 16 or so.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	i would not consider a 10 year old as dating. they are not going out on dates. they might hold hands in school and talk on the phone but its not like they are going to each others house to hang out.|`|4712f79c3b66a688114af1fc7e707671aa	1. Nope<br>  2. 8th grade, so I was 13 or 14...I think. Lol, I can't remember that far back. XD|`|CWfGCYYTaa	it wont be a proper relationship.<br>  <br>  its like my 3 year old sister who has a "boyfwend"<br>  <br>  i wouldn't worry too much|`|LbNXxRXnaa	No!

239u7iAgaa	Make an appointment with their teachers and work out a solution together. Sounds like a power struggle to me, so far, the kids are winning.<br>  <br>  Remove everything they don't need out of their room. They have not earned the privilege to have toys if they don't do the required work. Be hard. <br>  <br>  Bright children consider (busy)homework a nuisance. Here you have to be creative - the children's teachers will help.|`|26e007e4ed7e7d42044814b364794a0eaa	Hummm.  Mine are still sitting at the table and the reason I am on here and not finally relaxing and watching TV is so I can get up and check every couple of minutes.  They should be in bed.  They make A's and occasional B's but it is a constant fight.  Good luck and I look forward to reading your answers.|`|CrZxYK5raa	i would come up with a homework chart every night they do there homework and you check it they get a star every ten stars they maybe get to stay up a Half an hour later or maybe get an ice cream sunday encourage them to do there homework.|`|2IMF3okYaa	Have a family meeting then talk about it then you can work with them to see if they progress if that doesn't work you have to become strict with them although you many not like it or they might not like it but it will be better for them in life and i also agree with glow that would be a greta encouragement<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|fNv2Re6baa	Set half an hour a night for them to do their homework. If they 'have none', then they can give you a hand with some chores around the house. <br>  <br>  Also, discuss with their teacher. When you pick them up from school, ask the teacher what homework they have. Good Luck!|`|1fjhg6j4aa	Talk to them.  Make sure you put it in terms they can understand, maybe even using examples from life that show them how important it is to tell the truth.|`|ReCh1tCtaa	sit down and talk to them.
wWkfASTNaa	If your period was different at all, ie lighter or for a shorter amount of time, then yes you very well could be. But if it was normal and it was just a little late, then I would say no you are not, because you cannot have a "period" and be pregnant, its hormonally not possible. If you are worried, take a test, that will def clear things up alot!|`|5yAsj29Vaa	When in doubt, test. <br>  Probably not though.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	I had my period with my first child for the first 3 months of pregnancy.<br>  Be worried if the period was unusual. Shorter, spotty etc.<br>  <br>  That is how mine were|`|5SHPRfUgaa	Most likely your not pregnant however there is a slight possibility. I'd say that your not though. Good luck.|`|85V6cHe4aa	No not if you had a normal period and by normal i mean normal length and not lighter than usual,it would be very unlikely.|`|T1LdAIabaa	yep.  Your bleeding could be implantation bleeding.  take a test to make  yourself feel better

At all.<br>  <br>  What about Raven nickname "Rain"?|`|y0e5hG0Saa	Rain isn't one of my favorite names but it is cute. Although I wouldn't go with Raincloud, I think just Rain would be fine.<br>  Here or some other suggestions Willow, Misty, River, Ember, Amber, Coral, or Sonny/Sunny,|`|VBlrL1puaa	If you're going for a hippie/unique or indie type name why don't you go with something such as Skye or something more appropriate and less eccentric.|`|pl7lWGZDaa	Um, if you changed your name to Raincloud, people would think you're crazy.

65f9bf63277a3aad10cb477ed6f41708aa	I started having this also at 12 weeks, it was scary for me. But I googled and looked around and I guess its round ligament pain. Just eveything inside our bodies adjusting and moving around making room for the baby. If your worried give your doctor a call. Good Luck!!|`|9hrJfhIIaa	What kind of weird feelings? cramping? nausea? gas? Are you thinking it might be fetal movement?|`|e3fa2fb97cbca43e2c3086607351d4caaa	u need to be more specific!|`|AA11796548	I don't think you have anything to worry about, I had the same so i went to the doctors and they examined me and all was fine they said it was just my stomach muscles stretching and my uterus growing as everything needs to expand to fit the growing baby and they were right we must expect a few unusual pains when we having a baby growing inside of us so don't stress. Go and see your doctor if that will make you feel better and just to be on the safe side. Hope this helps and gives you abit of relief and congratulations...
5wmrZEQ9aa	We did 1 tbsp of cereal, really thin, lots of pumped milk in it at first, then by the end of the week, it was a little thicker.  She loved it, and gulped it down.  We started with once a day, in the morning, after her first feeding, and then gradually increased to twice a day.<br>  As far as the piercings, I have no idea.  I didn't even know the doctors would do that.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	i have a son so i have no idea about the piercings, sorry<br>  <br>  i started my son on cereal at about 4 months too. i started with 1tbsp of cereal and about 4 tbsp of water and once a day. eventually he started wanting more and started to tolerate thicker mixtures. good luck and get the camera ready!|`|yCwPxulYaa	Well I gave my daughter homemade oatmeal instead of the rice cereal because it is more nutritious and rice made her very constipated.<br>  <br>  I started giving her 1-2 tablespoons once a day at 5 1/2 months old.

4259a8b8fa5899f30c0e319fda9936fdaa	yes!!!  Use gates at the top and bottom of the stairs.  Put outlet covers in all exposed outlets (those little fingers find everything!), and put locks on your cupboards/cabinets....get the kitchen and bathroom cupboards!  I actually left one cupboard without locks, this one has my pots and pans, so they are safe for my daughter to play with.|`|8U4NMYOvaa	yes,yes, yes. make sure you also get a gate for the bathrooms. make sure there are no window blind cords hanging down since babies can get choked in those|`|JtbeH1Mgaa	You should do everything possible to baby proof your home.  The outlet covers, cabinet locks and locks for toilet seats all come in handy.  Here is a website with some more useful tips.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pregnancy.about.com/od/babysafety/a/babyprooftips.htm" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancy.about.com/od/babysafety...</a>|`|ZJDQ1jTkaa	Of course! My friend's baby learned to walk and pulled over an end table. She had to get stitches on the bridge of her nose!! It was so sad..|`|AfjcRXaiaa	definitely baby proof your home to make your child as safe as possible. and use some common sense if it could hurt the baby then fix it.
U3qTwOOIaa	e - numbers are probably driving him crazy|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	hello,<br>  I was one of those ridiculous 17 year old kids who once said to her mum (I am so embarrassed and my cheeks are burning so much, it is hurting my face) "My children will NEVER tantrum like that (pointing to a screaming child".  At 26 I had to carry my starfish shaped, puce toddler from the shops screaming so loud the glass was shattering more times than you've had hot dinners!<br>  <br>  I honestly believed I was the world's worst mother, I tried the super nanny trick, even in the early days a well aimed smack out of desperation, but, that bit me on the bum when he started making himself a martyr "you did smack me!"  and believed he had not earned it in the least.<br>  <br>  Finally, I had to be cruel to be kind, so I would take him to play group, and because he ran off, or misbehaved, I would sit him on my knee and hold him still, saying "you will sit here, until you do as I say, until I say you can move".  He would kick, scream, wail and writhe, for around 2 minutes, then calm down.  I was embarrassed at first, but finally, after a couple of weeks, it worked.  Then I was the one with the well behaved child, who knew he would have to sit and be bored unless he played my way.<br>  <br>  I know exactly what you are going through, all that stuff about the road etc, I swear you could be talking about my son.  Don't be afraid to turn around if he is really creating, have a pact with your older daughter, tell her you are training him to behave, and if you have to take him home so he does not get his visit to the park or play group or whatever, she can either stay up late or have a treat to compensate.  Then get down and say "because you did ...." we are NOT going to playgroup, grab his hand or the reins, and drag him home.  Don't argue, interact or anything.  Put him in the house, and if he kicks up a stink, put him safely in a room or space where he can't get out, repeat by saying "because you screamed at me you will go in here until I say you can come out"  always get a sorry from him.<br>  <br>  Your daughter is obviously well behaved, so somewhere in you, you know he will come out of it and that eventually, he will stop making you cringe.  It's hard work I know, but you are doing so well, so be strong, show him who's boss, and you will be amazed.<br>  <br>  It is embarrassment aplenty at first, but I stuck to it, and my starfish child can now be taken anywhere!!|`|qjf1BoNIaa	It's funny you feel that way. Have you been paying attention to all the other meltdowns going on around you? You are definately not alone. Some kids are just more high strung than others and they tantrum more. Make sure he is getting plenty of sleep, reduce his sugar intake and give him warm soothing Lavender scented baths (Johnson & Johnson baby wash) when he is wound up. Take him outside to play alot. Don't worry, this too shall pass. He is normal, just different.|`|LxRHLR2laa	My daughter is exactly the same and she is almost 3!! She was about a year and a half when she started mini tantrums but it was easy to calm her then. Now if she wants something in a shop or is having fun and doesnt want to stop she lets me know about it and sometimes I just don't bother taking her places. <br>  <br>  In public it is hard because you think everyone is watching and judging but they arent. I saw a mother go round the supermarket with a little boy having an absolute screaming fit. If it was me I would have left or given in but she just bravely ignored him. He went on for a good 20 mins but then stopped. I overheard other people in the store saying how she has done the right thing.<br>  <br>  I think next time I will follow her example but it is still a stressful time. They grow up really quickly and in 20 years tantrums will just be memories. Probably fond ones...
Z5g7hCXraa	You sound really worried.  Take a deep breath.<br>  If you are providing nourishing food for him, and plenty of liquids, he'll be okay.  I had a really skinny baby, as in ugly skinny, and my doctor said that as long as he was eating and drinking, peeing and pooping, and doing the right developmental stuff for his age, he was fine, and he is a big, chunky boy now at 10 years.<br>  <br>  Don't worry so much.  But, putting butter in his food isn't nourishing him.  While you shouldn't be feeding a toddler low-fat foods, there is no need to add fat to his food.  Give him lots of only nutritious food, as close to its natural state as possible so that he's not filling up on junk like fast food and prepackaged snacks.|`|AA10120592	I have this recipe for muffins made with baby food..the veggies. They are sweet enough that kids will eat them, but also have loads of veggies. You may want to take him to his doc, and get a referral for a pediatric nutritionist, my sis had to do that for my nephew that had a very hard time putting weight on. <br>  <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/Kid-Friendly-Veggie-Muffins-128256" rel="nofollow">http://www.recipezaar.com/Kid-Friendly-V...</a> here are the muffins if you want to give them a try.|`|uAhpXUoLaa	I think that it is perfectly normal for your baby to be small. As long as you have taken him to the doctor and they don't say anything about his weight being low I would just leave it alone. My son is 3 and only weighs 26 lbs. He has been to the doctor and they never say anything about his weight. He is a picky eater but he eats when he wants to he is just such an active kid. He never sits down:) I really wouldn't worry too much about it until the doctor thinks that it has become an issue. Hope this helps.|`|vEv2YwWdaa	First you need to bring him to the doctor to see where he fits in the precentile of most kids.  If he is hungry he will eat, you should not be trying to give him something to make him hungry.  Babies burn a lot of calories when crawling or walking around.  If your doctor feels he needs to gain weight he will let you know what you can do to put some weight on him.  Do not take it upon yourself to "fatten" him up.  You may e doing more bad then good.
sxecXFgraa	My kids are 7 and 10.  I started talking them to my GP last year.  I find it easier for my family if we are all at the same office and the GP does the same thing for my kids that their pediatrician did.|`|BRT2teSqaa	Sometimes kids go throughout childhood/adolescence, and even early adulthood, so 21 isn't unheard of.  Usually about 16, is when they stop going to someone who just specializes in pediatrics.|`|6ITgXvBWaa	I had to stop going to my pediatrician once I graduated high school at 18 years old. That was only a few months ago. <br>  <br>  It depends on your health clinic and insurance a lot of the times.|`|a8IRxC4raa	Depends on the doc.  Ours sees kids until they graduate college.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|7aCH91ISaa	My 17 year old still sees his pediatrician. She is a great Doctor and has treated him since birth. <br>  <br>  I saw a pediatric urologist until I was 21. Then I had to be a grown up and find a grown up urologist. I was heartbroken because he had been my doctor since I was born and ranked one of the best in the country.|`|518069c6671837d3e99efe674b52d88daa	i didn't stop going to my pediatrician until i was 18. it was kinda sad- people thought i was a mom bringing my own child.  but i liked her.|`|s4aX6bF6aa	i think once you turn 18 and graduate from high school you should start going to a regular family physician...just my opinion though.|`|CFFuFof1aa	Once the child turns 18, he should find an adult doctor.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Just asked my ped's nurse the other day.  She said that our ped usually stops seeing kids at 18, but he is willing to bend that rule, if parents ask, to continue to see them through their college years.|`|AA10494763	i was like 17 the last time i went to mine.  I got a "big people" doctor after that. <br>  My last visit was to update my tetnus shots and something else before going to college.
obN6p3Cgaa	Are you stress? that can cause it Good Luck.............|`|3CxtflUsaa	Any kind of change or stress can alter your cycle. <br>  <br>  Did you lose weight? Have you been exercising more or less? Could you be pregnant? Worried? On any medication or drugs? <br>  <br>  The only way to be sure you're okay is to see a DR.
rDPADat1aa	I'd have to agree with one of the other posters.  Go check out some sites that already have them made and study the pictures.  That'll give you an idea of how to make them yourself.<br>  <br>  I made a diaper cake that was three tiers myself.  It turned out really well and the mother I gave it to loved it.  If it were me, I would roll and tape each onesie so it was a long cylinder and then arrange them with one in the middle and then enough around the center one to make a circle like the shape of a cupcake.  Then I would wrap thick ribbon around the outside and tie it in a bow.  You can also try raising the center one and working outward to make the domed top.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  That sounds like an adorable idea!<br>  <br>  ETA:  Okay, I just googled it myself ( <a href="http://www.bamababiesandbirthdays.com/baby-onesie-cupcakes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bamababiesandbirthdays.com/ba...</a> ) and found what you mean.  I'm sorry, I misunderstood.  I would get some onesies with cute prints in the center and then fold in the outer fabric with the snaps and tags, etc. to make a ball and then tape it.  Place the onesie in the cupcake paper, then put a bunch of them in a donut box.  You could likely get one at the grocery store or a craft store.  Good luck with your project!|`|3CVfUiiJaa	I have searched the web and all I come up with is places to buy already made ones.  Sorry...maybe you can do that?  Just search on google and you'll see lots of pre-made ones.  :)|`|AiJeS6I1aa	I'm hoping that you don't expect people to eat baby clothes for dessert!<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Just trying to be funny.  Yeesh!  Thumbs-down to you too.
971d3daea9af9b7b15f437ab3cfcc861aa	Tell her to not worry about giving one more attention than the others.  First of all, they will be too little to know the difference.  Infants don't have jealous feelings.  She will give attention to each child as he or she needs it.  Make sure she gets plenty of rest - every time the babies are sleeping, she needs to try to take a nap or at least take a breather!  Try to help her out as much as possible - even if it's as simple as bringing her a meal one evening or running to the store for her to pick up some diapers or tidying up her livingroom.  She'll appreciate it.<br>  Tell her congratulations!|`|OZ474DMYaa	tell her to stay calm and gets lots of people to help. trust me she will need help.|`|iMaTMWMxaa	I know I didn't have 3 at the same time, but I have 3 under 3 years.

Ask him about the magazine don't accuse him of being gay or having a secret girlfriend.<br>  <br>  And if you have a issue with him being gay since you have pushed that out of being a option with the magazine let him speak to someone who can help  like a therapist to help him... NOT someone who says they want to cure him!|`|ZZztSumhaa	I would just spill the beans too him. I mean you already know, just say you dont mind about the girl but you dont want him having sex. Or unprotected sex.|`|o3OgDcfeaa	i think your son might be gay and not have a secret girl friend..maybe you should talk to him and ask him who's the magazine belongs to and why hes been so secretive..good luck!!|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	talk to him about safe sex. if he wants to do it, he will. just make sure he knows how to be safe.|`|vdhU2IWhaa	Be honest and ask him.

8XjJzj7Naa	For me, I tried taking everything that my diet lacked and I got pregnant.<br>  <br>  First and foremost, I used an ovulation predictor kit!<br>  I got my positive reading on my 11 day, so we had sex every day starting from day 11 until day 16.<br>  I started to take my prenatal vitamins beforehand<br>  I took iron supplements 2 per day<br>  I took Robitussin (regular brand) to thin out my cervical mucus.<br>  I also tired a different position during sex, which has proven to work.<br>  I stayed stress free!<br>  I drank plenty of water (which was a first for me!)<br>  <br>  && BAM!! I was pregnant, after 16months of trying just a few minor adjustments and I was pregnant! Good Luck, hope all works out!|`|savIDjYyaa	Keep track of your cycles<br>  Chart BBT<br>  Do OPK's<br>  The most important thing is that you are sure when you ovulate and you plan sex around that.  I'd just have sex every other day starting on day 10 and then you should be covered.. and when it happens.. it happens... lots of baby dust|`|DCwGQDO9aa	Yep, get an ovaluation test.<br>  <br>  I tried to get pregnant for 4 months, and got a test one month to track my ovaluation and BINGO, I have a 6 month old daughter now.|`|Npy1kswWaa	Try fertility blend and have a lot of fun don't stress to much.|`|3pIBqvWMaa	if ur periods are regular!! its 14-16 days before ur period is due is when ur most fertile it worked for me and my friend...do lots of baby dancing around that time good luck|`|obN6p3Cgaa	Sex every other day when you are fertile you can use ovulation kit i wish you Luck******

oGfxATzXaa	its not very likely. its hard to get pregnant from pre-*** without being on birth control. but with her being on the pill and you finishing with a condom and pulling out. . i would tell her not to worry about it. the chance that shes pregnant right now is very very low. the way shes stressing about it she might even be late with her period and that will just freak you guys out more, so tell her to calm down lol.
t0jC2o0Jaa	It's possible. Go to your doctor to get checked out.<br>  Or, it could be because your period was late, it makes it pour.<br>  I've had periods that were late and the blood just builds up and then when it comes, it comes as a waterfall. Good Luck.|`|7cjqT33Baa	It's definitely possible and happens so often that women just assume it's a heavier-than-normal period and don't even know they were pregnant unless they have a blood test done.<br>  When an early miscarriage happened to me, I tested positive on a Friday on three different tests (and brands) and then by Sunday I wasn't testing positive anymore.  Monday I started a my period and it was really heavy and I had intense cramps.  The blood test showed I had a miscarriage.<br>  If that just happened, you can still have a blood test done and then you'd know for sure.

obN6p3Cgaa	Report it lost you can get it back.....|`|yKS2UI87aa	PCAP is availabe in the United States, it's basically Medicaid but you are only on it until you give birth. The baby may qualify after for Medicaid depending on income. They treat you like a second class citizen when you have Medicaid though. I found out I was pregnant and had to be on it til my work was able to sign me up for regular medical  insurance.|`|HztriBPAaa	There are lots of programs to help low income families with medical issues. You can try applying for medicaid in your state or I would suggest calling 211. 211 is a national social service helpline that is like 411 but free. The counselors have access to a database of programs in your state that can help you.|`|HWRk31Fjaa	The only thing I could say is that if you cannot afford to pay doctor's bills, get a midwife and have the baby at home.|`|RhHv5pYwaa	You have to google and pu in some of those key words. Free health care, pregnancy help. Call some local clinics and ask them if they can recommend a clinic or program
VBlrL1puaa	In california, im pretty sure the whole U.S., its illegal to pay for a baby. Thats selling it. There may be adoption fees and medical bills, but thats when you go through an agency and contracts are signed and its a legitimate process, this sounds rather sketchy and i would go get an adoption lawyer to draw up legal papers. You will then be protecting yourself and your future baby.|`|w3ob12X6aa	i had a friend do that , she carried the baby the whole time and then gave the baby to a lady that couldnt have children and the lady paid for like everything all doctor visits anything she wanted to make sure that the baby would have everything he/she needed, in the end she came out paying a lot of money i dont know the number off hand but i know it was pretty expensive, good luck|`|CgEQAgXhaa	You will have court/lawyer fees and whatever your 'friend' wants from you.  A lot of people get into situations and have to pay for everything to living expenses and cell phone bills for the birth mother.  Have a talk with your friend about what she expects financially for you.  Also keep in mind that she has the entire time shes pregnant to change her mind and, depending on the state in which you live, 6 months or more to change her mind after she has relinquished custody of the baby to you.|`|6W9joRbVaa	However much she's willing to sell the baby to you for. Going rate on craigslist is anywhere from 3 buckets of KFC (including a side of mashed potatoes and corn) to $10,000 and anything in between
DDYwnut6aa	Not necessarily.  You're not looking for a particular temperature, it's the pattern of the chart.  If your temperature stays elevated past the time your period is due, then you should test.  My typical post-ovulation temp ranges from 98.1 to 98.9.   Haven't conceived yet!  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you!
QwPpLgX7aa	You might be pregnant or you might want to be pregnant so bad that you have convinced your body to "act pregnant". We tried for over six months before I got pregnant.  I always felt like I was having all the signs too, but always was disappointed.  When I finally got pregnant I just knew.  It was really weird.  Just take care of yourself just in case.  I took my test the day after my missed period and it came back pregnant.  Good luck and keep trying.  Don't get discouraged.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It's far too soon to take a test. The earliest you can test is 5 days before your expected period but MOST women don't get positives until the day their period was due. Its' pretty early for pregnancy symptoms. Hold off and wait to see what happens.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Its really too early to be having alot of symptoms of pregnancy. Right before my missed period I had pms like symptoms and ended up pregnant, so thats possible. but I would just wait and see if you get your next period and then take a test to find out for sure. Also, if you have been trying to conceive for over a year and a half now, I would maybe recommend going in to see a fertility specialist to make sure nothing is going on with your or your fiancee. good luck to you. Lots of baby dust!|`|ZJDQ1jTkaa	It doesn't matter if it's too early to take the test. Take one anyway then talk to a doctor about the results.
IFDfpbFJaa	If you are pregnant then you are eligible for medicaid. Every woman in the united states is entitled to prenatal care. They just might not cover anything other than pregnancy problems.|`|5WP9rLTlaa	Oh for crying out loud!<br>  American answerers- She's in Australia- It's called medicare here, medicaid is an American system that is not available to her because she does not live in America!<br>  <br>  Medicare is the government health safety net so that people who do not have private health cover can still access basic medical treatment, you should have applied for a medicare card as soon as you reached adulthood so that your medical history is put on the public record. The only people not eligible for medicare are those on an exorbitant annual income- if i rememer correctly you have to be earning well over $100000 per annum to be ineligable.<br>  Just take in copies of your last couple of pay slips and your redundancy notice and you won't have a problem.<br>  And swallow your pride and apply to Centrelink ASAP!|`|rjVALevtaa	If your household income is low, then yes. You'll need to bring proof of income for whoever lives in your household. They won't care that you aren't working, they just want the household's income.<br>  <br>  If no one in your household is employed then just go ahead and tell them so. You can't prove income that you don't have.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	you can not get medicare because that is for the elderly|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Possibly. Go and apply.|`|HztriBPAaa	You can get medicaid not medicare. You may also qualify for state aid. To prove income bring your bank statement and if you are getting unemployment then bring the last few check stubs. If you got laid off and didn't quit you should be eligible for unemployment so if you are not receiving it go ahead and apply. Also you will need to submit proof of income for anyone living in the home with you.|`|dMLLQruOaa	You cant find a job because this economy is really killing us. Your not alone. You should be able to get it. Just bring your last pay stubs, i would also bring a utility bill if you can in case they want to prove your residency. If your partner/husband is involved his pay counts as income as well so if he is helping you can bring in his proof of income. Just tell them you are in between jobs, let them know you got laid off. They should be used to hearing this, its happening everywhere.|`|JxPw8OaHaa	You are applying for medicaid not medicare and should have no problem with getting it.  I dont know what state your from but here in NY being pregnant and unemployed qualifies you for assistance.  Continue to find suitable employment but until then you should be able to receive assistance.  Good Luck|`|98d8c3e3328b57d9fa0c7f9c021e8603aa	i don't know about medicare but you can get medicaid.|`|CFFuFof1aa	You can get Medicaid, not Medicare. Call your local Department of Human Resources.|`|crb7bDpjaa	It's called Public aid or medicaid. Not Medicare! Contact your states unemloyment agency to get help. Or google search your state with the words Public aid. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|yKS2UI87aa	Proof of income would be your unemployment check stubs. There is PCAP (prenatal care for women) good luck!!!!

EyKJ737daa	Any discolourations sweetie and I would be calling the doctor or hospital where you will be giving birth.  Discoloured discharge is usually a sign of infection.  Probably best to get it checked by a professional sweetie, just in case, always best to be safe than sorry.  All the very best and good luck for the big event!|`|62vCoDPjaa	call your doctor or triage nurse at the er... it may be leaking but atleast someone can give you advice over the phone or tell you to go in to get checked...green sounds like the baby may have passed a stool inside you and that you are leaking fluid|`|7c9a6ac2b60c434d81159b0728373573aa	That's not your water it's probably your mucus plug I'd call my doc because if that is what it is your water wont be too far behind.|`|1o820L3Daa	You should call your doctor now, or go to the hospital.|`|nfLyS1toaa	sounds like baby poo in your water you need to call your dr.|`|de2a2663fe4b3d02deeeda407aee1db1aa	Greenish???

Delivery now is safe!|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	if it were green that would mean that your baby has had a bowel movement. usually it's clear water like and you can't tell except by moisture. for me it felt like i was peeing my pants
cfdooGylaa	Normal fetal heartrate is usually between 120 and 160 bpm. So its a little under, nothing dramatic. If you feel movement then I dont think its something to worry about. Is the baby measuring good? If yes then I highly doubt weight gain has any correlation to this. In the future, if you ever feel uncomfortable in a situation like this, always ask your doctor questions until you are satisfied and get the answer you want. Your doctor knows better than us. Good luck.|`|62vCoDPjaa	if its something that has been a constant in your pregnancy with low heart rate then i wouldnt worry.  if they felt you werent gaining enough weight they would tell you.|`|98WKYtfwaa	If i were you, i would call your doctor up and ask him if you should be worried about this, what effects it can have and so on. If not, then get a 2nd opinion.<br>  <br>  I always thought a babys heart rate should be between 110 - 180 beats per minute, if not then it can be something to worry about. <br>  <br>  Yours is over that, so i wouldn't be worried about that i would be more worried about what the doc said about your baby moving.|`|OJFz0LBZaa	The heartbeat is usually pretty fast when the baby is small and slows down when it gets bigger. You will also notice variations in the heartbeat rate depending on whether the baby is active (fast) or sleeping (slow) when the rate is taken. they class anything under 90 to be to low so i wouldn't worry to much|`|WZhTCA4faa	well its not that serious because the baby is moving so i guess its ok i wouldnt be too worried about it|`|ODIpb6X1aa	If the docotr's not worried, you shouldnt be.
RzaP9bQmaa	I know what you mean, my son has had them and still uses them.  <br>  When he first started to drink from Tommee Tippee I found out that the teat would screw up almost collapse on itself. I soon realised this was because my son was sucking to hard on the teat that it would do this.  I think its part of the design to stop babies gulping too much air, helping to reduce wind and colic. <br>  <br>  My son is now eight months old. and still uses Tippee's.|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	sounds like they are sucking to hard, i always use to make the holes slightly bigger got on much better then|`|cd7a815aadd36875b0d7dabeed6e75bfaa	I don't know why, but some of the Tommee Tippee teats have a valve (to stop it creating a vacuum) and some don't. Check yours as it sounds like they don't have the valve to allow air in while your daughter drinks. If it doesn't, you may need to go back to the shops and get some that do have the valve. It's pretty easy to see, even through the packaging.
tkqV2CI5aa	ha ha, this happens to me sometimes, i want to slap them in there face, but listen, if you tell her what's up and tell her she doesn't have to nitpick at everything you say just to be an ***, see what she says, or if you really want to make her mad, just over talk her with something else like she is wrong, let her know how it feels, don't be scared or they will run aaaall over you!|`|qjf1BoNIaa	I usually avoid those people at all cost. They just upset me so why be around them. If people don't ask why you aren't joining in just tell them you are sick of being nit picked and if people would grow up and "seek to understand" you might put yourself out there.|`|kMCe7IZlaa	..dude why is this in the toddler section. lol<br>  <br>  prove her wrong, OR say F*** YOU! IM RIGHT, B*TCH!<br>  :D|`|AfjcRXaiaa	tell her get in her face and really let her know that she has ticked you off. maybe then she will back off and shut up. if that don't work then slap her.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	Just ignore her.

5ci9IZd2aa	It's different for every women. I conceived around the end of May and new something was off at the very beginning of July so about 5 to 6 weeks. I wasn't nauseous, the missed period wasn't even a factor, because of irregular cycle, but the clue I got was my breast  were painful and  my Aureoles were much darker and covered a larger area. I was tired a lot like you are, and just a general feeling of something not explainable. I hope this helps.|`|3sGkmzOYaa	Take a test|`|khJYKSUraa	6 months|`|6ebc3QuFaa	Before you begin to get prepared, you need to know first if you are already pregnant. Most women use as an early sign of pregnancy as the first missing period when this symptom could be associated to other disorders sometimes or metabolism adjusting to increasing needs or hormonal changes. Some women can even have menstrual periods clear up to the six month of pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Some other symptoms of early pregnancy help women to know they are pregnant as well as home pregnancy test to find out, but other signs let you guess it in advance. Morning sickness and sudden fatigue may be the first manifestations of pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Your body increases the level of the hormone progesterone as it adapts to pregnancy, which makes you feel tired. This is a temporary condition that usually passes away during the second trimester of pregnancy with intermittent episodes coming back on the third.<br>  <br>  Another sign that may be observed is in your breast, becoming more tender, swollen and sensitive because the increasing levels of hormones during this stage making you feel discomfort until during the first trimester while your body adjusts to pregnancy hormonal changes.<br>  <br>  Other symptoms include nausea or vomiting, food aversions, increased sensitivity to odors, frequent urination, higher body temperature than usual and of course the missed period.<br>  <br>  If you do not keep track of your menstrual cycle, or it is irregular, varying from one month to another, these signs will help you out if your symptoms are associated with upcoming motherhood.|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	have you missed your period yet? if so, take a hpt<br>  <br>  i started having symptoms around 5 wks (tired, breast soreness)<br>  i didnt feel sick until about 10 wks<br>  <br>  however, i have a friend that had morning sickness from day 1 all the way til the end. so it varies with everyone. just take a test :)|`|dYa5AEwSaa	until 3 month|`|ujGq2YcHaa	Sounds like you may be pregnant.  If you already have symptoms like morning sickness, you may test positive on a pregnancy test.  If not, wait a week and try again.
Q08p7jYGaa	Women can have their period while pregnant. I know from experience. So Id wait until after your period and then maybe test. Me, both of my sisters and my mom had periods while we were pregnant. And my ob says that there are a lot of women who get thier period while pregnant.
6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	My 5 year old daughter is currently in prekindergarten (because he birthday is after the cut off date) and she is full time.  But that would depend on the school in which the child attends.  The prekindergarten is like regular school, meaning it starts the same time and ends the same time.  She goes Monday thur Friday.  But you will need to check with the school because they are not all the same.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	My son was in pre-k and it was monday through thursday from 8:00 a.m. ti 11:30 a.m. They didn't have school on Fridays.
AA11022786	If the baby (or previous baby) was a boy I'd get him some season tickets to the sport of his choice...or at least 2 tickets (one for him and son). IF they are girls I would get some professional pics done of mommy, daughter #1 and bump for his office. Guys are suckers for good pictures of 'his girls'. If he's an outdoors kind of guy she could also get him some gear for him and matching for the kids. If he's going to be in the hospital with her a lot then maybe a PSP to help kill time? <br>  <br>  It really depends on him and his tastes. For my hubby I got him a really nice camera so that he could be in charge of capturing the moment of our second. (Our first didn't make it) And for our next one I'm going to get matching soccer outfits for him, our one year old daughter and a onesie!|`|20f8b1c68faad972184ca3e9654670bdaa	PShahahahahaha!<br>  "Isn't that enough?"<br>  <br>  hahahahha,,,yes, more than enough.<br>  Get him a bottle of bourbon, he'll be needing plenty of these by the 2nd 3rd 4th 5th years of that circus!<br>  <br>  <br>  Isn't that enough HA!|`|DHf3aqPAaa	Cigars to put in the box!!|`|IWinNj2saa	She's already giving him a gift, a child she carried for 9 months.

Zb7CtLxbaa	Yeah, why not? You said yourself there is supervision and everything. Just make sure she knows what she's getting into. There may be something embarrassing she did or said that she won't remember, but as long as she has a good sense of humor and isn't sensitive, she should have fun!|`|AA10325228	I personally wouldn't let her, she might embarrass herself in front of the whole school. Plus I heard of some stories were kids and teens don't wake up from hypnosis and they have to stay in the hospital for a long time (happened to 5 girls at a high school near my hometown)|`|a8IRxC4raa	Go ahead and allow it.<br>  <br>  Hypnosis is just a form of concentration.  A hypnotist cannot make your daughter do anything illegal or immoral.  <br>  <br>  My child participated in one of these shows when she was ten, and she had a great time.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	if its a school sponsored  activity, it is perfectly safe. they wouldnt risk a lawsuit or harming a student. if it werent safe they wouldnt allow it, i say let her do it if she wants to.|`|AA12145826	Oh what's the harm in it? Its not like every time she hears the word "rutabaga" she's going to cluck like a chicken for the rest of her life (but that would be kind of funny....*giggles* ah-hem sorry).<br>  <br>  Like you said, I'm not even sure "entertainment" hypnosis works and this sounds like its going to be all in good fun. Can you volunteer too?|`|cGnIZ7kfaa	Let her. I WISH I went to your daughters school, I WANT to get hypnotized!<br>  It would be a wonderful experience. Can she askl for a specific hypnosis? I would ask for me to be hypnoed to stop biting my nails.<br>  I think she would be very happy to go. Let her, or shell watch miserably as other students take the floor and she just sits there.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Shure, why not...there is only a certain percentage of people that can be hypnotized anywase...if she is in that percentage, well then it will end your skepticism! :) It's not going to hurt her in any way to try!|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	Yes, your daughter will just be hypnotized to do things like.. pretend you're driving, pretend you smell something delicious, pretend you're shakira. its all in good fun.|`|x1tEBx2jaa	sure. i guess so.|`|wqrycWlEaa	Don't worry<br>  She'll be fine|`|AA10804824	Do it, it's fine & fun!|`|8yTP3jO8aa	Well, if you aren't even sure that hypnosis even works, why are you concerned about it?<br>  <br>  Also, for what it's worth, the hypnotist is only picking about 15 of the entire crowd, so her chances of being picked are pretty slim, too.<br>  <br>  We had a similar event at school when I was in high school.  The hypnotist used the same program every year, so it started to get really predictable, but he was really good and very safe.  His program during the day was very educational and focused on emphasizing the safety precautions he was taking and how hypnosis wasn't a  game.|`|CS1J8Kpaaa	Hypnotism actually does work, but sometimes depending on who's performing, it is scripted just to trick the audience. The hypnotist going to your daughter's school might be a real one, if not they'll be told before the show. <br>  <br>  It's 100% safe, but hypnotism is real.|`|ePcNVX10aa	I don't know.. being a mother to a teenage boy I would think that there may be certain things that might come up that she might not want to let other people know or hear, things that she might not even be aware of that could be embarrassing. It might cause problems for her in school. It is difficult enough being a teenager these days.  I guess... if she is prepared to deal with the consequences.|`|iDZXVfbbaa	Why not? let your daughter have some fun and something cool to remember about. If something wrong happens (which I don't think it will) you can suit the school lol no, but don't worry, everything is going to be fine. I'm sure he's going to tell her to act because I dont believe in those things.|`|xVEqBjDVaa	Whatt?? What kind of...event at a school is that? Lol. <br>   How long does it even last if it works, and can anything happen from it? Ehhh....i mean i guess you could consider it but i would check into it and see if its totally harmless or not. Eh..|`|IwQa2zkEaa	This happened at my school. It was a lot of fun, and no one was harmed emotionally or physically in any way.<br>  <br>  Go ahead and let her do it.|`|IE1LvgD9aa	Sure it might be fun!|`|rBq189W1aa	Why not? Sounds like a bit of harmless fun. I'd be happy to let my kids do it.|`|wlaEnkc9aa	Sure|`|4Qb1FNH2aa	Honestly what is the big deal? If she wants to do it, than you should let her.|`|7ydnDQl2aa	Why not?|`|zkdIn09qaa	if you now it's safe why not|`|cAtWxJG1aa	lol, i'm sure it's totally fine.   but i have to tell you i swear i used to be a great reader with a great memory.  in college i went to this hypnotist thing  (just for fun) where he allegedly hypnotized all of us and told us we'd slow down our reading but recall more of what we read.  i'm telling you i'm certain that that was the day starting on which i continued to read at the exact same pace but started forgetting it all .....|`|TQW5E6olaa	Remember the guy that galloped off the stage thinking he was a horse? That was pretty recent. Only reason I can think of not to...
ASH6fsmoaa	Mine started sharing when they were 2 and nearly 1 (they are 3 and 4 now.) It works well for bed time but never worked for naps for us. The 2 year old was ready to give up her naps by that time so she would not let the baby sleep. I ended up putting her in the spare bedroom for nap time (with lots of books to look at) Now neither of them nap but they still have quiet time, one of them in their room and one in the spare bedroom. Because they don't nap they are usually so ready to sleep by bed time that there isn't a problem with them falling asleep. Occasionally they will lie and chat for a short time (actually very sweet to listen to!) I love that they have each other for company and I'm sure it helps them sleep better. It may take some time to figure out how it will work for you but I'm sure it will!|`|4c94e705496562941dadbdc5a4680c31aa	When my girls were 1 and 3 I had to put the 3 year old down to bed first or she would wake her sister up, now they go to bed at the same time with no problems except for the occasional talk til you drop gab fest they put on. It just takes time to figure out the right thing for your little ones. Good Luck.|`|JtbeH1Mgaa	My 3 & 4 year old are in the same bedroom but I keep them on the same schedule.  They both go to bed at about 10 pm and get up at 9 am.  Then they both take an hour nap so they get the recommended 12 hours of sleep.  We do have two bedrooms though so if they decide to argue, fight or try and get up to play with toys, we will put one of them in the extra bedroom.|`|KL3pgYIYaa	Well for me when they were younge it was fine because they got along great and they would play together, but then when they got oldder around 7 and 9 things started to become and issue.  My youngest would take my olddest clothes and they would fight all they time. So then me and my husband dicided to buy a drape to go inbetween the two beds for when they are changing and want some privase and then there dressers and things are on there side of the room.  It works great and the kids don't fight as much at least not about there rooms anymore.
XsmPnMU4aa	Yeah they could get more but they would need a bigger belly. Maybe a robotic belly would work.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	8 is pretty much the limit and even that is very dangerous.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	Maybe 8 isn't the max, but I seriously doubt that there will ever be many more than that at one time. <br>  The reason is this.. look at how small a set of octuplets are when they're born... Now, try to imagine squeezing even ONE more baby in there! I don't think it would work out. The mother would either miscarry several of the embryo's past a certain point, or very few of them would make it after they were born because they'd just be too damn small.
I64JOuMKaa	LOL<br>  my friend did that to my other friend today but she didn't know him.<br>  <br>  sammy: *walks up to Travis and stands next to him<br>  travis: *stares at sammy<br>  travis: uh ...<br>  sammy: OMG YOUR ASIAN ! :D<br>  me: sorry, i'll take her away before she embarasses herself even more<br>  me: pushes sammy away* lets goooooooo<br>  sammy: TRAVIS ! I LOVE YOU , DON'T EVER FORGET ME! ITS LIKE THE TITANIC I'LL ALWAYS BE THERE FOR YOU <br>  <br>  LOL, i love her she's hilarious<br>  <br>  and you don't meet new people unless you talk to them right?<br>  I talk to random people sometimes : ) that how i met most of my friends :D its fun ! LOL|`|J3H3C5ksaa	Er. You see, I do that.<br>  <br>  But more random.<br>  <br>  Example: My sister, in her grade there's this guy who's ethnicity she couldn't find out. I saw him with my friends once, I ran up to him, our convo goes like;<br>  "Are you Jake?" [me]<br>  "Uh, yeah?" [him]<br>  "Ohh, okay, good. Now, what race are you?"<br>  "What?!"<br>  "You know, I'm Asian, and you are?"<br>  "Uh..."<br>  *silence*<br>  "Well?"<br>  "Filipino?"<br>  " 'kay thanks, bye!"<br>  <br>  EDIT::<br>  <br>  Burple, LMFAO! xDD<br>  <br>  Lolz, as a dare once, someone dared me to go up to a little girl and start talking to her, she was creeped.<br>  "HEYYY!" [me]<br>  *stares* [her]<br>  "Don't you remember me?!" [me]<br>  *shakes head* [her]<br>  "Oh. Okay, bye!!" [me]<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Other time with librarian.<br>  "Excuse me?" [me]<br>  "Yes?"<br>  "Do you have the latest Dora book?"<br>  "Uh..yeah, is it for your siblings?"<br>  "NO. I'm a huge fan!"<br>  *stares at me*<br>  "FINE THEN. I'll just go away now."|`|6eaWRGaqaa	I would feel happy if someone randomly started talking to me! They just are trying to be nice and want to make conversation.<br>  <br>  In my school it is very small and there are 60 girls per grade. I know everyone and have been friends with everyone at some point. We all get around relatively okay so it's not really "random" when someone sits next to you and starts talking.<br>  <br>  The only way to find out who's rude and who's nice is by talking to them! Next year I may be going to a public school and I'm totally excited! I really want to know what it's like!<br>  <br>  Sometimes we make fun of this one alumna who is now a teacher and make her feel awkward<br>  <br>  Me: Hey buddy!<br>  Latin teacher: yes catherine? Do you want to know your homework tonight or something?<br>  Me: wow! ur like psychic! i wish i cud be a mind reader<br>  Latin teacher: yah I know, but people without minds can't read them<br>  Bunch of friends: ouch diss!!<br>  Me: OH. MY. PINEAPPLES! did u just call me dumb?<br>  Latin teacher: did you just talk back to me?<br>  <br>  haha it was hilarious at the time.. luhh her. not really, but still.. she's like 22 years old so she's a child @ heart hehe<br>  <br>  -Catherine|`|oKwXjVolaa	Sometimes I mind it, it depends who it is and what I'm doing. If I'm sitting there doing nothing and it's someone I'm sorta friends with, then I have no problem with it. But if I'm in the middle of something, I'd rather not start a conversation with them.|`|539aSIVtaa	its nice, im shy wen im by myself, so i dont necessarily talk to anyone, if someone decided to talk to me i would try my best to start an interesting conversation. lol!|`|LSkeAPBIaa	Unless something is wrong with that person I'm cool with it. I always have to be talking to someone|`|H0sPCJQPaa	Nope, I am a chatty and nice person. I will talk to anybody :)|`|PTK2x59Kaa	I don't care at all at school, bc there are only <br>  60 kids and most of us have been going their together<br>   since pre school so it's neve rreally that weird, of corse<br>   there are some kids where it's unexpected, but it's still <br>  not that weird and i don't get annoyed or anyhting.<br>  <br>  However if it's lke somewhere other than school, where <br>  i haven't known the person since i wsa like three I <br>  think I'd be sorta of annoyed and very WTFish.<br>  So in your school just do that with the nice people.<br>  -Jakelin|`|7nOkNtw4aa	I like it, because it usually means you have done something or look interesting enough to talk to.<br>  So it makes me feel pretty happy. :D.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|aDQgLEbuaa	Sometimes it's awkward, but most times you can get a nice, little conversation out of it.  I just talk back, I don't get annoyed or mad.|`|9XjtEdEqaa	i like when people i never talk to start to talk to me. it usually starts new friendships. i usually dont start conversations with new people but maybe i should.|`|05XVCQR3aa	I like it when people randomly talk to me except when it's during a test or something. I like getting to know people better and it's a good way to make friends.|`|CdJtH0xdaa	That happened to me a lot in high school, and sometimes it was annoying, but I usually liked it, because they were so friendly.|`|AA10673927	I usually don't get annoyed unless I'm thinking about or doing something else. I like to talk, haha.<br>  <br>  [:|`|EyE0yoSkaa	I like it because im a really shy person, so if someone doesn't start a convo. with me i'll just stay quiet the whole time.|`|wqRwSaGSaa	i randomly talk to people.<br>  i like to make friends :)|`|Jucak0HLaa	Not really.I go to school in a small town,so most people there you have known since you were a baby.|`|Rs3ITS1Iaa	i would be flattered since not many people talk to me.|`|pcjOQDymaa	nope cause i randomly talk to people to.<br>  if i like you i start talking to you and most of time i become friends with that person.<br>  but if i don't like that person than i try to ignore them as nicely as i can. :D|`|2ktp7dEUaa	Depends who it is, but usually I like it because I'm super shy and it helps to get a conversation started. =]|`|Nnqw6AU3aa	If they're nice, I don't mind :)|`|2QvIM81Haa	I would love it! I think it shows them to be outgoing and fun!
ecLVTXKUaa	My brother and I shared a room when we were little.  6 year apart...  was that way for several years until house was remodeled.  It was great.  We were very close and played together very well.  Half of the room was boy stuff and mine was girly... I have to say his was the messy side :)     But it works out fine... make do with what you have as long as the family is happy.|`|h90Uobyyaa	I had to share a room with my 2 brothers for a few years when we were kids but then got my own room when i was about 12 or older. I didnt see an issue with it at all. But i did prefer my privacy when i was a teenager. Other than that i used my room to sleep thats it so didnt really bother me if it was shared or not.|`|n1vKoto7aa	My 5 yr old son and 11 month old daughter share a room because we currently only have two bedrooms. They're so young that I don't even consider it an issue. For older children (BOTH over the age of 7, I'd say) I think brothers should be with brothers and sisters should be with sisters.|`|IPl3Yh1kaa	I did not share a room with my brother, I did with my sister. However, if all we could afford was to have all 3 of us share a room that is what we would've done until my mother ( I was raised by my mom) could afford something else. <br>  <br>  We were living in a house that we were renting when I was younger. The roof unfortunately collapsed and we had to move into our grandparents place so my mother could save up for a place to buy. While we were living there my sis and I shared a room, and my little brother stayed in the same room as my mom. No harm, no foul. She was doing the best she could. Fast forward about 2 years and we got a house where my bro had his own room. That was nearly 15 years ago.<br>  <br>  You are doing the best you can, there is nothing wrong with them sharing a room for a bit. Good luck :-)|`|2F5HNPqPaa	My brother was 2 years younger than me and we shared until we were about 8 and 6.  As there is such an age difference, I don't think it will be an issue as (hopefully) your daughter will "look after" your son, rather than fight and argue like children close in age might!
I64JOuMKaa	I actually used to babysit a lot<br>  but nowadays since there are so many<br>  creepo's out there its hard for families to trust you<br>  so I don't really babysit anymore<br>  <br>  But I used to get about maybe a family a week ? maybe more if I was lucky : ) but usually I would babysit for family because it was easier because they knew they could trust me : )|`|M9yIVcSYaa	I babysit allot.  I babysat two 3-month olds boys (they aren't twins) and a 2 year old boy on Friday.  Then Friday evening until Saturday morning I babysat a two year old girl. I babysat her again Saturday night until Sunday morning.  I babysit almost every weekend.|`|3GhDbVVYaa	wayyy to much, its like not even funny i cant hang out with friends on fri. nights b.c i always have to bbysit :P but the money is good on the other hand and need it right now so i guess i have to chose one or the other|`|oKwXjVolaa	I only babysit when my parents are having a party and their friends pay me to watch their kids around the pool and in the yard etc while they enjoy their party without having to worry about kids running around.|`|LSkeAPBIaa	I have 6 younger siblings I babysit every day  after school.

I probably get other offers once a month or so, but I usually can't do them.  I babysat about two months ago, and I'm babysitting again this sunday for someone else.  So, if not for the same family, a couple times a year, maybe like 7ish.|`|yOhGkcNjaa	it depends. I babysit more in the summer.

RPd66ldYaa	First, You sound like such a great person and the family sounds wonderful. In a world with so many problems and disgruntled people - you have really found yourself in a good situation, and you're doing a job you love. I am happy for you! Sorry for ranting on about that! About your question - I would just 1. Tell your mom and ask her about watching the child during your maternity leave 2. After the little girl's birthday party, maybe a few days later or even the day after you could tell them about you being pregnant and about your mom watching during the maternity leave time<br>  <br>  I think you sound like you're really close to the family and they will be happy for you. :)|`|wOLoYW7jaa	I would just let them know a few day ahead of when you want to talk to them that you need to sit down with them both and ask for a time that suits them best...you dont want to do it at a time when they are busy or have something else on their mind.  It sounds like they will be happy for you and will give their daughter a playmate as well
PNMxbktAaa	I've always liked the name Rudolf. I think it would be really cute if it didn't remind people of the reindeer. I actually have a friend with the name Rudolf (but he doesn't go by that name, because people would make fun of it).|`|S3vYMNzFaa	Hm.  I'm not a lover of either, but they are interesting.  Rudolf is a little too reindeer, and Rolf is a little too piano-playing dog.  Hm hm hm.  I'll go with Rolf, for some reason!|`|2TrHH0rkaa	Rudolf, has more history behind it.|`|zwJaIDFeaa	Rolf|`|vgQBoU4Uaa	Rudolf|`|ZJVNUmz3aa	Rolf -- easier to pronounce and less embarrassing. haha. just my opinion though.|`|mfRH2Wiiaa	SRY, but neither. if i had to pick though Rolf, the other one I think of the reindeer.|`|CxRJwJsraa	hmm...I think I prefer Rudolf.
01Mu3wUeaa	lol, he's so cute!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  I know my son went HYSTERICAL over the simplest things and still doesl.Must be nice to be a baby and so easily amused :)|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	Lol, very cute. My son does that with his little ankle socks. He will pull them off his feet and do just what your son is doing in the video. It's pretty cute how a sock (or bootie) can be so entertaining.<br>  <br>  Edit: Also, I don't know if that is a purse in your avatar picture, but my son seems to love playing with and chewing on purse straps as well.|`|OwLcbnTvaa	Awww what a cutie.<br>  No my son never did that,come to think of it, he does anytime he sees the cat, he goes all crazy and really high pitched voice going taa taa, and puts his forehead on the cat haha. hes nearly 1 yr.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	When my son gets like this I call it his "OMG LOL LOL" mood.  It can be anything that sets it off, if he's in that place.|`|Kbz8XEf9aa	You have the cutuest most happeiest baby lol, he is exploring his surrondings and having fun. It really seems to amuse him haha, who needs all these expensive toys when you just need a sock lol|`|f8b0aaad8207d631cdc448f606b81a58aa	OMG! That is sooooo cute! He obviously is a happy little boy! My daughter would get spurts of energy like that, but never about booties! LOL!|`|qyM4mTWDaa	I dont kno about ALL babies but i sure do know about my own... I LOVEED to see when he did this...... its amazing how that he is older he dont do it but he does other fun stuff (12mos and counting)|`|h90Uobyyaa	haha yes! My son does this with any toy. He LOVES his nappies and goes crazy flopping them around (the clean not used ones).|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	OH MY GOSH he is SO DARN CUTE!! My brother was exactly the same when he was a baby hehe.|`|pXSKSS3daa	He's such a sweet little guy!<br>  <br>  You're definitely not alone in this. Noah is 11 months old and gets giddy around balloons and balls. He starts flapping his little arms and makes a "EHHH" sound over and over. It's funny to watch, that's for sure!
TE7foNwMaa	Don't worry, I love Jon and Kate plus 8... :) I really love their kids' names, but I suppose I'm too concerned about the popularity, you know?<br>  <br>  ? Remi / Remy -- dare I say it... Ratatouille. What can I say, I'm in love. I've never heard of This Lullaby...is it good? I'm in need of a new book... I'm a big fan of reading right before I go to bed. :)<br>  <br>  ? Violetta -- My cousins had a friend named Violetta... I met her over the summer, and I absolutely love her and her name...even if I can never pronounce her last name right (Zdanovskaya).<br>  <br>  ? Korie -- It's not exactly my "favorite", but I do absolutely love it. It's from the book "God's Smuggler". She's Andrew Van der Bijl's wife. I have to say, I thought she was pretty cool. :) Though, I have absolutely no idea how "Korie" is spelled in the book...we listen to it on tape for sunday school, and just "hear" it, but never see it. Plus, he kind of sounds like he's saying "Kari" (car-ee, not care-ee) instead of Korie (however it's spelled), but our teacher always calls her Korie (again, sp?)<br>  <br>  ? Kestrel -- I adore the bird. I did an extra credit on this bird a while back, and actually found it extremely interesting (and oh so colorful), and actually thought "Kestrel" might just be an okay name... I know, it's odd... I suppose I won't use it...my sister hates it. She is constantly telling her that she'll only be able to picture the word "castrate" which isn't such a great thing...<br>  <br>  ? Lael -- This is 100% my absolute favorite name. It's pronounced lay-el... I don't tell people it much, though... Possibly because it's strange, or because I don't want it to be stolen... I'm not sure. But she was actually another one of my cousin's friends. I met her also over the summer. She's another absolutely amazing person, and I love her name. She's brilliant.<br>  <br>  ? Melodie -- This is partially because I'm a huge fan of music, and also a huge fan of the Little Mermaid... I know, dorky. I like the "ie" spelling rather than the "y" because it's the French version. I recently found out that I'm actually quite a bit French, and I'm partial to French names because my sister's learning the language. So, yes, it looks classically misspelled, but I love it this way. <br>  <br>  ? Katriel -- Can be pronounced kay-tree-el or kat-tree-el. I haven't decided which one I prefer... It's slightly after my cousin, Kaitlyn. It's so much easier for me to find names after her...but I can't seem to find one after my other cousin, Melissa, that I really like. So I have an extreme list of middle names after her in secret ways... :)<br>  <br>  ? Jillian -- again...dare I say it.. A mix between the Bachelor and the Biggest Loser. They're about the only TV shows that I watch (well, no more Bachelor...but the Biggest Loser is amazing, in my opinion). I'm usually not much of a fan of TV, but I have my favorites. :)<br>  <br>  ? Josephine / Noemi (no-eh-mee) / Capucine (cap-yoo-seen) / Salome (sahl-oh-may) / Severine (say-vuh-reen) -- Heh, I know, quite the chain. I discovered them somewhere on a blog about French names. Well, actually, my sister found it.... I don't know how, I haven't been able to track it down since then... But I wrote down my favorites (being the ones listed above). I'm definitely quite partial to French names lately... I love them. <br>  <br>  ? Sabine -- This is horrible. You'll never believe this one... When I was little, I used to play the video game Spyro the Dragon... On one game, he had to find eggs of other baby dragons and...save them? I guess. And, one of these baby dragons was named Sabine. My sister and I used to list each one, and claim certain ones as our own. Sabine was one of my firsts... I know, sad, huh? I genuinely LOVE the name though...Spyro just introduced me to it. :)<br>  <br>  ? Bentley -- Oh drat, you'll never believe me for this one either... So when I was little, I used to play this video game...get the idea? Yeah, there was a Yeti on there named Bentley, and my sister would always make me play the part when you had to be him... What can I say, that Yeti rocks... And I love the name...kind of because it reminds me of my last name (Bailey, but Bailey's too popular....)<br>  <br>  ? Jasey / undecided on the spelling (Jacey?) -- It's the name of one of my best friends, Jacey. I kind of stole her sweatpants today for track practice because I left mine at home... She's amazing, she's always really energetic but knows what to say to make you laugh or just cheer you up. She's pretty fun. I actually used to like this name (and Jase for a boy) before I met her, and she turned that "like" of a name into "love". :) Jase on the other hand, is now one that I could never use. When I went to public school (8th grade, second semester), I met the boy named Jase at our school... Oh my, he's absolutely crazy. He's kind of one of the extreme perverts that thrives on making sick-minded jokes. He's horrible. He dropped out this year, actually...<br>  <br>  <br>  I suppose that's enough for now. I like your "Christopher" reason. :) I used to make up stories about how I had a little sister named Bijou (which I don't, I'm the youngest in my family, but I always wanted a little sister). So I actually adore the name Bijou, also. Really love it... but most people don't. <br>  <br>  This was an amazing question, I really liked it. Sorry for the rambling....again....<br>  <br>  -- Amy|`|Wnmg850Paa	My daughters name : Veronica Juliet<br>          Veronica from the movie "Heathers" Veronica Sawyer played by Winona Ryder, my fav movie when I was a kid..<br>  <br>           Juliet" from Romeo & Juliet" one of my favorite stories of all time.

AA10598531	acctually, i am pro choice(even though i was raised catholic). a lot of people hate me for this, but in some situations it's the best choice<br>  <br>  my friend got pregnant at 13 from being raped, and it ruined her life, she got kicked out of school(our school doesn't allow it), and her home because she wanted to keep it. So she lived on the streets and she got abused by some people and lost the baby anyway. her life is still going downhill and she didnt deserve that|`|wnkoTEqVaa	I am pro choice. I have to say that some of it may be true but alot of it is imbellished.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also it is not a baby until it can live outside of the womb which is about 6 1/2 months until the pregnancy. <br>  <br>  It is a womens choice what she wants to do with her body.<br>  <br>  romanian princess. Abortions has been legal since ROE VS WADE. <br>  <br>  John B is back!    just imagine the emotional trauma one the women giving birth to her rapist's baby. THe women was raped and the she now is responsible for a child whos father raped her. <br>  <br>  ?Allie<3Ryan aka my oxygen? Obama already won the election. <br>  John B if i found out that my father raped my mother i would want to get aborted. If i was born i would probably kill my rapist father and kill myself. Put that in your Jesus loving republican pipe and smoke it you narrow minded bastard. Your kids do not need you to survive first. Also it is a womens body she can do what she want.   we are not talking about kids who are born AND CAN LIVE OUT SIDE THE WOMB we are talking about a clump of cells that have no feelings and is a  fetus an will not become a child UNTIL IT CAN LIVE OUTSIDE OF THE WOMB. A child can live out side of the home. I actually think your the one who is evil for bringing up murdering your already born children. <br>  ABORTION IS NOT MURDER.|`|FGZR9RwDaa	wow to the person who said vote obama for murder,<br>  i love obama but i am pro-life. so yeah.|`|tBtOTiQDaa	bovine feces<br>  so just because you where raped, its okay to kill someone, someone who had nothing at all to do with it<br>  bovine feces<br>  every one deserves a chance at life<br>  i agree with you 8>%<br>  <br>  prepare to be bombarded by murderers, my pro-life friends<br>  the last days are here<br>  when people call murder "just", and "good"<br>  and martyr faithful people, well<br>  if you care about life, give us all a thumb up<br>  <br>  @cyrus <br>  so because the women was raped the baby has to die<br>  yeah, perfect sense<br>  you wouldn't say that if your mom was raped, and you where aborted<br>  well, you wouldn't say anything, and maybe less babies would die, and the world would be a better place<br>  so if its a "womans choice" then why can't i kill my child (hypothetically)<br>  after all, its as much a part of my body as a baby is of a womens body<br>  yes, babies need a woman to survive, my kids need me to survive<br>  once again, good triumphs over evil<br>  EDIT<br>  continuing that anology, until a child can survive outside my home, i can kill it<br>  i feel sorry for you, really<br>  i'll be praying for you, i hope you turn from your evil ways<br>  i don't care about thumbs down<br>  For the weapons of our warfare are not those of the world. Instead, they have the power of God to demolish fortresses. We tear down arguments<br>  ~ 2 corinthians 10:4<br>  i think you're evil for supporting the murder of children|`|KH9HROrSaa	i am pro choice. i personally believe that the government doesn't have a right to take away a women's right to do what she wants to do with her body. if you want an abortion, you should be able to get one. The reality is, if abortion isn't legal, people will find ways to abort their babies which isn't safe. They need to have a safe option.<br>  i'm not saying you should abuse abortion, practice safe sex, or abstinence.|`|vp1K0bxwaa	NOPE! Sorry, I'm pro-choice, and we can have our own websites out there, Lord knows there are enough pro-life websites spewing lies out there.<br>  <br>  There are ENOUGH children in the foster care/adoption system, and a LOT live in horrid homes, wouldn't it be easier to end their pain before they can actually FEEL it?|`|clc6qQDAaa	I couldnt ever have an abortion.<br>  I couldnt murder my own child i think any one that does is sick in the head. You cant kill a baby for thr careless mistakes you make.<br>  How can any one live with the guilt?|`|clFTA9fDaa	That article is freaking dumb...<br>  Like really.<br>  Obviously keeping the baby is a better choice morally, but it's an individual's right to do what they want. I think it's ridiculous to force someone to have a baby.<br>  I agree with the fact that if you're not responsible to have a baby, you shouldn't have sex but that's not reality..<br>  And if someone's raped or if the baby would end up killing the mother I think it would make me a HORRIBLE person to tell them they have to carry the baby to term and have it. After being raped, how can you expect someone to feel a child growing in them for 9 months that is a product of one of the worst things in their life?<br>  Everyone should worry about themselves, it's not up to us to judge people. And if you do, you're no better than the person you're casting stones at. You 'religion" should teach you that.<br>  <br>  Thumbs down?<br>  Wow. You can't have it both ways guys, if abortion is wrong because the bible says so, then you are also as bad as the person who had the abortion because to god sin is sin. There's no distinguishing factor.<br>  I would never have an abortion, but don't dare tell me I don't have the right to have one.<br>  Obama protects the rights of women, something you should be greatful for.|`|uYDoPNv9aa	i know how you feel!<br>  i agree no baby should have to die for the mothers mistake or just because the mother isnt prepared for the baby. the baby has no voice what so ever! abortion really needs to stop!!!!!!! now since obama got elected one of the first things he did is signed the abortion law so now everywhere abortions are totally legal! thats one reason why i didnt want obama to be president cuz hes for abortions. but yeah i agree obaortions are totally wrong!!! ABORTIONS IS MURDER!!|`|cj29AORfaa	i'm against it too. I mean if somebody has unprotected sex and gets pregnant, it's not the baby's fault. It's the 'parents'. Put the kid up for adoption if you can't/don't want to keep it. There's million of people who want kids but can't have them for one reason or another.|`|AA10480735	I totally agree. If the mother is unprepared, let her at least give the baby to a loving couple who can take care of it. No baby should have to die because of one "mistake" the mother makes.|`|rOfFOcwpaa	I've seen better websites.
VKgD1K3baa	Absolutely!!!! My hubby brought a cold home a few weeks ago and I of course got it! I was sick for 5 days, however my baby was only sick for 1 (barely). Your antibodies are passed through your milk and will help protect you son from getting sick or help him fight it so it doesn't last as long. I was so happy he wasn't miserable along with me! :) Best of luck to you!|`|kprKXEOSaa	Your body produces antibodies every time you get sick or are exposed to sickness, and those antibodies are passed on to your baby through the breastmilk.  So, yes, it's not only safe, but a great way to help to keep your baby from getting sick.  You might just lay off all the kissing and try not to sneeze or cough on him.<br>  Congratulations on your new arrival!|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	you can still breastfeed u just have to keep ur fluid intake up|`|1CEApjyRaa	Yes it is safe. I had the same concern. The doctor told me anything I've been exposed to he's already been exposed to and even if you catch a cold your breast milk is still healthier and will give him more immunity than formula.|`|0bX3uZ3Baa	it is safe to breastfeed and will keep him from getting the cold too. breastfeeding gives antibodies to all kinds of illnesses. keep nursing. it's best for your little bundle of joy.|`|siDcjgJCaa	It is probably best to continue to breastfeed as much as possible. Breast milk will give him lots of nutrients to help fight any kind of cold he might be exposed to...|`|oojO4WAraa	Yes.  Your breastmilk will help give him immunity.|`|PeoOb4aHaa	If you have a cold in your house, don't switch to formula now!  Your milk is full of immune factors.  Formula is based on cow's milk, and the immune factors that survive processing are cow-specific and are based on what your cow was exposed to on her farm.  Breastfeeding fights illness.<br>  <br>  Personally, we're all sick right now, but my baby is far less miserable than I am.|`|ZnXyIQKlaa	Yes!!!!  There are not a lot of times that it's not okay to breastfeed.  My son is 4 months old and I have nursed through a leg infection which required 2 antibiotics and a virus, which both my husband and I had but my son only had 3 loose stools which for a bf baby is not even considered diarreah.  Way to go, keep breastfeeding!!!  It's the best thing you can do for your son!|`|OBU1eDUHaa	I have breastfed both my children while I was sick.  I'm not sure that they can get it from breast milk.  I think you get it by contact (so make sure you are practicing good hand washing and lysol stuff like door handles/phones/etc) or airborne.  There's not much you can do to avoid that other then wearing a mask.  Good luck!|`|D8vOpNWgaa	your best bet is to keep on breastfeeding the lil guy. your anti bodies will get to him via the breast milk and he should be fine. you on the other hand plenty of water, oj and rest you will need it. you should still be washing your hands before nursing him or using hand sanitizer.|`|g6GApb67aa	He will take the antibodies you are making to fight off your cold and more than likely not get sick. Go Breastfeeding!|`|sRjURY43aa	Yes. Keep breast-feeding. It will help him fight it off.|`|4WJM3j9Aaa	no..formula feed..do you want your baby to get sick and get rsv
HoonZJMgaa	Your belly may be small or it may be huge. Don't worry you will be beautiful either way.|`|plI0WOrUaa	It honestly really depends.  People show at different times.  I am pretty tiny like you, and i started showing around 18weeks.  But other girls i know are just as tiny and started showing much later, and some earlier.  Its hard to predict really.  I would just choose a style that isn't super form fitting in the waist.  Like no corset style or anything.  You will need some room for sure by then.  What about an empire waist style??  That would look really cute.  Good luck|`|bGRexKPyaa	Well you should barley start showing around 4 1/2 to 5 months. But unless you eat ALOT then you wont fit into your dress. Your only gaining a few pounds right now..<br>  <br>  Eat lots of protein foods like chicken breasts (not deep fried) LOTS of water!!!!!<br>  <br>  Of and from here on out lots of PURE viatmin E oil every where,(boobs, butt, thighs, top of calfs, love handles and tummy)<br>  <br>  Good luck mamas!!! & CONGRATSSS|`|tkqV2CI5aa	I gained 10 pounds before my 20 weeks and i did weigh 125.6 pnds, you don't start really getting a big bump till 3 months or so.

At 20weeks i was a good bit bigger, not massive though, i could still fit into my size 8 clothing (uk size). I had alot of bloating too though, so i did look noticably pregnant most of the time.<br>  <br>  After 20weeks, i just started getting bigger and bigger, i'm now 24weeks and look like a planet.<br>  <br>  EDIT - I looked exactly how the girl above did at 16weeks.|`|d5fd9d057a20f9f41b37d39a5288a98faa	Well, I am not 20 weeks yet, but I am 15 weeks and I was about your size before I conceived.

281bc9a14a2a3c5832ce389a1258dda1aa	My son is 5 and still takes naps not everyday now though. In the state I live in they are still offered until midyear in kindergarten. When he was 2 if he didn't have a nap we would all be crazy by 5 pm!! Different children are different though. He just got to where on weekends he doesn't want to nap anymore but I do make him go the bed about an hour earlier so he is not exhausted. <br>  <br>  If you and he still like them there is no reason to stop them now :)|`|68cc82283542fb9e45877505681f26ffaa	My son stopped taking naps right before his 2nd birthday. He used to take 3 hour naps during the day and go to bed at 7pm, he woke up around 9am..<br>  <br>  Now he goes to bed at 6pm and wakes up at 7am.<br>  <br>  I think every child will be different, some children still take naps at 5 and 6 years old.|`|Ge8xMTgRaa	My daughter is going to be 4 in April and she still naps. Of course, I put her to bed and she doesn`t like it too much, but at the end she caves and has her hr and a half or two hr nap. Her bed time is at 8pm and she goes to sleep just fine. She just knows the routine.<br>  Probably your son will go to bed sooner if he stops taking his naps, but I would advice you to continue this way, because it helps them rest.|`|RPd66ldYaa	My son stopped napping around 2 1/3 or 3 yrs old. He goes to sleep around 9 pm and wakes up around 7 or 8 am. :)|`|KL3pgYIYaa	they stopped there naps when they were 4 and went to bed at 7- 8 and woke up at 7 - 8 ish
b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	if you are asking when can you stop sterilizing the bottles, it means that you can :).. a parent of a newborn will do sterilization religiously - but once the baby is a bit older, than by all means you can stop.. there are other reasons for that as well - at around 6 months of age, the baby has to start being exposed to the real world with all of its germs - that's how the immunity is built up.. as for the water, i suggest you keep it boiled or at least bottled since a baby's body might not be ready for unfiltered water|`|deIzFnV8aa	Everything I have read (including the directions on the bottle pkg) say to sterilize them in boiling water for 5 minutes before first use, and then to wash with hot, soapy water or in the dishwasher (which can reach near-sterilization temps).  I just wash with hot soapy water now and feel totally comforatable that the bottles are clean enough.|`|VXhOLgDEaa	hmm....my daughter is 10 mths..and I still sterilize her bottles. It's not much of an inconvenience for me.....its kind of automatic and not troublesome so I never thought about not sterilizing her bottles. But I guess I could stop because I handwash with dish soap all of her spoons, sippy cups, and bowls and etc. I don't know why I never thought about stopping the sterilizing...but its pretty routine for me...and so I guess I'll stop in two mths when she's off the bottle altogether.|`|GNLYxY7kaa	i stopped boiling my sons bottles at 6 months. now we just wash in hot water with soap or run through the dish washer...he is completely fine!|`|8WNwHBAuaa	They recommend sterilising till baby is 1 years of age. This is to stop a bacteria which attaches itself to milk, which can make a baby ill, as they dont develop the ability to fight it till after their 1st year. I know people say 'baby eats stuff off the floor', but its not the same thing. You can stop using boiled water at 6 months. If you wish to stop swterilising before the 1st birthday, just make sure you wash bottles properly, ideally in dishwasher or very hot water. Just dont leave any left over milk to fester in the bottle. i hope this helps.|`|VJnmHFR0aa	Really you should sterilise the bottles up until one year, bacteria breeds so quickly in milk.  Babies don't have the immune system to deal with it until they reach a year.  <br>  <br>  Ultimately it's your choice.  I did it right up to twelve months as I felt that if she became ill because I didn't bother to sterilise I'd never be able to forgive myself.|`|8Cvv86Jeaa	You can actually stop sterilizing baby bottled after the first time you do it. They say do it once a week until they are 6 months. But if you wash them on the top rack of the dishwasher it will do it for you. Hope I helped!|`|nN2pIykfaa	when your baby is playing on the floor and able to pick stuff up to put in his/her mouth and when you are using plates, bowls and spoons etc for feeding, there's not much point sterilising bottles any more.|`|gHyu4Hqaaa	aat about 6 months but some say longer|`|X6as2nOAaa	You only need to sterilize the first time that you use them then you can just wash them regularly|`|Wn0nwNFjaa	6 months is the rule of thumb although it took me sometime longer (just paranoid) before I have up sterilising the teats.
bcZSIphUaa	I have mild PCOS.<br>  <br>  My PCOS diagnosis was made after ultrasound which showed multiple ovarian cysts and blood test which showed slightly elevated testosterone. I also haven't had regular periods since stopping the birth control pill 6 months ago.<br>  <br>  First step in fertility treatment was Metformin. I've attached some info about it below. It's become a pretty standard for PCOS women TTC. It can really help us to have normal periods, ovulate and thus conceive!<br>  <br>  I've been on Metformin (still am) for a few months. The next step for me is Clomid - which is a treatment to get me to ovulate. It involves taking tablets for 5 days.<br>  <br>  The important thing is that you get an ultrasound to confirm the PCOS diagnosis. You should also be tested for insulin resistance and glucose tollerance - because a lot of PCOS women have pre-diabetes. I don't which is lucky. IT's interesting that Metformin is a drug used for pre-diabetes people - yet for some reason it also helps PCOS women without pre-diabetes restore fertility!<br>  <br>  Anyway, all the best. Make sure that you're seeing a obgyn or reproductive endocrinologist that is specialised in PCOS - so that you are getting the best care.|`|yp9rEMSraa	Okay it depends on what your doctor thinks....If he thinks that you will still have normal periods if he takes you off the BCP then he will....He might just take you off and give it a trial run to see if your periods return to every two weeks or not....Clomid is good for when you dont ovulate from what i am understand....Are you ovulating?  Another thing your doctor can put you on is provera to help with your periods....I would tell your doctor you are ready to start TTC and see what he says and thinks.......Dont be nervous just think of it as one step closer to have that beautiful baby you are wanting....Best of luck!!|`|TcgUE0WYaa	I have mild PCOS and have had clomid for the last 4 cycles. It has made my lining thicker and my cycles a little more regular. The last course (150mg) worked and we conceived but unfortunately I am having a miscarriage. I feel confident about clomid and will definately be taking again as soon as I can. Good luck to you! They might want your partners sperm tested first though as that is what my doc said to me xx|`|ZLpgjLPyaa	Ok I also have mild pcos(just the "cysts" on my ovaries) but all my bloodwork was normal. I would say that they will probably do a sperm analysis on your hubby and then do an HSG on you to see if your tubes are ok. These are the least evasive/inexpensive. Then if everything is good they will start you on clomid to get you to ovulate and maybe progesterone to regulate your period. Then they will do more bloodwork to see if you are actually ovulating and then up the dose of clomid or keep it the same depending on your follicle count. Also if DH sperm is an issue they will help with that. Are you going to an OB or and reproductive endocrinologist? Make sure with PCOS you see a specialist alot of OB's just put people on clomid unmonitored and this can be dangerous, it can overstimulate your ovaries and you can get cysts if you are not monitored which can lead to ovary removal. Good luck and hope this helped!!!
VH8MOEw8aa	What was she protecting him from? He wasn't in any danger. He got his heart broken, yeah, but he wasn't in any physical danger. The daughter beat up the girlfriend because she was angry. Sure it's great that she and her brother have such a great bond. However, there was no immanent danger. So, if this is ok now where do you draw the line? <br>  <br>  This is not going to be the only girl that hurts her brother. Will it be ok if she beats up all of them?  Maybe this is a one time thing, and maybe it's a precursor as to how she will handle her emotions in other situation down the line. The fact that she stood up for her brother is admirable to say the least. Not every brother has that kind of sister. But harming another person because you don't like what they did is not acceptable to me.|`|Ge8xMTgRaa	Nope. Why is she going to beat up the gf, I think that one is violence with no serious motive and second, her brother can deffend himself. If she thinks this is right, or well, she did it obviously, where is she getting all these ideas that by beating up a girl she`ll learn her lesson?<br>  Are you the parent? Talk to her, punish her, and let her know this is not right behavior for a lovely young girl. I know at her age, assuming she`s a teen, this makes her look cool, but it makes her look like she`s living on the streets with no education or class.|`|miAboZnMaa	Violence is never the answer to a problem.<br>  It was smart of her to stand up for her brother and you should be proud she did that but she should have done it in a non-violent manner. I suggest talking with her about violence and giving her a small punishment.|`|3fMK5moxaa	ummmmm<br>  I think i might feel glad inside tha the b***h got what was coming,<br>  but at the same time ,being a responsable parent, i would not let on to my feelings a tell my daughter theres no ecuse for voilance, and to stay out of her brothers buisness.|`|HYveAhbUaa	No I would not accept that!  No matter what someone does you can't go around beating people up...no matter the reason.  If she was taken to court the judge wouldn't care why she did it...|`|OsWiXTlOaa	I beat my children's boyfriends/girlfriends for this kind of thing all the time.<br>  Seems perfectly reasonable to me.|`|XgyHPhMzaa	I don't care what these other people say family is family and the GF should have broken up before cheating|`|ldQFvpHxaa	it is baddddd that your son's girlfriend cheated on him, but that is no reason to beat up someone|`|TYErFAAzaa	NO.  It isn't her place.  Nor is it any of her business!|`|ReCh1tCtaa	my older brother did that to one of my X boyfriends.<br>  i'm14|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	No, violence is only appropriate in self defense.  Anything else can be resolved with civil discourse.  <br>  <br>  What did beating the girl up do to solve the problem?  Did it fix anything?|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	no but my children would fight if someone was beating the other sibling or talking crap about them..you defend your family|`|01Mu3wUeaa	No, I wouldn't.It would be none of my daughter's business and she could face assault charges...I wouldn't try to defend her.<br>  <br>  <br>  Her brother is the one that needs to deal with this issue (dump the cheater's ****) not have his sister butt in.<br>  <br>  The only physical violence I can condone is self defense.|`|oK6sZ2fmaa	That should have been between the brother and his girlfriend, you didn't give their ages, but what's going to happen when brother forgives the girlfriend, hard feelings that's what, and besides she's got to let him pick his own battles, hard as it may be.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	I would tell her that well I'm happy she stood up for her brother, I don't condone violence. She would be grounded.|`|6Z4fKZ8aaa	No I wouldn't accept that.|`|bcM7Lxpeaa	no because no matter what someone does to you unless its self defense there is no reason for violence we are not mindless animals and there is no excuse you dont go around beating people up just because they upset you do you know how many people i would have beat up today if that was the case. probably around 10 violence doesn't show you care it just shows immaturity|`|hl5WdXnbaa	No... I would not want my daughter to get herself in trouble for something like that. Cheating is terrible but it is normal teenage drama.( heck even adults too). I would be happy she stood up for her brother but there is other  ways she could of helped him out.|`|AA11537580	no, it isn't any of her concern<br>  it is between her brother and his girlfriend<br>  she shouldn't beat anyone up|`|JtbeH1Mgaa	It is bad that she cheated on him but you shouldn't condone any violence from your child unless it is self defense.|`|AqgJyMn6aa	no<br>  you should teach her to only fight in self defense. not for any other reason.<br>  and that she should mind her own business.|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	Nooooooo...  People who fight are people who aren't smart enough to solve problems with their words.  I'd be ashamed if my daughter got into a fight!|`|LSJyE4d0aa	Absolutely not|`|aCUHzMrmaa	None of her business
ANHsv4ENaa	You saw something you knew wasn't very responsible and you spoke up. Good for you. I'd have more respect for someone who had something to say to me than someone who just never opens their mouth. If you tell me something stupid or ignorant then I will correct you but if I were in her position I would have said, "Thanks, you're right." Because maybe she just didn't think of it before she did it.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	No one likes to have their mistakes & shortcomings pointed out to them.  Do you?  <br>  <br>  I don't know that I would have 'caused a big scene' if you did that to me, but I would have thought you were kind of presumptuous.  Maybe they were going to share it.  Maybe the child was just holding it for mom.  Maybe they were filling the cup to give to a homeless person.  Who knows?  And, in the long run, a cup of pop, from time to time, is not going to cause any kind of long term harm.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I would have been seriously annoyed that you were telling me what to give my son, yes. I probably would have been to upset to say anything though. I usually don't like confrontation. I absolutely hate it when people tell me what to do with my kid. With that said I never give my daughter soda and know where you were coming from but that's her choice, not yours. Sorry sweetie.|`|a8IRxC4raa	No, I wouldn't have yelled at you.<br>  <br>  I would have said, "When I'm interested in your opinion, I'll ask for it."<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	I would have... Why are you concerned and offering advice to strangers? Thats wierd|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Nah. I would have never said that to someone. You don't know if that's the ONLY time the child gets soda...maybe she was sharing it with him. When my son and I go out to eat (since it's not very often) he knows it's a treat that he's going to get sprite and I usually tweak the rest of his diet for that day to accommodate for him having a sprite. I probably wouldn't have yelled back at someone but I would have been highly irritated that someone would tell me what to give my child.|`|Zb7CtLxbaa	Honestly, it serves you right. I wouldn't have personally made a scene, but I wouldn't have been to pleased. <br>  <br>  I'm all for sticking up for children in dangerous situations, but what's the harm in a little soda? You don't even know the circumstances! Maybe it was a treat. Maybe they were going to share it. Maybe he had a bad day and mom was trying to make up for it. Who knows?<br>  <br>  When it comes to that stuff, mind your own business. Wait until the dangerous stuff to open your mouth.|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	I wouldnt have yelled but I would have surely told you to mind your own  business. And yes Dont tell me what to do with my child is right! <br>  How would you like when a stranger comes and tells you what to do with your child??!! <br>  So yea the lady was right in telling you that.|`|S4y7V4diaa	Yeah. I mean yeah she is an idiot for giving a little kid soda but you just be glad you are not one of them. But it's not your business unfortunatly. Unless you see a child being smacked around don't do or say anything/|`|QveBSjFSaa	Yes, but I wouldn't have made a scene, I would have just said "Thanks, but I've got it from here".|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	Well i wouldn't have that problem my kids have never had soda. If you told me that i would say "ok i will give him less", thank you.|`|6Z4fKZ8aaa	I would be a little mad if some woman or man I didn't know told me what to do with my child/children.  No one knows how to raise your children except you and it's father.|`|AA11537580	wow, it wasn't any of your concern<br>  maybe that was a treat and he never normally gets soda.|`|dgRTkccBaa	That was actually kind of rude of you.  While giving a kid that age soda is probably not the best thing for him, it's really not any of your business.  Would you walk up to an adult eating a Big Mac and tell them it's not good for them?  Besides, you don't know what the situation was.  He could have been out for a special day with his mom and she let him have soda as a treat.<br>  I don't think I would have yelled at you, but I would have quietly told you to butt out.  If you're going to go around offering unsolicited advice to strangers you have to expect that some of them are going to react badly.|`|JtbeH1Mgaa	I wouldn't have made a scene but I don't want anyone telling me how to raise my child.  You should mind your own business about other peoples children unless they are being abused.|`|Ge8xMTgRaa	I wouldn`t have yelles at you. O would have just ignored you probably but because I don`t like conflict or making scenes. But definitely it`s not in your place to tell her that. You`ll be a mom someday and believe you won`t want a stranger telling you something like that.<br>  Plus, you don`t know the situation. Sometimes we go have lunch with our daughter and my husband, and most of the times my daughter gets hungry before we do, so I give her lunch at home, so when we get to the restaurant I let her have an ice cream and if it`s weekend, she can drink a coke. People at the restaurant might think, "look at those parents feeding their little girl ice cream and coke for lunch!" but little do they know she`s eaten healthy food at home and it`s a weekend, and she`s only allowed to have ice cream and coke during the weekend.<br>  So next time, for your sake, even if you hate what you`re seeing, stay quiet. At the end of the day, it was that mom`s business giving her that much soda to her kid, and it`s her paying for it!|`|KDf30Iqjaa	if its about the soda its up to the parents discretion how much and if its diet soda or not, but if its about disciplining then i would definitely say POLITELY... i am dealing with my child the way i have been told if you don't like that , then that's fine, that's your opinion!! Everybody has a right to have an opinion (good or bad!) and thank you for making your concerns heard (if the place is busy your in ... then you could end it with " for everyone to listen to!") but if not, just end it by saying thank you for your opinion it has been duly noted! and walk off ... preferably in the opposite direction!!
VFTArdQxaa	Tarren William is uterly adorable!<br>  <br>  Talija Paige<br>  Talija Aubrey<br>  Talija Jane|`|F7tyzrMzaa	I love Tarren William! I love how it combines and really unique name with a classic one. Great combo!<br>  <br>  The girl's name I'm not so hyped on. Is it pronounced "Ta-lee-ha" or "Ta-lee-ja" ?<br>  <br>  Either way, I'm not really keen on it. I look at it and think Taquila. But if you're going to use it I'd advise quite a common, classic middle name.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Oh, I've just seen Brandyn's answer. Is it Talia? I like that name actually, it's my step-mom's name. I agree with Brandyn, if it's Talia, spell it like that. Makes life a lot easier. My stepmom's name is Talia Susanne. I think that's pretty.<br>  <br>  Talija Grace?<br>  Talija Noelle?<br>  Talija Claire?|`|HMPdnhApaa	Tarren William sounds nice...I'm a little thrown off by Talija because my best friend's name is Talena Ta-Lee-Na. And her middle name is Marie..|`|mRQxlNH5aa	Talija Marie<br>  Talija Nicole<br>  Talija Jane<br>  Talija Danielle<br>  Talija Ruth<br>  Talija Evelyn<br>  <br>  Personally, I'd spell it Tahlia or Talia. I think putting the J in there will make it very difficult for her. I know that my cousin is naming his daughter Nadija with a J and as a person with a name spelled wrong all the time because there are different ways to spell it or because I spell it funny, it is a pain in the butt to deal with. It's a very pretty name though! I also like Tarren but I'd spell it Taryn. Tarren is Warren with a T so it might be pronounced incorrectly. Good luck!|`|cErLq7f3aa	i know a girl named Tarryn so that will always be a girl name to me. but i did know a boy who spelled it Teryn.<br>  <br>  i don't really like Talija but<br>  Talija Marie<br>  Talija Danielle<br>  Talija Savannah<br>  Talija Grace

lnp5yy3maa	I'm sorry for your loss. I also had a miscarriage for my first pregnancy. I'm now pregnant again (19 wks). I would recommend getting dollar store pregnancy tests so you can test as often as your heart desires (provided you don't get too upset over potentially false negatives). I got 6 false negatives before I got my BFP. Baby dust!|`|Npy1kswWaa	Kinda lost here
J3H3C5ksaa	I agree a lot.<br>  <br>  I don't like those shops, like Abercrombie, Hollister, Aero just have plain look a like things with their NAME SPLASHED ACROSS. And you pay-what $30 for a T? <br>  <br>  My parents are willing to buy those types of clothes & stuff, but, I just feel like an advertisement! A walking billboard! <br>  <br>  Fashion's a big deal because honestly, people are just plain followers. My friend, ALWAYS wears Aero, and I asked her once, "Why do you like wearing them?" You know what she said? Because of the brand & label. & she LIKES having logos splashed across her.<br>  <br>  Maybe it represents wealth or something if you can buy a sweater for $80, and it's plain but has "Hollister" covering half of it.|`|hstwNjNaaa	In the same way art's a big deal, or music. It's a way to express yourself. It's a shame that a lot of big brands aren't exciting or original and are completely over priced. High fashion is the art form that filters down and is diluted into mainstream brands and influences the trends of the season. I like seeing what good designers come up with, and I enjoy the process of dressing up and trying to find a bargain, so even though it's not the biggest thing in my life by a long way, I get why people like it so much. It's interesting and a really cool way to see how culture has changed over the years.<br>  <br>  I never got why people buy boring Hollister/Abercrombie clothes, but I guess it's popular and people feel they need to to fit in.<br>  <br>  So that's why I think fashion is a big deal.|`|1thzSbS8aa	Well, you can hardly call Hollister, A & E, Aero, and Juicy "high fashion". It's fashion for the masses, catering to the lowest common denominator of teen insecurities. They are selling conformity, not fashion. Teens are terrified of not conforming, standing out, being teased. These companies feed on that.<br>  <br>  They actually trick kids into paying top dollar to advertise their product for them. It's truly amazing what they've been able to accomplish with slick advertising and loud music. The clothes are nothing more than walking ads.<br>  <br>  But just wait. A lot of these kids are going to find out soon that their parents can't afford to keep them in their popular-brand habit any longer.|`|3Yfp3QUfaa	I agree. I think that people should wear what is comfortable. If other people dont like it who gives a ****. But, I guess thats not the way life works. We cant change it but we can help. I guess people are so desperate to be popular they are willing to do anything. I just where sweatpants and a shirt and a jacket. Im comfy and I am in style, my style. Im not a tomboy though...I wear like pink jackets and blue tight abercrombie sweatpants. But Im glad to say, I dont give a **** what people think about me as long as Im happy...<br>  <br>  ps. sry for the language..|`|Jp5sAxwnaa	I'm not obsessed with fashion, but I do like to look nice. A lot of the stuff I wear can be purchased for less than $20 apiece, even less if I get it from Goodwill or the thrift store downtown. I usually wear a t-shirt or a long sleeved blouse, a floral print or single color ankle length skirt, and decent shoes (that are surprisingly cheap). I think it's ridiculous and foolish to spend a lot of money just to advertise a company's brand for them (this was brilliantly spoofed in a Calvin and Hobbes comic). And I totally agree, putting money in what's "in" is a worthless investment, money that could go to charity or personal savings.|`|roFVNcrnaa	first of all those stores are not high fashion. they are just gimmicks. And fashion is important because what you wear on the outside reflects who you are on the inside. If you look disheveled on the outside you are probably emotionally disheveled. See how that works? Real high fashion is creating your own style. So that you feel comfortable but not rediculous. Dress how you want others to see you.|`|KaIJqHQgaa	I know what you mean. I shop at Kohls and Sears. I wear clothes that don't match. I just don't care. In 10 years those clothes are going to be out of style. I also don't like Hollister and Abercrombie because 4 years ago they got caught and were sued millions for only hiring white people and having non-white employees work in the back in late hours. Why would to give my money to a company like that?|`|3Pmq0rUMaa	I like fashion..but by that i mean cute clothes. I get my clothes at target, old navy, heck even walmart has cute clothes.  i don't shop at those other places because they make you pay so much for a shirt that looks like everyone else.  i don't get it. <br>  <br>  i agree with you kinda...fashion is a big deal...but where i get the cute clothes isn't.|`|0G7Ehzbuaa	I agree. The clothes we wear are made by people in impoverished nations getting paid only a dollar a day.|`|cdAQZJGpaa	i have no clue but i agree!|`|FGZR9RwDaa	wow..i shop at those places and i actually like the clothes they sell. not just because of the label.|`|pcjOQDymaa	honestly i dont know a single person that does that anymore.<br>  so you cant say EVERYONE just because you see one person asking it.<br>  if you are feeling so nice than why don't you actually do something to help those kids.
723QHuicaa	I JUST read that like 2min ago!<br>  <br>  When they said it was a black / asian female - I sort of thought, is this some kind of strict family that only wants boys, plus the baby was wrapped in a BLUE blanket. Like they were preparing for a boy, but got a girl.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, I just sent you Y!A mail about my question you answered :o)|`|xEXb96UKaa	i feel sorry for the poor baby, but her mother must have been very desperate and scared to do this. for all we know she could have been a young girl who got pregnant by the wrong guy. in some cultures that can be a death sentence for a woman. if she was to hand the baby to someone else she would have to disclose her identity, sign papers etc. but chances are that the mother was simply a scared young girl, and to give her credit, she did at least leave the baby in a block if flats outside somebodies frontdoor and not hidden somewhere in the woods where the baby probably wouldn't have been found until it was too late.<br>  i truly hope she has the courage to contact someone, even if it is just to get some medical and psychological help.<br>  don't judge her just yet. nobody knows the circumstances yet.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	It is really bad, but something was probably scaring the mother. This kind of behaviour is usually typical of someone who is either very young or in an abusive relationship.I just hope both mum and baby are okay and that the baby is taken to someone who loves them.|`|sgMno1PRaa	thats really bad, but we dont know the full detail of what happened and that mother could be suffering really badly with PD and not have anyone to support her.

I had a friend like that who was always comparing herself to me and got pregnant every time I was pregnant as if to say she had the newest newborn and take the attention from my babies.<br>  She had her house before I did and was always saying "Oh u and ur lil apt. why don't u buy ur house already?" I would just say I wasn't ready and wasn't gona get myself into something I wasn't ready for just to say I had my house.<br>  <br>  Now that I do have my house it is in a better neighborhood than hers and fits our needs better than hers does for her... and she sees that waiting got my family in a better place and now DOESN't have anything to say.<br>  FOR A TIME I STOPPED TALKING TO HER because of how she was with me.  Then slowly she noticed i wasn't gona keep on being her friend if she DIDN't ACT LIKE ONE.<br>  Some things are hard to ignore and if she doesn't change her ways u don't need her.  U will do better moving on.|`|kg18TbsGaa	the next time she tries comparing herself to you make it seem like a joke but be like yeah but i dont get all this free money like you do! and if she gets mad just be like i was just kidding .. you dont have to get so mad! haha|`|6JOTtBSGaa	Hmm, well OBVIOUSLY you seem to be the leader, so take charge, be the Alpha female, stand your ground! I would be extremly pissed off if my friend took my son-to-be's name! So what i say, is you should invite her to dinner, make a crappy meal make her eat it, maybe she'll get food poisioning for a couplde days, phone her and be like "Foo, Do you really wanna be like me! THINK NOT! BU BYEE B****" ... but thats just me ^^ Muajajaj<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|HYrs7qzBaa	GO TELL THE DE FAX PEOPLE IF I WAS YOU I WOULD ....

If not I wouldn't see any reason to even be around her.|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	The fact that she would obviously steal a name she knew was the chosen name for your son tells you it all - she is not a friend.<br>  <br>  People (commonly people on benefits) say you should not "shop a benefits cheat" but think about it, YOU are paying for them.  What they're actually saying is "let me claim YOUR taxes and don't complain about it, run along to work, and I shall sit at home and do nothing".  So ring in, and shop them, anonymously.<br>  <br>  You are doing the best by your son, showing him that hard work and sticking to a budget can pay off - she is breeding the next generation of benefit scroungers (well mummy just lied and got money).<br>  <br>  Do the right thing.<br>  x|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	I don't think that you can say anything to her without putting the friendship on rocks.

Sounds like you can't stand this girl, so why not just move on?|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	I would ask her what her plans are to teach her children about lying, cheating, etc  and being a role model.  When she does come down on you or brag - basically throw your morals at her.|`|1hciyvKdaa	You will feel better if you stop worrying about others and worry more about yourself and your own family and your own business. Remember you work hard for what you get and it feels better inside to do so. I dont know exactly what you mean comparing herself to you, but Id stop worrying about her. If you dont enjoy her company, dont hang out. Lifes too short to concern ourselves with others. Some people lie about their situtaion too, so she may be embellishing some of that info you take as gospel ok. There will always be those who recieve more for less efforts, its easy to get jealous, just try harder not to be ok.|`|TqOdbhNAaa	If you don't want her to abuse the system, contact welfare or whoever you have to contact.  <br>  <br>  Honestly, this bothers me as I have students who do the same thing and I just can't believe their laziness.   You should totally report her and stop being her friend, what a waste.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	i would report her anonimously seriously that doesnt sound right at all, i dont think she should be entitled to it...if she annoys you taht much ditch her...she shouldnt be trying to be better than you anyways thats not a friend|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	turn her boyfriend in. if you make a claim that he is working they will investigate him. just do it anonymously.|`|GNLYxY7kaa	sounds like she is a shady selfish person anyways, i wouldnt want to be her friend|`|8WbfmK5daa	She doesn't sound like much of a friend.<br>  <br>  I would be livid if one of my friend's named their daughter the name I had already chosen for my daughter.<br>  <br>  If she annoys you that much just don't bother with her anymore.<br>  <br>  But if you want to remain friends with her just tell her the truth but she probably wont like it but there is nothing else you can did if you need to get it of your chest.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|hSJnaysiaa	Its not really your place to say anything.<br>  <br>  Yes, she sounds annoying, but I think the best thing is to just ignore her. <br>  <br>  She's not going to change her ways just because you don't agree with her lifestyle and it'll likely ruin your (already strained) friendship.<br>  <br>  I just wouldn't hang out with her anymore, don't let it get to you.<br>  <br>  I have a friend who annoys me in other ways. She has a 1 year old, and lives with her babies father (and is romantically involved with him...at least he thinks so and their families think so) but then she has a new guy "on the side" like every week it seems. And she's always telling me "I think this is the one", but she won't leave her childs father because he supports her. Its super annoying to me, and she exposes her daughter to all these guys too. I don't respect it though, so I just avoid her most of the time because I don't want to hear it.|`|uLdeIhHqaa	First of all- Put it like this: Your husband, who is a hardworking man is PAYING for YOUR friend to live OFF he GOVERMENT!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Its not RIGHT. You for sure, need to turn her in. Its not fair that people who are just trying to get by, who are hardworking people, are having to pay for other people who are lazy and want to cheat the system. Its a crying shame that people WHO REALLY TRULY need goverment assistance cannot get it because of people like her. <br>  <br>  Another thing is- She doesnt sound like a friend if she is always "comparing" her things to yours, if she named her son what you had told her you were naming hers, etc.....Thats NOT a true friend. You should have a civil adult talk with her and tell her you really value her friendship but you feel a little insulted by all her remarks she has made....But, you really probably shouldnt say anything to her about the welfare if you really still want to be her friend like you say you do. But, if you are really offended by her cheating the goverment either talk with her or turn her in.|`|x8JRkRNkaa	Oh, I hear you!! That is outrageous! I'm not you and that made me mad reading it. She is getting a free ride for sure. The only advice I can give you is just the peace of mind knowing you're a better person. Really you are. You're not using anyone. I have nothing against anyone getting help when they need it, but if someone else is already paying for everything for them why is so much help needed? It's just wrong. I see why you're frustrated. I have a cousin very much like that. Who is always comparing herself to me. I hate it more than anything in the world. She is one of those people that if you tell her she is wrong she just doesn't hear it. Good luck.
wENdWT5kaa	I have tons of red stretch marks from my second baby.<br>  <br>  It's itchy because its your skin "shrinking" back. <br>  <br>  I heard Noxema is good, just don't know if it's used for the stretch marks or the itchiness. You can also use lotion for the itchiness too.|`|png0sxZnaa	Its just because ur skin is still so sore and raw from giving birth!<br>  <br>  Get a good moisturiser or stretch mark correcting cream and rub it on at least twice daily!

(I also have a homework playlist to get me working)<br>  I say shower at night or just wet your hair, that way you save a little time in the morning, also ask your parents to make you breakfast that way you don't have to deal with stale pop tarts.<br>  I'm sure I have more but thats all for now hope I helped!|`|k3sL7mZtaa	I was a teen Mom at 17 and going to school at the same time so I know what it's like to have no time!<br>  Try having showers at night.

YJNql5Mgaa	We got Pampers in the hospital and they worked great.

I've babysat for years and the only kids who never leaked through there diapers were wearin pampers, with every other brand they always did, so when i had my son i decided to use pampers, plus the pampers always seemed a lil  softer than the huggies or some of the other brands.<br>  Hope this helps, :D.|`|gvLjbVFJaa	I like them both actually. <br>  Although, I had problems with Huggies when my baby was still in preemie sizing since they were cut for babys who had larger and more fat on their legs. They work a lot better now that she has some meat on her legs. <br>  <br>  I really like Pampers Swaddlers since they are so soft. I never had a leak or a problem with the Swaddlers.|`|4U9y2pLBaa	Pampers are much better! Huggies just leaked everywhere and I found that they didn't hold anything at all.

My son is tall & lean, so that could have something to do with them fitting him better. A few months ago I tried testing out Pampers and Luvs, and both were just horrible on him... not staying in place and leaking. So even if I'm in the minority, Huggies in our family :-)|`|VBlrL1puaa	I've experience both and used both on a trial bases with my daughter from newborn-11 months. Huggies are absolutely terrible! I used the huggies umbilicol cord care and they are not form fitting what so ever! The poop went right up my daughters back and she could wiggle them very low. She was an average baby at 7 lbs 12 oz. so she wasnt super tiny. I then switched to pampers sensative swaddlers and absolutely loved them! They have a yellow strip which turns green when theyre wet!!!! These were amazing! Once she grew out of those i switched to pampers cruisers and love these as well! Go with pampers!|`|j7Mxfr1yaa	i love huggies i have never had a problem with them...<br>  <br>  i did use the pack of newborn pampers i got while i was in the hospital and the mesh net really does catch the poop well|`|66633d9122b3aa8042ed5b75071a98d0aa	Huggies wipes are rough, but their newborn diapers are great.

LZAF4DYZaa	Well there are things that are helpful, but they don't work for everyone. We didn't use lubrication since the glycerin in it can be a spermicide, I took prenatal vitamins 3 MONTHS before even TTC also I drank no caffeine, changed my diet and used OPK tests for 2 months to track my ovulation (not everyone ovulates like clockwork, some are the same every month and some are alternating). And of course change sex positions ever so often!! We were blessed and got pregnant in 2 months. You should consider marriage if your you're wanting to have kids, it makes for a more stable environment. (nothing against single parents) just letting you know.|`|a3GQF2cAaa	Hi, alot of people get confused as to when ovulation occurs, because the average cycle length is 28 days, alot of people believe that ovulation occurs in the middle of the cycle, this is not the case. Ovulation occurs 14 days before your period so, if you were to have a 28 day cycle (counting the day you start your period as day 1) then ovulation will occur on day 14 of your cycle, if however, your cycle is 30 days then you will ovulate on day 16 of your cycle (always 14 days before you come on). The best time to have sex would be between days 10 - 16 (if you have a 28 day cycle) or days 12 - 18 (if you have a 30 days cycle), adjust these numbers based on your cycle length. One way to tell if you are ovulating is to check your cervical mucus, it will change throughout your cycle, as soon as you notice your cervical mucus looks and feels like egg whites (clear and very stretchy), now would be a good time to have sex as this mean you are at your most fertile. Body temperature testing is good for long term testing to figure out what days you are most fertile, but it will not tell you when to have sex that month because it will detect ovulation just after it happens (by which time it is too late to do anything about it). Ovulation tests (pee on a stick) are ok to use but i found them a nightmare to read most of the time and spent a fortune on them as they are not as easy to read as pregnancy tests (read the packet and you will see why).<br>  <br>  Hope this all makes sense, and good luck getting pregnant :)|`|vsuXCMqzaa	First, check the calendar and determine what your average cycle is. Count from the first day of your period to the first day of your next period. Some people it's 28, others it's 29, 30, 31, etc.<br>  <br>  Once you figure out your average, divide it in half. Example, if it's 28 then half is 14. This means that around day 14 you "may" be ovulating. Count from the first day of your period to day 14 and circle this on the calendar.<br>  <br>  Then, just have fun with your guy. And try to have more fun on days 10-18 because that's when you "may" be ovulating.<br>  <br>  But again, it's not perfect. And the books will all tell you that you can get pregnant at any time so just do it all the time. If it doesn't work for you within 6 months to a year (the average it takes to get pregnant - honestly) then you can always try the at home ovulation kits or talk to your doctor.

7jXChfBNaa	well if the blood wasn't your period if it was just some spotting you could be pregnant but maybe not. if you haven't already you should take a home pregnancy test and if it says negative then it will be accurate if your period is late. but if your period is not yet late then it could say negative but really be too soon to tell. i recommend the clear blue easy kind that says pregnant/not pregnant. hope that helps ya=} good luck.|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Blood? Perhaps a Period? You did say a month...<br>  You only know if you test.<br>  You should use two methods of protection....a condom in addition to something else..|`|IE1LvgD9aa	Could've given you an STD. Get checked!|`|bN98JC3Waa	from what you are saying i think you are probably pregnant, but don't take my word for it. what you need to do is get a pregnancy test and take it, then ,no matter if the results are positive or negative, just make an appointment with a doctor to make sure. i think you might be over reacting which is pretty normal because you are scared. i suggest just relax, take deep breathes, and keep in contact with the last guy you had sexual relations with because he going to have to know. but for right now just calm down and wait patiently for your answers. i haven't had this scare yet but i can tell you that worrying all the time will not help at all......GOOD LUCK!!!!|`|PPNlNc92aa	Try taking an actual pregnancy test.......|`|mFEevGRXaa	if you had blood its probably your period starting!!
Coc593Ikaa	Well I am an American, so I don' tknow about Brits.<br>  <br>  However, I can tell you that it is considered quite tacky to give yourself a shower. They are thrown for you by a friend or family member. And it is a fun way to celebrate the bringing of a new life into the fold.|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	My husband is from England and he was so confused with the whole baby shower and wedding shower we had.  Since, he said that's something you guys don't do over there.<br>  <br>  Well, you could always speak to your Mum about the idea or your friend like you were mentioning.  It's so fantastic having all these women celebrating the "soon to be " birth of your baby.  You feel like such a queen!  I had my baby shower at around 9 months.  That's normally when women throw the baby shower.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	maybe u could talk to one of ur girlfriends and tell her about the baby shower and what its about and have her throw and invite people so it doesnt seem like ure the one that wants this donw u know?<br>  also maybe u can just have like a party for the celebration of a new life coming into the world and asy gifts are accepted.<br>  <br>  anyways ure not supposed to throw ur own babyshower ... <br>  my mother in law is throwing me one and my girlfriend is throwing me one as well|`|LFXTpqfdaa	Well, the whole idea of the baby shower here in the US is that somebody else throws it for you. It is considered rude if the mommy-to-be throws herself the baby shower. The only thing we're supposed to do is register at a baby store so people know what to buy.<br>  <br>  How do Brits manage to get all their baby stuff? I know I couldn't afford buying all the stuff that needs to be bought, all at once.|`|92529423230d8afd2de97a390c4c8c8faa	Maybe you can ask this in another section of Yahoo Answers. In this pregnancy category I think most of us are American and most of us have had Baby Showers so most of us are going to agree that you should have one.<br>  Of course you don't throw it for yourself - your friend or family member plans one for you.|`|dn2UCOkqaa	You shouldn't stereotype us AMERICANS. It's not a rule to who can have a baby shower and who can't. So go ahead and have one,there isn't a law saying you can't.|`|8h5OYw4Haa	It's typically an american tradition. If Brits as you say are not accustom to this and that's who you would invite, maybe ask them about the idea.<br>  <br>  In America, it is very helpful for the parents to register (create a list of specific items) from a baby store so people know what to get you. It is not rude at all to send invitations for a baby shower...most people have them. Sometimes the older Americans believe that a baby shower should take place after the baby is born. Some traditions believe that you will jinx the pregnancy by having one before baby comes...that's just a superstition.|`|058cbe8f080311800ecccf5877b18677aa	Someone definitely needs to throw a shower for you, a family member or friend.  People love to buy baby stuff so most of the time they're excited to attend.  Plus having a baby is expensive!  My shower is next week!|`|RyX6yhUbaa	its oka to have baby showers, well, for me... i wanna have one when i get pregnant... its really nice to let your family members know that your exited to be expecting a baby... go for it!!!|`|AA10830003	No!<br>  Your Thinking In A Wrong Way.<br>  Its When People Come Along & Celebrate The Coming Or A New Life.<br>  & People Bring Gifys Also To Give To The Welcoming Baby!

Its hard at first but once you get into a routine it gets easier.|`|JtbeH1Mgaa	My little boys are 13 months apart.  They were adopted though so I didn't plan it that way.  I think it's easier when kids are close in age though.  They get along better, like the same things and  don't fight as much. (This is just from my experience and from watching my friends kids, cousins, etc.)  They do tend to be more jealous though of each other though.|`|qCFwSyFAaa	i am 11 and my brother is 10

Great resource on getting on well through the ages is The Total Transformation program which you can find by checking out our parenting blog at <a href="http://positiveparentingskills.com." rel="nofollow">http://positiveparentingskills.com.</a> Lots of great information.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	The library.

QMWlOSXraa	There's no harm in trying, if your daughter doesn't like it or appears to get bored easily just take her out.<br>  Remember to check up on this agency, make sure everything is above board.<br>  Just don't force her into anything.<br>  Its a good way to start up a savings fund for your daughter!<br>  As long as you feel she is safe and secure..why not?|`|AfjcRXaiaa	don't let her model the real money is in t.v. and movies. get an agent and let her work in some t.v. shows.|`|HYveAhbUaa	watch a couple of episodes of toddlers and tiaras before you decide.|`|nnYW2jVYaa	go it for it she can always quit|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	The Soup made an interesting comment on the last episode when they were making fun of Rock of Love, then Toddlers and Tiaras, on how Toddlers and Tiaras was prepping those girls for life on the Rock of Love Bus.|`|XkHiFJMKaa	NO<br>  let her be a baby|`|9IFF0vIoaa	33% is pretty high...especially if you need to pay for headshots yourself, or drive her out of the area.

I wouldn't use that for the sole reason to make this decision.  Does she take direction well?  Would she be able to sit while someone applied makeup & changed clothes every few minutes?  What if strangers had to help put her into poses while you were simply standing by...would she do what they asked?<br>  <br>  Lots of things you may want to look at before taking the plunge!  :)  Hope whatever the decision is you are happy.|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	I would do it!

5e4e7e69ebfb2ce16276f743ee45219eaa	I highly doubt that the welfare office would take the time to verify that your dad's company has worker's comp.  I'm shocked that he doesn't, but I guess he's just keeping his fingers crossed that nothing happens to anyone.  The small expense is infinitely better than the risk of losing everything he owns when someone sues him personally over even a minor injury.  <br>  <br>  Off topic, but I have some advice for you.  Don't turn in applications and then sit back and wait for a call.  We opened a new business about a month ago and I received nearly 300 applications for the 12 positions I hired for.  I didn't even look at 90% of the applications I received.  The 20 or so people who called to check on their application status are the ones that got interviews and I hired from those.  You need to follow up on your application within 30 minutes of turning it in via phone call to the person in charge of hiring.<br>  <br>  Back to your question, if your husband isn't receiving a pay stub then just tell the welfare office he is getting paid under the table and his employer won't verify income for them but that you want to be as honest as possible so you're telling them.  It won't be the first time that someone has been in that situation and they'll know how to handle it.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	Tell the truth. Its against the law to lie. If you get caught you have to re-pay everything. You could even face jail time. They have ways of finding out.|`|zY9PdRGjaa	fyi: majority of people getting it are lieing, in some way or the other..|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Yeah you are in a tough spot.<br>  <br>  The other problem is if your husband is hurt on the job he's screwed.<br>  <br>  When you tell food stamps your husband's income do they ask for the employer's name or pay stubs or something?  <br>  <br>  I'm not that up on US law, but you might be able to set up a "shell company" that your father contracts the work out to, and then the company pays hubby.  The up side of this is that if your hubby starts making a tonne of money (haha, I know) that he can pay you to do his bills, secretarial work, etc (whether or not you actually do the work) as a way of income splitting.  Also he can write off more expenses that way.  It could also help with food stamps if some months hubby makes too much even though the overall rate is low enough to qualify.  The months he makes extra the money could sit in the company and he could get paid a flat amount per month.<br>  <br>  If you know an accountant or tax attorney that would answer your questions free, that might be the best way out of this situation.  Particularly if hubby generally does contracting type work (mine does, he's an audio engineer *lol*)|`|cz5XbKfOaa	The food stamp office doesn't report to the Labor Board, IRS, or Worker's Compensation. You can tell your dad he has nothing to worry about. We use the income for food stamp purposes only.|`|qyM4mTWDaa	Don't lie about it... But u will not face jail time but they will make u REPAY everything they gave you....

It's honestly people that abuse the system that are the problem. I know times get rough, but then you need to solve the situation by either you getting a job or your husband will need to pick up a 2nd job. what your father is wanting you to is FRAUD.|`|Ph3sh6Goaa	Tell your dad that you could get into serious trouble for lying, including prison time.  It's not worth it.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I'm getting reall tired of posts like the one above.  Just because a person has a car doesn't mean they can NOT afford groceries.  Most people need their car to get their kids to/fro school, and also to work.  Getting food stamps doesn't mean a person has to get rid of everything but the clothes on their backs!!  I wasn't going to say anything, but it just pisses me off.|`|g7wQij2Oaa	Do not lie about it. Nothing good will ever come out of lying. It might seem like an easy way out for now, but it will eventually catch up with you. If you still need assistance even with the money your hubby makes from your dad, then there's a chance you will still be able to get the food stamps.<br>  Say lots of prayers that you can find a job/become financially stable. <br>  Just please don't be low enough to lie.<br>  <br>  Oh and if you tell the truth and have to go off food stamps, just plan your meals better. Cut coupons and watch deals. You can cut grocery bills in half if you take time to plan.<br>  <br>  :)|`|nrTVlo8Eaa	Doesn't it make you mad when you see people using food stamps to buy things like standing rib roasts and then driving away in brand new Escalades?<br>  <br>  I know this isn't your situation, but the reason the above scenarios make us so mad is that we, the ones who ARE working, find large deductions taken out of each paycheck to pay state taxes, to fund people who defraud the public assistance program. And, like you say, make it more difficult for people who really DO need assistance.<br>  <br>  You need to follow your conscience. Is it your fault, or even your problem, that your father chooses [illegally] not to have workmen's compensation insurance? If he wasn't a family member you'd never think twice about doing the right thing. It's a shame when the child has to be more mature than the parent.<br>  <br>  You are not the pivot that your family's happiness or heartbreak depend on for balance. You can only do what's right for you and your immediate family, and sometimes taking the high road  is a lonely place to be. But it's the RIGHT thing to do.|`|IlyS8KGzaa	Ok, here is the thing.  How often does your husband work for your dad?  If your father does not pay him VIA paycheck with taxes taken out and all that good stuff, then technically, he is unemployed.  Basically he is a laborer.  He gets paid cash yeah?  Have him fill out a 1099 form for monies received, take it to the food stamp place, and just be honest with them.  More than likely if your husband does not work for your dad and make more than say 600.00 per month, then you are not going to get cut off.  There are 3 of you in your "household" right?  If so, then your pay bracket will be higher than that of a household of say 1 or 2.  Therefore, you're allowed to make more money before you go over the limit.<br>  <br>  What ever you do, DO NOT LIE to anything involving the federal government, especially the food stamp division.  They will prosecute you to the highest extent, including having to pay back any money (food stamps) and possibly jail time.  Where does that leave your child if you go to jail??<br>  <br>  I'm not trying to scare you, but it is something you should think about|`|68c6B8dRaa	Can your father pay him extra to make up for his playing fast-n-loose with the employment laws? That would square things up all around, it seems.<br>  <br>  If your father's answer to that is "no," well, you needn't feel so bad about your answer to him re. BSing the welfare office also being "no."

33h5R8nTaa	I honestly never liked the first one, someone bought me one and i took it back because i thought thats pointless i can hold her just as easy as wearing that. I actually got a hot sling and i love it...I goes up to 2 i think or 18 months. It has a packet in it and it shows u how to fold it for different holds. It kinda like the second one but i think it might have more support. you can find it at <a href="http://www.hotslings.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hotslings.com/</a>|`|Oq2B7I4faa	I would personally choose the first one <a href="http://www.ergobabycarriers.com/babycarr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.ergobabycarriers.com/babycarr...</a>  I used very similar kind with less expensive one and they were great with my newborn.  I used to carry her everywhere in there and she was very comfortable and sound sleep all the time.  I used to feed her in there too, when we were out.

My husband also likes the pack. <br>  <br>  Another carrier that I loved when he was small was the Moby Wrap I have also used the Maya sling. I like having an extra in case of spit up or anything like that. <br>  <br>  Good luck! Babies love being worn so you are off to a great start!|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	i like the first one <br>  it seems like a good one <br>  will carry a heavier baby and has back support <br>  <br>  it is on the pricy side tho|`|oUtEVKDHaa	The first one looks cute and comfortable for the baby. I have one but not as expensive as taht one. probably 30 bucks and I've only used it 4 times and my bbay is 7 months. I used it when she was 2 months and it was good because she can rest her head the bad thing about that is that my back really hurt!! worse than pregnancy . well of course you know hte baby IS bigger. anyway, i put her in recently too and you can face them the other way.. i think the first one is better. but it's really expensive there's other one's that are good and aren't that expensive...
8WbfmK5daa	Your not wrong for wanting to stop him from what he was doing but I doubt he understood the warning of 'if you do it again you will go to your room' and once he was placed in his room he probably didn't realise what for so not sure it would be an effective form of discipline.<br>  <br>  Im always wary now of placing a child in their cot as punishment. One of my friends used this method as discipline for her 18 months old son he began to associate the cot with discipline and he would not sleep in it. He relentlessly screamed until he was taken out of it.<br>  <br>  You were right for telling him no and if he continue you should of placed him away from the dog either in play pen or travel cot.<br>  <br>  You weren't wrong to discipline him though so don't feel bad you need to teach your son right from wrong but it is hard at this age to be abe to use an effective form of discipline.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	At 8 months redirecting there behavior tends to work better. If he is not patting the dog nice you show him how or remove him from the dog and give him something else to do. Closer to 15-20 months time outs will work, the rule is 1 minute for each year so 1-2 minutes in time out is plenty. <br>  <br>  You will find yourself doing it over and over again, it can be exhausting. They just don't understand it completely yet. When he does do something good make sure to let him know, say good job or clap with a big smile on your face to show that he can get positive attention. When he has a fit don't feed into it, just walk away and ignore it.|`|pXSKSS3daa	An 8 month old doesn't understand "No", just the tone of your voice.

The sooner you have a routine on how to deal with bad behavioir the quicker you will have it in control.|`|ROJans2Taa	I personally dont believe in time outs till around 2, with my son and daughter when they were/are that young, I just say TaTa thats not nice, and remove their hands and move them onto something more positive like a toy, now that my daughter is 7, she gets one warning then depending on the act she'll either get a toy thrown out or one taken away for a specified time, in the end though it;'s your child and if you feel timeouts are best you gotta do what you think is right, your always going to get opinions on what when and how to punish, just find what works and stick with it, best luck|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	It isn't to early to start teaching him the difference between right and wrong. However 5 minutes is too long for an 8 month old. All doctors I have ever seen recommend 1 minute for every year of age, so 1 minute for your little guy. Make sure where ever you put him for his alone time, he is safe and can not get hurt and there is nothing to entertain him, otherwise he will just play and not connect that what he did was not nice.|`|A2XYCdOYaa	I see where you are coming from totally.  You'll probably get a mixed response to this question but saying 'No' to your child is not the same as spanking etc, it is just a word and will do no harm.  At 8 months he should begin to understand the different tones of your voice, so saying No firmly should make him see what he is doing is not right.|`|uQc4UA2Caa	its a hard one. he sounds to be testing u so u do need to show authority. maybe as he is so little make it 2 or 3 mins instead an u can increase the time as he gets older if u need to. does he cry in his room when u do that? does he realise he has been naughty.<br>  im about to become a mum too and i would probably do the same if i didnt have babys dad to help me. (he has a very good 11 yr old girl)|`|ibWLdXlJaa	There's a rule on time outs. One minute for every year. More than that and they won't remember what they got in trouble for. Not that he will at 8 months anyway.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	maybe a tap on the hand would have worked better|`|2F5HNPqPaa	At 8 months, he may understand the word "no" but won't fully understand it's a serious word that means "stop now".  To him, you saying no was attention and probably more of a game to him.  He wouldn't understand your threat either about sending him to his room.  Also, his memory and understanding of the world would mean he had no idea whatsoever why you took him up there... he wouldn't be able to "connect" I touched the dog, mummy said no, now I'm here as a punishment.  <br>  <br>  Sending children to their rooms is mainly to give them time to think about what they've done or to calm down.  He could do neither!  Also, it's recommended (if you use time out/sending to bedroom) that you send them for 1 minute per year of their life.  At 8 months, that's less than 1 minute!  <br>  <br>  At this age, the best you can do as far as discipline is remove him from the situation and rather than just "no" say "Leave puppy alone, he's sleeping!" then distract him with something else (like a toy).  This method will be a lot better from now, through toddlerhood as he'll learn WHY he shouldn't do things, not just that mummy always says no!  Plus distraction will help avoid tantrums and upset.  You could try timeout in the future, say from about 18 months or whenever you feel he's old enough to fully understand.<br>  <br>  You're right to be starting discipline now; it's a good time.  Just make sure it's age appropriate and matches his understanding of the world.  Good luck!|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	This age is not just about telling them what not to do.  You need to teach them what they are allowed to do as well.  So don't just say "no" when he touches the dog.  Instead, tell him, "Pet the dog gently," and take his hand and show him how.  My son is 18 months old, and our cats will actually let him pet them from time to time because we've taught him how to be gentle with them.  No, your 8-month-old is not going to understand right away, so you do have to be consistent.<br>  <br>  It's way too early for time-outs, and I think time-outs can have their place with toddlers and preschoolers.  He's just not going to understand that yet.<br>  <br>  It's also normal for them to throw fits at this age.  Depending on the situation, usually the best thing to do is distract him with something else -- remove him from the situation.  Talk to him about his feelings -- that you know he's angry/frustrated/etc., but he can't have whatever he wants.  Offer an acceptable alternative.  <br>  <br>  There are also times that you have to make sure that he's somewhere safe (where he can't hurt himself with his tantrum) and simply ignore him.  Different things work for different kids and in different scenarios, so you'll have to play around and see what works with your child.<br>  <br>  Just remember that you are his teacher, and he needs to learn from you the proper way to behave.  That means that you need to give him lots of acceptable alternatives for anything he does that is unacceptable.  Try to use "no" as little as possible, or it will become meaningless.  And love and cuddle that baby as much as possible -- they grow up way too quickly.|`|EyKJ737daa	Definitely not wrong to discipline your child sweetie, as he gets older and 8months is the start of it, they become much more aware of their surroundings and what they want in their little lives, usually what they want right now and if they don't get it, they chuck a wobbly.  Start now with time out etc because he will learn much earlier what mummy says goes, not what he wants by chucking a wobbly.  I'm sure your little man will grow up very well behaved sweetie.  I have 3 girls and I have started around the same time with all of them too and everyone comments on how well behaved they are and how well they are with their manners.  It does pay off and it does get easier as they get older and learn what is expected of them.  As for handling the fits, you are doing just great, time out away from fun is just the way to do it.  you will be very surprised to see how quickly he will put the 2 together and realize that his behaviour has consequences.  My 17 month old starts to whinge at times when she wants something and I say no to her. She'll the start with the crocodile tears and I will ask her if she wants to go to bed very firmly. She will very quickly shake her head for no. "Well stop crying" and she does in an instant and goes off to play with her sisters.  Amazing to watch but they are sponges this young and what you teach them now is the foundation for them through life.  You are doing a great job sweetie, keep it up xx|`|JxPw8OaHaa	I think that 8 months old is too early for that type of punishment. Showing him how to pet the dog and telling him to be nice would have been a better response, if he continued to pull at the dog remove him from the situation. Sounds to me that he is testing you to see what will get him a positive response, put him in a play pen or restricted area and let him throw a fit on his own he will learn that doing certain things will not get him the attention he wants.|`|x8JRkRNkaa	8 months old is really too young to expect your child to know what you're talking about when you tell him you're going to put him in his room for 5 minutes. You've accomplished nothing by doing it. He doesn't understand. Why do you think he continued to do it even when you told him what you were going to do? I totally agree with time outs, when the child is old enough to understand why he is there. You're expecting too much from a baby. He is just a baby.|`|IjIcSNudaa	i have a great 3 year old and i started when she was 4 month when she started throwing. what you did is right time outs and saying firmly <br>  NO is the right thing to do. she/he will learn not to bad things. You can't let him or her push you around. you are the parent and you can't let it go out of control and out of hand.|`|f5Ed8Efyaa	when my children were that age and got into or touched stuff that they shouldn't i use to give a small tap on the hand tell them no and moved them away from what it was and if they continued i put them in their room. i don't think that 8 months is to young to start with discipline. it never harmed my kids.|`|mXyqcAy5aa	I have had 3 children and i personally think 8 months is far too young ,  they dont really understand what your saying , its like toilet trainning  ,  until they understand what your talking about they wont get it .   I  would have picked him up and moved him or distracted him with something eles or maybe put the dog somewhere eles out of his reach.|`|AA11624887	He is not too young to hear no, but he is too young to be put in time out.  If he continues to pull the dogs hair, tell him no and them move him so the dog is no long in reach.<br>  <br>  You are on the right track, but don't go overboard, he is still really little.|`|FhEUCrttaa	I don't think that it is too young. I started doing the same thing around that time. My son is 9 months, he knows the word no. When he is doing something that I don't want him to do I tell him no and he usually stops. If he continues I pick him up and take him away from the situation.|`|a9b3850496c6d2e026d3e06d78b32ecfaa	Your son has not the memory for a 5 minute time-out. The rule of thumb is 1 minute per age- so a 4 year old would receive 4 minutes and so on. <br>  <br>  Remove the child from the situation- yes.<br>  Say no- yes.<br>  Slap hands??? No- no need. Just remove him and tell him no. Then give him a "yes" thing. He may not understand your words but model to him how you treat the dog- "We pet gently. See how I am petting the dog, gentle. That's nice"<br>  <br>  In this way- you are removing, modeling, and giving his something appropriate he can have. <br>  <br>  If he throws fits- fine. They will...some kids start earlier than others. It is important that you do not give in to him though.<br>  <br>  Edit- 1 minute is still too long at 8 months old. I have to say, even a 1 year old is too young to remember what they did and what happened. Just remove him and give him a "yes" thing and model the appropriate behavior. When he gets older, sit with him and talk about what happened and "make it right again". Help him to see what the right behavior is. We have a 12 year old autistic son and this has worked wonders for him as well as our now 2.5 year old.|`|lSPSd36Zaa	Little ones behave the way we teach them based upon our reactions to their actions. If we smile or laugh when they do something cute or precocious they will do it again cause they like that reaction from us.<br>  <br>  The important thing is to be consistant and age appropriate with discipline. 8 months is too early for a 5 minute time out. <br>  <br>  He must know that you are serious, that you are unhappy with his actions and you must react the same way each and everytime in such a way that he will learn that you aren't pleased.<br>  <br>  When he throws fits after you tell him no, ignore him. Don't give in just to quiet him down. Place him in his high chair or his playpen where you can observe him, but pretend that you aren't. When he realizes he isn't getting the reaction he was hoping for from you, he will stop fussing. If he's in his playpen he is certain to throw out his toys expecting you to throw them back in. Don't. Put them on the sofa, a chair or a table instead where he can see them but not reach them.<br>  <br>  Only return a toy(s) to him after he quiets down. If he throws it out again, repeat the process. Do not give him anything he wants while he is being fussy. That reinforces bad behavior. When a parent rewards bad behavior the child continues to behave badly knowing they will get their own way.<br>  <br>  When he hurt the puppy by yanking his hair' you should say "no" and grab his hands at the same time. And continue to hold them and  say "no"  while holding them firmly, but not tight. And you need to look at him with a serious expression on your face. Repeat this process just three times. If he tries to pull the dogs hair or ears after that stick him in his high chair. <br>  <br>  Were you in the living room playing with the puppy when he started hurting him? Then move the high chair in there,with your son securely seated and pick the puppy up and sit and cuddle and pet the puppy with your son watching you. Dont go near your son with the puppy keep a slight distance from him. When your son realizes he isn't getting to play with the puppy and that he isn't getting your attention the way he wants it, he will quiet down.<br>  <br>  When he is quiet, remove him from the high chair  and place him on the floor beside you and the puppy. How does he react? If he hurts the puppy again take his hands and say no. Only do this three times. Return him to his high chair and let him watch while you play with the puppy. When your son calms down take him out of the high chair and place him once more on the floor with you and the puppy. <br>  <br>  Repeat the entire process as often as it is necessary. Do this only three times in a day. It might not take more than a few times or it might take a few days.<br>  <br>   And under no circumstance allow your son to be near the puppy until he does treat him kindly.<br>  <br>  If your son treats the puppy nice give him a treat. If he's mean repeat the above.<br>  <br>  Show him how the puppy is to be treated and eventually he will understand. <br>  <br>  And always be consistant with your son. He will thank you someday.
tvtc73vDaa	these are simply signs that you are nine months pregnant. they are not indicators of labor. sorry
14RzmDTmaa	it could be implantaion, i would wait three days and test. good luck.
ZobeHnRuaa	It sounds like you're having contractions.  If you haven't reported all of these symptoms to your doctor already, I would suggest that you do it immediately.  I had the same exact symptoms when pregnant with my 2nd child and was born 9 weeks early.  Because it didn't feel like the labor pains I had with my first, I didn't think anything about it and just dealt with it.  Little did I know I was in labor and by the time I went to the doctor to get it checked out, I was dialated to 6 and had to have an emergency c-section because he was still breech.  Always better to be safe than sorry.|`|XQuprZxUaa	You are probably having braxton hicks contractions. They are said to not really hurt but when I was pregnant they hurt. They woke me up because they were so strong. I also am pregnant right now and the back pain and the menstral pains are the same for me too. It is normal just not comforting. You should be fine if you need to contact a nurse hotline and ask them for more advice|`|uQc4UA2Caa	yes my girl has been head down since 27 too im now nearly 32 weeks an the pressure is getting heavier im glad its her head not feet.<br>  the pains are normal too.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	It is ok...

It depends how old you are too. <br>  I'm 18 and these are some of the things I do:<br>  <br>  - Surprise him with his favorite dinner.<br>  - Surprise him with any food at all I guess (lol). Guys love food!<br>  - Send him a sweet text to let him know you're thinking about him or write him a little note<br>  - Help him when he's working on something. Homework, projects, building something, etc.<br>  - Offer to do things for him (such as get him a drink, go get his coat, etc)<br>  - Scratch or rub his back.<br>  - Plan a special day for the two of you. Keep it a surprise so it makes him wonder! It's always fun that way!<br>  <br>  Just make sure he knows he is loved and appreciated everytime he goes to sleep.|`|Na1HDNncaa	do random things for him, like bake his favorite cookies (or buy them, w/e) take a day to do something he likes to do(like if he ever said he likes to go paintballin well go with him), text him flirty/funny texts when your in class to let him knw you're thinking about him(like an inside joke or something) when he's having a bad day listen to him and give him backrubs,when you walk with him holding hands give his hand a little squeeze and smile up at him or things like that. just think of things that you knw will make him happy and do it. it doesnt have to be anything big..just little details that show him you care too.<br>  <br>  hope this helped. good luck! =]|`|7810472dea4ef476f08e138148939625aa	just notice and acknowlege his wants/needs. i did this and me and my bf are very happy! our relationship is getting better with each day :)...and um dont fight over silly little things...like ermm idk. stuff that wont matter a year from now!

I try to do as much as I can for my boyfriend... when he has a bad day, since he lives close, he just comes over to my house and I give him a backrub and he talks about it and I listen. That really doesn't seem so boyfriend-girlfriendy does it? It's more of a friendship thing. The basis of a really good relationship is being best friends, so maybe try just letting him talk to you about things that are bothering him and be a good listener. EVERYONE appreciates that, regardless of your relationship to them.|`|I64JOuMKaa	surprise him afterschool?<br>  walk with him home, take him to the cornerstore/gas station buy him a little snack as your treat.<br>  <br>  text him during last block and tell him you're gunna take him out to eat after school ! to like Idunno somewhere to eat Mcdonalds etc to just talk and see whatsup!<br>  <br>  Text him during class<br>  call him every night<br>  walk him to some of his classes / he walks you to some of yours<br>  eat lunch with him offer to pay sometimes, not only guys pay !<br>  Take him out on the weekend for achange instead of you taking him out.<br>  Have a guys day, instead of going all girly all the time, let him teach you how to play his favorite video game and just hang out : )<br>  Take him to the movies, watch a movie of his choice instead of a chick flick haha, maybe a scary movie, that way you get to cuddle with him too : ) <br>  Leave him notes in his locker =P!<br>  <br>  good luck : )
i7vCTOnaaa	nope, if you got your period then you are safe from being pregnant. although make SURE it is your period and not bleeding due to pregnancy. some women bleed when pregnant because they are having a miscarriage, and some women bleed and their baby is still just fine. so make sure its your period and not pregnancy related.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	no darling.

2HETgiwgaa	When you first start getting periods, they can be irregular ie there can be a lot of variation in the length of your menstrual cycle.  You may want to note on a calendar when you get it, and then after a while you may see a pattern - this will help you predict when your next one is due.  The number of days in your cycle is calculated by counting from the first day when you have enough blood to need a tampon or pad until the day before your next period starts.  All women are different, and a normal cycle length (for adults) can be anything from 21 days to 35 days (or even as long as 45 days).  You might find the link below helpful.|`|d5K8wORqaa	beinggirl.com|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Average periods can last 3 days to 7 days.<br>  Mine used to stop at 3 days for almost the whole day and then start again the next day for a day and a half.|`|3Yfp3QUfaa	how old are you?

But keep in mind that it is generally recommended that car seats be replace every 2 to 3 years and it might be best to purchase a new one.<br>  <br>  EDIT: mom, car seats often come with a base and instructions to use without, size and seat shape of various cars make it impossible to universally fit to all.  If a car seat has a removable base and an alternative way to strap into a car then you should be save to assume it is save to use that way.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	Wait, so you removed the base to use it in your car and you wanna know if its safe to use without the base in a van? If it was safe in the car, its probably safe in the van. if not, i bought an extra base from walmart.com for my carseat for about $30. First I would take it to the local fire dept and have them look at it installed in the van. they will be able to tell you if it is safe|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Generally its fine to not use the base, it can be better in even a large vehicle depending on the angle of the car's seat.<br>  <br>  Check that the carseat isn't expired which is usually 5-10 years depending on the brand.  Replacing seats every 2-3 years is insane.<br>  <br>  PS to the first answer its safe to use the carseat without the infant pillow but you seats either have it or don't, its not an option

It's the pregnancy bible.<br>  <br>  Don'ts: Don't do anything physically strenuous, hard labor, anything where you put yourself in a situation to get hurt. Don't eat raw meat and such... Try to bend down at your knees and squat when picking stuff up.

ApyrV5J9aa	I took a pregnancy test two days before my period was supposed to start. At first I saw nothing. I came back a few minutes later and swore I saw the faintest of lines. My husband and I had to hold it real close to our eyes and pull it away to figure out if our eyes were playing tricks on us. I certainly was pregnant and a blood test later that day confirmed it. False positives are VERY rare so if there is a line within 10 minutes of using the test, even if it is barely there, it is still a positive. Congrats. Call your doctor and request a blood test to confirm.|`|UNWLaJbKaa	I took a test at 9dpo and it was negative, and I took one today at 11dpo and it was so faint, but I could def see it.  You know what a negative looks like. You won't even have to second guess it.  Just a blank, white strip starring back at ya.  So that faint line is there because it's detecting pregnancy hormones :) within the required testing time limit.  It's faint because your hormones are low, but try again like you said in a few days, and good luck to you.|`|eHlPh9Cmaa	Its very common to get a faint positive in early pregnancy and false positives are very rare. So if you tested positive then make an appointment with your doctor and get a blood test done.|`|DN6XtoViaa	yes this happened to me... i was using the tests you buy off the internet and kept getting very faint positives like yours. i wasn't pregnant however and those test are just VERY prone to getting evap lines almost right away! <br>  i wouldn't get to excited until you get a bold positive.. not one your not sure is there or not. <br>  <br>  or save yourself the heartach and get a blood test :) <br>  i went through hell with those faint positives! and i would really hate for other people to get that and not be pregnant!!<br>  <br>  good luck and i really hope you are!!!|`|S1gJJHNzaa	what kind of test are you using?  makes all the difference.

It's so cute. You could always call her Mia as well. Ava Marie reminds me of Ave Maria, which is such a beautiful song. It's a very lovely name. I also love the name Rebecca, but not so much with Susanne. I would do Rebecca Grace (can you tell I like the name grace?) or Rebecca Elizabeth. <br>  <br>  Good luck! Your names are wonderful.|`|VFTArdQxaa	Ava Marie, and Amelia Grace. <br>  <br>  Your going to hate me!

281bc9a14a2a3c5832ce389a1258dda1aa	You can take your baby out whenever your ready. I have a 5 year old and 2 month old, both were outside within the 1st week. I just wouldn't let every random person touch them etc, It is a myth that a baby can't go out older people still believe it. If anything its the mother that needs to stay home a little while to give her body a chance to heal.Also agreeing with another answerer the 2nd child does go out more just because there is so much going on. I pick my older son up from school everyday.|`|6RkLr3Uaaa	Im sorry , being baptised doesnt stop nasty things from happening , good parenting does , be smart , wear proper clothes for the wether , take enough bottles/food/blankets etc ... I had my son out and about when he was just 24 hrs old , we HAD to go out because not only do I have a life , I have other children to concider .... i Have never heard of such rubbish ....'you cant take a child out to the great outdoors ' what a better place is there for them to be nourished by the light and in the fresh air...<br>  the child will be fine ...if not he will thrive being in an environment that encourages him to explore , the grass is fine to be on , as long as he doesnt pick up things like dog pooh....|`|KRQtXHwIaa	If I had my way I would hibernate in my house rather then pack kids around lol. With that said I don't think there is anything wrong with taking a baby outside or to the store. My younger ones were packed around from the day they were born since we had older ones with busier schedules. It won't hurt them.|`|dMLLQruOaa	Yes its fine. I would just make sure to have the baby dressed for the weather and steer clear of germ infested places like schools where children's hands are all over the baby. Not that i dont love children, i work with young ones and germs fly everywhere around them. Some babies that may have Jondice are accually encouraged to be taken on a nice sunny walk.|`|5jT9cO2haa	My husband and I took our baby out the first week he was born and he is a happy and healthy 10 week old now. Our outings were short, maybe an hour or two just to get out of the house and fresh air, but I don't see the problem with spending time at your mother's home for a few hours.|`|v0QWwmwGaa	Good  question..... I was wondering the same.... My husband tells me i cant take the baby out anywhere not for a long time... not even to my moms.... but he says onces he is  baptized he can... but 6 weeks is stil early...  maybe  just to my moms ...i would wait a lil longer...|`|kDz9gcMuaa	Its actually good for the baby cause the sun gives off natural light and the baby intakes vitamins to help the skin so it can help the baby become more use to the sun. How else do plants grow like us light and water.|`|fJTjE8j8aa	My mom took me out when i was a day old... just don't drop the baby lol|`|Ope6KuZ7aa	I expect a parent of more than one child would have to leave the house sooner than later!  I hear pediatricians recommending limited public exposure for the first two weeks.  I think public places...where people will be interacting and touching the baby would pose the biggest concern due to hand hygiene and the possibility of immature immune system.  I don't think an outing with baby would pose a risk if the weather was mild and the baby is not exposed to prolonged direct sunlight.  Shade, hoods and bonnets for the first 2 months and then sunscreen after that.  If you had to go shopping or out amongst many people, perhaps using a sling would keep well meaning people from touching a baby without your permission.|`|JxPw8OaHaa	Taking the baby outside is good in moderation from what I have learned.  It helps develop their immune system, causes their bodies to create antibodies against common germs.  Each parent makes that decision for their child, talk to the pediatrician and dont let others opinions sway what you feel is safe for your child.|`|XQuprZxUaa	From the time my sons were first born they went out of the house.

It's ok to take them out of the house.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	What does being baptised have to do with being on the grass?!<br>  <br>  It's fine to take a baby out before 6 weeks, you take them into the outside world when they come home from hospital, and you can't put them in a sterile bubble for the first few months of their lives.|`|EyKJ737daa	back in the "old days" they use to make mums stay in hospital for 2 weeks as well.  Things have so changed thank god!  Studies I guess have shown that babies are not better for being wrapped in cotton wool from such an early age.  as long as precautions are taken when going outside, example dressing for the appropriate weather, then baby is perfectly fine to go outside or wherever mum wants to take them.  I know with my first, after a week at home, I was climbing the walls to get out of the house, anywhere, I didn't care. My second though i was out within the week and taking her shopping with me.  As for my 3rd, I got stuck in hospital for almost a week with her because i got thrombosis, but as soon as I was discharged, i couldn't wait to get out and see something different.  It's really up the mum too, as long as she feels comfortable going out with bub, then bub will feel comfortable too. Do what you want to do sweetie, that's what's the "norm" :-) All the best for your big day xx<br>  <br>  Edit:I agree with a few other posters, what has being baptised or not have to do with anything?!  You still have to take your baby outside to the baptism don't you?!|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	Seriously, can you imagine being trapped in the house for 6 weeks because its not considered normal? What do you think single parents do, or people with spouses in the military? You gotta do what you gotta do. If you need to go to the grocery store, its not going to kill a baby to go with you. Just take hand sanitizer for yourself and ask googling onlookers not to touch.|`|WPI0Z47saa	I took my son out the first week.

8kaDm2D8aa	i used soy with my daughter.  i started out breast feeding & switching from my milk to cow's milk grossed me out.  she has never had any problem with spitting up, ever.  personally, i think cow's milk is for baby cow's not baby humans.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	lactose free.. you should rely read about soy, we have soooo many hormomes pumped in our foods that soy is actually bad for you. There is sooo much estrogen in soy.  Its not good for western diets|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	<a href="http://askdrsears.com/html/0/T000100.asp#T031007" rel="nofollow">http://askdrsears.com/html/0/T000100.asp...</a><br>  SOY FORMULAS<br>  <br>  Even though around 25 percent of formula-fed American babies take some form of soy formula, we recommend that parents begin their baby on a standard cow's milk-based formula unless advised otherwise by their doctor. Soy formulas became popular as an alternative formula in infants who are allergic to cow's milk. Some babies are less allergic to the soy protein than to cow's milk protein. Yet, we have the following reservations about soy formulas:<br>  <br>      * Even though soy-based artificial baby milks may be less allergenic for some babies, between 30 and 50 percent of infants who are allergic to cow's milk are also allergic to soy.<br>      * There is no precedent in nature for feeding young mammals a plant-based protein. In the early 1970s it was discovered that soy proteins are deficient in some amino acids that babies need. For this reason, methionine, carnitine, and taurine have to be added from other sources. Not only is soy protein deficient in some amino acids because plant protein in general does not provide the same growth equivalent as animal protein, but more needs to be added so that soy formulas have a higher level of this protein to make up for its lesser quality. According to the amino acid profile, at least in All-Soy, there is no carnitine or taurine. Even though current biochemical knowledge has fixed some of the previous problems with soy protein for babies, we are still tampering with Mother Nature's recipe, leading us to conclude that feeding soy protein to growing babies is still experimental. Plant protein is a good protein for older infants and adults, but the protein made by big mammals for little mammals is ideal for babies.<br>      * Another problem with soy is that the protein itself contains phytates, substances that bind calcium and phosphorus. To prevent calcium deficiencies and consequent deficiencies in bone mineralization, the calcium content of soy formulas is generally 20 to 30 percent higher than the calcium content of milk- based formulas.<br>      * These phytates also bind iron and zinc. As a result of this finding, artificial soy baby milks, such as Carnation, Allsoy, and Mead Johnson's Prosobee, have added extra iron and zinc. Isomil's Soy formula (made by Ross Laboratories) does not have more zinc or iron than the company's cow's-based formulas. Studies done by Ross Laboratories show that the blood-mineral profile of babies on cow's milk and soy formulas are no different.<br>      * In 1996 the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics voiced some concern about the relatively high content of aluminum in soy-based formulas and the possible toxicity to infants. Although the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that the elevated aluminum levels in some soy formulas do not seem to be harmful for term infants, the fact is no one really knows. Because of this worry and studies showing less bone mineralization in preterm infants on soy formula, the Committee of Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that soy formula be reserved for term infants and not be used for preterm or small-for-date infants.<br>      * Soy formula was once routinely recommended for infants with a family history of milk allergy in hopes of preventing allergies from developing. Research has failed to support the idea that starting a newborn on soy formula will decrease the later incidence of allergy. Also, recent research has disproven the belief that babies are less colicky with soy formulas. Studies comparing cow's milk- based and soy formula showed that soy formula does not lower the risk of infant colic. For this reason, the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against the use of soy formulas in the routine management of colic or in infants who are potentially allergic to cow's milk. Instead of soy, hypoallergenic formulas are recommended.<br>      * Giving an infant soy in the early months before intestinal closure may predispose the infant to soy allergies later on. Since soy is used as a filler in so many foods in the American diet, this is a serious concern.<br>      * Soy formulas contain around 33 percent more sodium than standard cow's milk- based formulas, and formulas in general are saltier than human milk. It is nutritionally unwise to shape young palates to get accustomed to salty tastes. It's unwise to give a baby a salty formula unless absolutely necessary.<br>      * Carbohydrate sources in soy formulas are even more of a concern. Just as there is a whey war going on between formula companies, there now seems to be a sugar war, too. Enfamil now advertises "no table sugar" in their soy formula, Prosobee, so they use corn syrup instead of sucrose. Does this make a big difference? Some nutritionists might prefer plain old table sugar to corn syrup. Corn itself is an allergen, and corn syrup is very sweet.<br>      * Because soy formulas are made with bean "milk" and not cow's milk, they are naturally lactose-free. The problem is that lactose is the sugar in human milk and in the milk of all other mammals. There is no basis in nature for feeding mammals lactose-free milk. Lactose is an intestinal-friendly sugar, enhancing calcium absorption and helping to colonize those little intestines with favorable bacteria. While the "lactose-free" nature of soy formulas benefit infants who are congenitally lactose intolerant (which is really quite rare in the first year of life), this is really tampering with Mother Nature. Because soy does not contain lactose, soy formulas are often recommended for infants who develop a temporary lactase deficiency following an intestinal infection. Studies as to whether or not this helps show mixed results. The American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend the routine use of soy formulas in infants recovering from diarrhea, but suggests they be used only in babies shown to be temporarily intolerant of cow's milk-based formulas. <br>  <br>  Our conclusion: Unless recommended otherwise by your baby's doctor, soy formulas:<br>  <br>      * Should not be routinely used in infants with a family history of milk allergy in hopes of preventing later allergy.<br>      * Should not be as a substitute for cow's milk-based formulas unless baby has been proven to be allergic to cow's milk-based formulas.<br>      * Should not be used to prevent or treat "colic" unless advised by your doctor.<br>      * Should not be used in preterm or small-for-date babies. <br>  <br>  Even though we discourage the use of soy formula as a first-choice artificial baby milk, in some babies it is a necessary alternative to cow's milk-based formulas. Many of the objections to soy formula are perhaps more theoretical than practical (since studies have shown that healthy term babies grow just as well on soy as they do on cow's-milk-based formulas). It's what we do not know about soy that concerns us. The soy bean protein brings along with it a lot of other phytochemicals (plant nutrients), some of which may be healthful, and others we just don't know about. Cow's-milk-based formulas have been around for nearly a century. We don't have that much experience with soy, so be cautious.<br>  Back to top<br>  SPECIAL FORMULAS FOR SPECIAL PROBLEMS<br>  <br>  Special formulas are those in which one of the basic nutrients (usually the protein and/or carbohydrate) has been changed to an alternative nutrient that an individual baby may better tolerate. When formula shopping, be sure not to make a change to these specialty formulas without your doctor's advice. Specialty formulas:<br>  <br>      * are usually much more expensive<br>      * usually taste bitter to downright bad because the technology required to predigest (hydrolyze) the protein into more easily-digestible units results in a more bitter-tasting protein<br>      * The nutritional quality of the changed or absent nutrient may be less than in standard formulas.<br>      * Less is known about the long-term effects of feeding babies these special formulas. In other words, all formulas are experimental, but some are more experimental than others. <br>  <br>  The following are the most popular specialty formulas at this writing: Lactose-free formulas (e.g., Lacto-free, Mead Johnson) are an example of new formula products that are driven more by market demand than scientific sense. Many formula-fed babies (and breastfed babies, too) get fussy, resulting in what we call the formula parade: switching from one formula to another until either something works or the baby's intestines mature and he outgrows the problem. Whatever formula you're using at the time gets the credit. The fact is that oftentimes baby's fussiness is not due to the formula, but to other unrelated causes. Nevertheless, formula gets the blame, so factories step up with new varieties to keep up with the demand. Hence lactose- free formulas.<br>  <br>  Lactose-intolerance is over-diagnosed in babies (as it is in adults). It's easy to blame formula, and therefore lactose, for baby's fussiness. Think for a moment. If so many babies are lactose-intolerant, why would lactose be the sugar in human milk? True, human milk also contains the enzyme lactase that helps babies absorb the lactose, whereas formula does not, but milk lactase doesn't do the whole job. It does seem that nature would provide the intestines of nearly all babies with enough lactose to get through at least a year or so of milk-feeding (lactose is only present in dairy products and not other foods).<br>  <br>  The main difference in lactose-free formula is that the lactose sugar has been replaced by other sugars, usually corn syrup and sucrose (table sugar). The protein and fat blend is the same as in cow's milk-based formulas. The biochemist who dreams up the formula believes that sugar is sugar, and substituting corn syrup and sucrose for lac|`|rqKRZOCVaa	I had a milk allergy growing up also and my son did just fine on Lactose-Free enfamil its in a purple can.

It's just your uterus preparing itself.|`|uuHPneEcaa	Yeah u are okay.. some people morning sickness is in the morning some in the evening  some at night and some people it last all day (like my sister) ITs normal.. Just drink water and I am sure ur going to be fine. and the cramping is because the baby is making room for its self. So u are okay I am sure. <br>  <br>  If u have too I am sure ur doc can procribe something to help with ur neausia|`|LY2LSzPJaa	It is called mourning sickness , as in mourning somthing , not morning as in time of day. You can have it anytime. I had it had night with both pregnancies. <br>  Also the cramping is normal too , as long as it isnt servre , and yes it is just your stomache adjusting , that will go away in the next month im sure.|`|AhXl6kflaa	u could have this sickness until you are at least 14 weeks every ones body is different take it from me im 19 weeks now and sometimes i still get nauseated and the cramping is part of the baby get ready but if it gets very severe u might want to go see a doctor|`|oltCj6Kcaa	Unfortunately "morning sickness" can happen at any time of day. Be glad it's not lasting ALL DAY. And for most it doesn't last the whole pregnancy...just the 1st 13 weeks or so.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats.
i8ulZJroaa	Damion, it is more masculine. ?|`|QWTLw9DEaa	I don't like Stone at all. It's a thing...<br>  Damien, which I prefer spelled that way, I love. Great choice!|`|Ni4aaXTFaa	Stone is cool.|`|nyTVdVPqaa	I  really like the name Stone. Damion is a good name too but I personalyy would spell it Damien because the other pronuncation sounds really posh when you read it out how it si written.|`|X7YMZwW8aa	Stone? i don't really like that name, I'd go with Damion.
XqfSDTKkaa	OH god.....it's like I was reading something out of my own life! I have twin 2 year olds and one of them has ALWAYS been daddys boy. Does the same thing your kid does. However when daddy isnt here he is very loving to me. but if daddy is anywhere in sight he becomes a little monster! cries, screams, throws fits, just wants to cuddle and be with daddy, wont even give me a kiss if he's there. I know he loves me and my sons reason is that his dad does spoil him and gives him everything he wants. Was he always like this or only after you came back from the visit? If this is a new thing, Im sure it will die down with time. you and your husband reassure him that when mommy or daddy goes that at the end of the day they will always come back and be together again. Im sure this is a phase and he'll grow out of it.|`|CnLL5ENmaa	omg...my son totally is!  I stay at home with him all day, so when my BF comes home, he wants it to be all daddy time!  I've just recently been sick for 3 weeks and he stayed home to take care of him, and if I came into the room he would run away to his daddy! haha|`|ADTtYII0aa	My 6 yr. old is a total daddy's boy. I always say he bleeds his daddy's blood, only because I've never seen someone his age care like that. It makes it particularly hard since were not together and his daddy doesn't come around like he should. He actually got kicked out of his preschool because he was having such bad separation anxiety. Have thanks it's not like that for you. I kills me to see him like that, and nothing I do helps.|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	Oh hon don't worry so much! it is a phase i promise. though my children DO get excited when my husband is home it does taper off a bit.<br>  My oldest was this way, my middle son was a momma's boy but had his 'daddy's boy' phase, my daughter is a huge daddy's girl, and my youngest has just started this.<br>  <br>  It's just natural that they are so clingy when he gets home. he's not been there all day and all the sudden Daddy's home! it's an exciting moment. i know you probably are glad to see your hubby come home too, it's just Xs 10 for kids. <br>  One thing you can do is take him somewhere special a few times a month so you can spend some good quality time w/him building a great mommy/baby bond. i usually take mine to the big park down town one time, then we go for ice cream after lunch the next, then maybe a trip to the children's museum the next time. don't let it get to you too much, he's not forgotten about you at all...you're mommy! you will always be mommy, he's just missing daddy during the day and wants to build a bond w/him as well. it's completely normal. i think most kids do this.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  it can last for a long while. their personalities begin to form and change. it's natural i swear. my youngest likes for my husband to put him down to sleep as well.|`|ijDfRIyoaa	I dont have a son but my daughter becomes instantly attached to anyone who spends 15 minutes with her, she is going to be a people person haha (she is 2)<br>  but she is deffinately a daddy's girl :( I hope my next daughter is a mumm's girl~|`|UYfqzCoMaa	It's a phase. My son did the same thing. He still switches around. One week he wants nothing to do with daddy. It's all about mommy. then the next week he wants daddy. Part of it is that I am home with him all day long so he gets excited when daddy comes home because he works a lot so they don't get to see him a lot every day. Maybe for an hour or two.|`|EeGgovyCaa	My son and daughter pretty cling to anyone who spends more than an hour with them :) But at the end of the day, he's a mommy's boy and she is a daddy's girl.
uuHPneEcaa	u could be getting ready to start or my may be pregnant. Just take a pregnancy test and u will know right then and there. I waited until I was 5 days late and it came back positive. I felt the same way u do except I have a very big appite.. best of luck to u<br>  <br>  (I am sure ur pregnant, I did feel the same way and i took a EPT and it came out LOUD AND CLEAR two lines (which means ur pregnant) )<br>  <br>  I was just like u and I am telling u!! lol yay ur gonna be a momma!|`|mbvpWNMeaa	All of these symptoms are consistent with early pregnancy.|`|RXeuiz95aa	I'm pretty sure you're pregnant!<br>  <br>  Can't be 100% sure until you take a test though.<br>  <br>  If you are; congratulations/good luck!<br>  <br>  [:|`|JGvSQOrhaa	you could be prego or maybe you just want to be prego so bad that you are having the symptoms. That happens a lot. It does sound like you could be though. take that test and good luck to you!|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	you sound like me...<br>  my period was due monday though. cigs make me sick as well<br>  that how i knew with my first. just the smell of alcohol or cigarette made me sick. take a test with your first morning urine.<br>  <br>  good luck!
nwuL7M7saa	Take a pregnancy test.|`|yC4REA3waa	test|`|B0ypUuHXaa	Take a pregnancy test! Good luck!|`|HJe7ln7gaa	Wait till your next period is due. If your period is usually late, I'd suggest you wait another week from the day you should have got your period and if it still does not show, take a home pregnancy test. The best one to use is the Early Detection Pregnancy Test which you sould preferrably take with your early morning urine as your HCG level is at the highest at this time of the day. If the test comes out negative and your period still does not show, wait another 3-4 days and then take the test again. If it still comes out negative, then I'd suggest you go see your doctor.<br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|6TQFahm4aa	You should definately take a test.  If you are even 1 day late you can usually tell.  I am 18 weeks pregnant, and i spotted the first couple of weeks of my pregnancy.  Good Luck|`|u1lcZZYfaa	Take a test. its simple
I64JOuMKaa	well I guess the only thing you can do is<br>  study really really really hard for the test coming up<br>  and try and get 100% <br>  and if that works<br>  <br>  convince your mom that since you did so good on that test that you want to hang out with your friends on the weekend as a reward, but that you promise you will sttill study.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|AusPef8Yaa	You need a positive attitude towards it in order to have a positive outcome.<br>  Listen to your mom and just do your best.|`|pcjOQDymaa	ok so heres the answer.<br>  study and follow your moms rules.<br>  its not that hard. honestly.
nY1nq9hCaa	He is at an age where he is sexual aware.  To avoid any situations that may cause trouble, it is time to teach him do not leave it to schools to teach him sexual education because it is still in the dark ages.  You can get books from book stores and i am sure your local GP or family clinic can give you information and condoms etc to show him and how to use.<br>  <br>  The fact you may be showing him condoms worries you, think it this way its better to be safer than sorry.  Face facts that they are getting younger when experimenting with sex.  At least you have given your on a head start and be assured that he is not ignorant if anything was to happen.<br>  <br>  I am sure he will not run off and try his new found information, i am sure his common sense will kick in to know what is right and wrong.<br>  <br>  It is good to cover all aspects so there is no room for having to seek to find out.  Let him explain how he feels, he may be embarrassed about taking your underwear.  Do not lie to him to any of his questions because this will cause more problems.  Take it from your conversation with him to choose which direction to take it.<br>  <br>  If it is more worrying seek professional advise.<br>  <br>  Seek professional advice on the best way to approach your young teen.|`|bxlYleZkaa	If you have left it until he is ten years old then you have left it ten years too late!! Sex education along with ALL forms of education begins at birth!!! Would you wait until he was 10 before you taught him to read, walk, swim, or how to ride a bicycle? No! Then why leave ANY part of his education until then?|`|c2kopbo6aa	get naked and start pointing out body parts....jk...<br>  talk to him....its easy to avoid the embarassing situations but it needs to be done, plus its good practice to break the ice now...you should make it comfortable so when he is a teenager he will come and ask you things..|`|rsFWSelnaa	the thing about being a female is we dont know what it is like to be a 10 yr old,  boy .  Its all about curiosity, dont be alarmed, my sister found a dead bird in her son's drawers, at that age, she learned never to look in his drawers again.  he grew up without a bird fetish.|`|5VdB8njTaa	Your gonna have to sit him down and tell him straight, the last thing you want is his sexual education coming from his buddies at school and innuendo from TV.|`|n7uoE9wmaa	I agree with JBs mommy|`|zFhhgL0Oaa	i am a crossdresser and have done the same thing since i was like 7, dont worry if he is a crossdresser it doesnt mean he is gay... i still love woman only... i hope i dont freak you on my answer...   keep an eye on your clothes....... want to really find out ask him if he wants to be a monster for halloween or a girl...  good luck

oOly8Wj2aa	According to the World Health Organisation's 2001 report, condoms treated with the spermicide Nonoxynol-9 are no more-likely to prevent pregnancy nor the spread of STDs than condoms which are lubricated but not spermicidal.<br>  <br>  When used correctly, condoms have up to a 98% success rate (based on consistent usage for a year). Therefore, if you're using just condoms, done right, and you have sex for a year, there's about a 2% chance of conception. This chance can be affected by inconsistent or improper condom use, as well as by condoms treated by an effective spermacide, or by use of an additional method of birth control (such as the contraceptive pill).
V8wUAVdyaa	go ahead and call now just to see what they say about it.. thats what they are there for.  I called after I felt contractions for only one hour just to see what they said.|`|yB5go5wbaa	No, don't call until they're about 7 minutes apart and you can't talk through them.  No sense in going in unless you're really in labor.|`|1Tdkb8OGaa	Why are you on Y!A for this?I suggest you call a doctor.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	When its about 10 minutes apart.. call 911 or just go to the hospital. Babies come when they want the doctor can only guess at it.  When I had my first baby I started contractions at midnight.. went in at 6am they said I wasn't having the baby that day and sent me home at 8am.. at 11am I was back had the baby 45 minutes later.. they really don't know its all guess work.|`|8oAlBL91aa	You are supposed to call the doctor when the contractions are 5 minutes apart.|`|0iUxfCMcaa	yes|`|Oq2B7I4faa	You are in your early stage of labor when contractionsa are 5 minutes apart and last about 60 seconds.  However you said that you are not due till next month, so I would be worried and call doctor if not I would go to hospital to the labor and delivery department.|`|vhuqAqNdaa	5 mins between each and your in real labour, unless your waters break then you should go. no waters could be harmful for the baby.<br>  <br>  you really are better off staying at home as long as you can, a days labour in a hospital is not nice, have a warm bath !|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I don't understand when you are due? If you are preterm then don't wait. Call now. The labor can be stopped, but they need adaquat time. If you are full term 37 weeks or more, then wait until they're very close together.|`|kyqhMuSiaa	It may be braxton-hicks contractions which are irregular. Real contractions will start coming at regular intervals and increase in intensity. If concerned see your doc but my advice is stay at home where it's comfy for as long as you can.  Good luck|`|kVIOtS5gaa	Contractions are expected at this stage of pregnancy, don't psych yourself out. Unless your contractions are 5 min apart or your water breaks there's no reason to get worked up.|`|AA11542929	wait i am having the same things.. its uncomfortable but ima wait a lil and if they get closer then ima go.. give them til they are 5 mins apart.. good luck and congrats|`|C9C9EAyiaa	It never hurts too call too many times. Better safe than sorry.|`|WNn8WDPHaa	You should call your doctor to be on the safe side.. immediately|`|XIuQyB7oaa	The best thing for you to do right now, is to try and relax, if you get upset or anxious you could actually put your baby in distress, so calm down, have a cup of coffee, have a nap and when the contractions are 20 min apart, then you go straight to the hospital. Make sure you have someone with you now, because you may need them. Good luck with your new baby.|`|AA11830777	Call the doctor. You shouldn't wait. If it's false whats the worse that can happen?

Wait until you should get your period...if you don't, take a test. If you do get your period, your not pregnant.|`|7jXChfBNaa	i think that for one it would be way to soon to take the test and i don't think you would be pregnant if you used a condom, they are pretty stong and the guy would know when he took it off if it had broke or not.<br>  so i wouldn't worry about it. you should get on birth control as well as using condoms though just in case.|`|ULo8Cwdfaa	if you miss your period, take another test.|`|VFIF4zpAaa	You tested a lil to soon. women usually don't find out that fast. Maybe you should wait and see if you get ur period or not. <br>  <br>  ~Jesus is Love~
g7wQij2Oaa	unfortunately, i don't think you are able to choose your own punishment. otherwise it wouldnt be much of a punishment. a punishment is something that you don't want, so if you wanna get spanked and i was your mom, that would be the last thing i would do!<br>  <br>  :)|`|bxlYleZkaa	I think you will find there are laws against it, unfortunately.|`|Zb7CtLxbaa	This is why as you get older, spankings stop.

You get to deal with what your mom gives you!  <br>  Also there aren't laws against spanking, there are laws against child abuse~2 totally different things!!  <br>  If you know what you did wrong and you want to pick your own punishment why don't you get your head on straight quit being a brat and do what is asked of you!|`|a8e2130188e45facab4c16a4a764104caa	You are the child??<br>  She is the mom???<br>  <br>  She makes the decisions.<br>  Though if you really straighten around, some parents would lesson the 2 months to maybe just a month.<br>  <br>  At 13, grounding shouldn't be too bad anyway ... not many places you could go even if you were NOT grounded!!<br>  .

Toddlers love to dip their food in anything -- ketchup, applesauce, salad dressing, etc.  My 18-month-old calls ketchup, syrup, and Ranch dressing "bup," and he has to have them if they're on the table.  ;-)<br>  <br>  I don't remember how old my oldest was when she went through a "sandwich" phase.  If we had meat, veggies, and bread with dinner, I'd turn them into teeny-tiny sandwiches -- one tiny piece of meat with a tiny veggie in between two tiny pieces of bread.  The whole sandwich was smaller than bite-size.  She thought they were great and would eat anything in sandwich form.<br>  <br>  Will he eat tortillas?  You could roll up lots of good things in there to make fajitas, or melt some cheese/meat/veggies inside to make quesadillas.  And the "dip" can be refried beans.<br>  <br>  If he has something he likes (applesauce, yogurt, etc.), try mixing the foods he doesn't like into it.  That can help get him used to the texture while keeping a taste that he already likes.<br>  <br>  As for veggies, try offering them in different forms.  My 18-month-old loves raw veggies -- carrots, celery, and cucumber.  Of course, he prefers to dip them in Ranch dressing or peanut butter, but he'll also eat them plain.  And it took him a while before he was getting much substance from them b/c they're hard to chew, but he's getting the hang of it now.  Or maybe offer canned, no salt added, veggies -- they're softer and easier for little ones to chew.<br>  <br>  Likewise for fruits -- try to find something he hasn't had yet.  Canned fruits have lots of options (esp. if you get the kind in fruit juice and not sugary syrup).  Kiwi, melon, and berries are also big hits at our house.  Try giving him his own slice of pear (if you haven't already) or letting him hold his own banana.<br>  <br>  If you aren't already, try giving him his own bowl/plate/spoon/fork.  Or try offering him bites of food off your plate.  He may start to eat better if you're eating the same thing that he is.<br>  <br>  The key is to just keep offering a variety of healthy foods, and he'll come around again.  Just try not to make a big deal about what he is or isn't eating.  I think 14 months is a typical age for a bit of pickiness, but we've never had a problem turning it around fairly quickly in our house.<br>  <br>  Oh, one other thought -- is it possible that he's teething?  Maybe he doesn't want some of the other foods because they hurt his gums?  Just something to consider...|`|8bfyMD89aa	He may eat different types of rice or pasta than what you have given him. Remember just because you don't like it doesn't mean he won't like it. Orzo is a great pasta when transitioning kids to rice. Also try putting different types of fruit in yogurt sometimes it gets them adjusted to the flavors. Our veggie trick is that it helps him see in the dark. He takes a bite of veggies then we turn off the light and ask if he can see yet. He east them all and laughs the whole time. My little one says he hates spinach but eats it in ravioli or on grilled cheese, quesdillias or in dip.  Have fun with food, they always tell us not to play with your food but when it comes to getting variety in your toddlers diet this is the exception.|`|nnYW2jVYaa	toast with peanut butter or sugar and cinnamon.|`|P2PIjxsBaa	my son is 16 months old and wont eat any veg ..i keep giving it to him but he keeps throwing it on the floor. but he love friut so i dont let it bother me ..if he eats it then good if he doesnt then im not too bothered

You really can't overfeed a breastfed baby especially meaning they are getting different amounts of calories each time unlike a formula fed baby. His weight will probably plateau later on, and won't gain as rapidly. It's pretty common for babies to gain a lot, and then stop gaining for a while and then gain more slowly later on.|`|vOFdHvlvaa	U can't really overfed a newborn, they will stop eatin when they are full and if u they do over eat they just spit it up.  I would say if the pediatrician says he's gaining good weight then he's fine, and as u said he's just a big boy.  Don't worry about what the nurses say, the pediatrician knows more of what he is talkin about then the nurses do (not sayin the nurses don't know about babies)lol, but some of them are just annoyin when they things like this, esp. when the pediatrician says he's doin fine.<br>  Hope this helps and good luck with ur big baby boy, lol, :D.|`|WoxMH0wZaa	Relax, you can't overfeed a baby. Babies are not like adults, they eat only when they are hungry and stop when they are full. As long as your baby keeps eating, keep on giving him food, when he doesn't want food anymore, then stop. It just sounds like he's a big growing boy :]|`|EeGgovyCaa	When he starts becoming more mobile, he'll thin out quickly.

Have you talked to your pedi?|`|lGrcLQ49aa	Newborns should eat on demand - if the doctor is OK with his weight then it is OK - and I would tell the doctor what the nurse said - it is not her place to share opinions.<br>  <br>  Keep nursing - and many blessings to you and your new one.|`|ADTtYII0aa	I had my son 6 weeks ago.

You can go to free clinics in your area to be tested as well. A blood test may be more conclusive than a urine test.<br>  By your symptoms, I would guess that pregnancy is a good possibility, as that's what I experienced when I got pregnant. It could also be just a few symptoms of a late period, that will eventually show up. Or it could be a medical problem totally unrelated. <br>  I would suggest taking the pregnancy test, and seeing a doctor if it is negative.|`|AA10153923	Sometimes the best thing to do is take a test.<br>  You might just be pregnant, but we can not tell you for sure.<br>  All you can really do is get the test.<br>  Good Luck and Congrats if you are!|`|LqpNve02aa	a month late and your asking strangers for advice.

6Z4fKZ8aaa	I've been TTC for 29 periods & 29 months at 22.  BFN 12/18/2006 @ 19. BFN 10/30/2008 @ 21. Two false pregnancies.  LMP was 2/2/2009.  Been having cramping but it's different from my period cramping. Been having headaches. Threw up a few days ago. Woke up feeling like I wanted to throw up at 5:54 AM today and this lasted while I was taking a shower this morning as well.  I think I threw up in my mouth. I feel different this month and feel like I'm not going to get my period this month.  7 days late according to mymonthycycles.com.  My periods are every 28 days.  I'm not going to waste a test. I'm going to wait until the end of this month, and then test if I don't get my period.|`|WdvLcYaVaa	I am due for af 3/14. I am really thinking about testing tomorrow since I will be 11dpo. At 4dpo I was dizzy and had some pretty bad cramps. I was also weepy that day. The next day I had a few globs of creamy/yellow stretchy cm. Since then it has been clear and very abundant. Saturday and sunday I was crampy all day and it kind of felt like I had a UTI or something (but I know I don't). My boobs have been slightly tender today and I am feeling kind of weepy. I am feeling pretty good about this month, so we will see. baby dust to all..lets hope we start seeing some BFP's!!!!|`|AA10564328	I'm currently in my 2ww.actually its almost up.i had pretty bad pains after i babydanced.my nipples were tingly around 9 dpo.I havent had any symptoms except for weird stomach sensations.I honestly think AF is comming..Its due in 2 days.|`|mZzQQUABaa	It may be time for ME to test, but I'm so scared! (don't want a negative)<br>  <br>  Anywho-here it goes!<br>  <br>  LMP-02/07/2009, cycles avg. 29 days..sometimes 30, which was yesterday! Today is day 31 still NO PERIOD! (hoping this is it)<br>  <br>  My symptoms have been creamy cm since ov.(day 15), fatigue, frequent urination, NO SORE BOOBS...they are usually sore every mo. 3-5 days before AF rears her ugly head...oh and Weepy, I am NEVER weepy over stupid things, this month, I am! Oh, and TMI here......VERY WET *********..EVERYDAY!!! Never happens, usually I dry up! and finally my cervix, that I should NOT be feeling, but was tempted to do so today is high, smooth, and soft on DAY 31 of my usually 29 day cycle!!! I am soooo anxious!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you, and welcome to the TWW torture! lol!<br>  <br>  Take Care!|`|weBOR9YCaa	I am soo scared out of my mind to get another negative. <br>  <br>  AF started 2/14. I started using opk tests cd11. Hubby and I baby danced 2/24, 2/25, 2/28 (2 times), got a positive opt on 3/1 so we baby danced, and we bd on 3/2 as well. on 3/5 about 4 days or so past ovulation, I had what I believe to be implantation bleeding. I was cramping, and had back aches. Well it is now 3/9 and I have no signs except backaches. My cervix seems to be really high if that is an indicator. I will test in the morning which is about 5 days b4 af. But truth be told I will be heart broken if I am not pregnant this cycle.
HoonZJMgaa	well I don't want to upset you because if you are saying this then it seems more than likely you want this child. 7 months is way too far along to be unsure but it is not unheard of. My friend didn't know until 6 months because of bleeding. The bleeding is NOT your period because a period is when your uterus sheds its lining. You need the lining to carry baby. I bled for 3 months and I know what I am talking  about. The flutters may indeed be kicks well they should be by now but it may be because you are over weight you feel them less powerfully than someone else would. I am 20 weeks and just started feeling kicks but I have felt this before so I know the difference. When it is your first child, you tend to feel everything later than someone who has previously had children. Ask for a sonogram. By now they can not only see the baby but know the baby's gender as well. If you are pregnant, God Bless you and the baby and if not, God bless you and good luck ttc!|`|hyp3bvhHaa	I don't believe that being on the contraceptive pill can alter pregnancy test results so if you have done a home pregnancy test and it ts megative then you are not pregnant.<br>  all i can sugggest is go back to the dr at this stage of 28 weeks they would be abe to tell if you were pregnant by feeling for the height of your fundus and palpating your abdomne|`|7z6BWoESaa	I had three periods my first pregnancy so yes it can happen, flutters will turn into kicks real soon if you are that far along so you will def. be able to tell real soon, I hope you have stopped taking the pill as it can cause misscarriage and birth defects, no real way to tell other than go to the Doc and get checked, good luck! and take care|`|Lzt1eIZFaa	By 28 weeks, trust me, you would know the difference between flutters and kicks!  Maybe it depends on how overweight you actually are, because I could see my babies moving in my stomach in all three of my pregnancies.<br>  <br>  I sometimes get flutters in my stomach now, and I've been sterilized for 2 years, so cannot have anymore kids. They feel exactly as they did when I was pregnant, but in my case they ARE gas.  Anyway, you'll get some kind of answers when you go to your Doctors, so try not to worry.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	I don't know for sure, but to me it doesn't sound like you are pregnant. It most likely would have shown up on a test by now, and besides by 28 weeks you would definetly be feeling the baby kicking, and you would know it too. If you still think you are, you could always go in to the doctor and request an ultra sound be done, and that would tell you for sure if there was a baby in there. good luck.
svYiQZUHaa	Well it sounds like you care a lot about her. She sounds a lot like me. I think something may have happened to her. Have you tried talking to her Ex or even her best-friend? I would see if you could get anything out of them. If not try to comfort your sister as best you can. Just take it slowly and make sure she is safe from people and mostly herself.<br>  <br>  <br>  The last thing you want her to do is lock herself up inside.|`|L6acUNBcaa	Something bad happened to her if you ask me. The way she reacted when you scared her, or touched her arm... Not good. If you can, have a close convo with her and try to get to the bottom of it.<br>  <br>  I'm so proud of you for stepping up and trying to help her! I wish there were more people like you.<br>  <br>  Good luck! x|`|7810472dea4ef476f08e138148939625aa	talk 2 her about it...she could have been aboused by a guy or somthing|`|QkC7DsFKaa	thts rough. Im really sorry bout ur sister. Try sitting down and talking to her. Talk to the ones who she used to spend time with. I think, from wat u said, tht she was harrassed or abuse in some form- have u noiced any bruises or marks she cant explain??? I really hope this is just a faze and shell get over it. Try to get in touch with an adult she can really trust who could really help the situation if nessicary. Hope this helps!|`|Wr6k76pZaa	Well i think that if she ended her relationship then maybe he went to the party as well and hurt her, or abused her in some form. Most likely if she not communicating with men a guy proly did something. So i would not jump to conclusions and just tell her that she can trust you with anything and that if anything at all is bothering her then when she is ready she can tell you. Don't push her to tell you because that might make her less wanting to tell, you or anyone at that matter, whats wrong. Im sorry about this and i hope nothing serious happened. <br>  <br>  Oh and i wouldn't go telling your dad or brothers about anything because she will loose trust in you.??|`|GHnkKwl3aa	Something doesn't seem right, she could have been sexually assulted (raped?) at the party.<br>  <br>  Try and talk with her, since you are a boy then talk to her best friend (girl) and get her to talk with your sister to find out what's wrong.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|kRaVa0Wraa	maybe she was sexually abused or even raped.<br>  <br>  or maybe her boyfriend actually broke up with HER and she's sad about it?<br>  <br>  either way, you need to talk to her about it. something is definitely wrong....|`|pcjOQDymaa	oh im so sorry.<br>  honestly i do think something happened at the party.<br>  you need to go and ask her or if she won't talk go to the school and figure it out there.<br>  im sure kids in her grade know.<br>  or maybe she got raped (i know im sorry to say this)<br>  but you can never know.<br>  PLEASE FIND OUT SOON.<br>  i hope she;s ok.|`|6mBpkt3Daa	She may have been sexually abused. That's really what it sounds like. You're very sweet to care about ur sister so much. Ask her what's REALLY wrong. She needs to tell someone. If she was in fact assaulted, then an adult MUST know and get involved with the situation. I'm so sorry about your sister.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	Sounds like something happened to her at the party. The only thing you can do is either ask her or someone who was at the party.|`|Qydtjz2naa	She went to a party, and when she came back, she was afraid of men.  I'm sorry, but it sounds like she was raped, or sexually assaulted in some way.  It isn't nothing.  Yes, we do act different when we PMS, but not in that way.  Talk to her.  She might not tell you what's wrong, but tell her you're always there to listen.  <br>  <br>  This is not something to let pass, she needs your help.  Just say "I have noticed you've been acting different lately.  You're a really great sister to me, I want to be a good big brother and help you.  Do you want to talk?"  It helps a lot if you give her a compliment like that, she might feel better talking to you if she feels you appreciate her.  <br>  <br>  Do not let this go.  Whatever happened, it's affecting your younger sister in a negative way.  That is NOT something to ignore.  It's good that you're concerned about her, that's the first step.  The next is to do something about it.  Just let her know that you love her and care about her.  Try to get her to open to up to you.  She wouldn't be doing these things unless there was something wrong.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	I think something happened at this party.<br>  She could of been abused or even raped.<br>  Definitely ask her. <br>  It's really important that you get her help if something terrible happened.<br>  <br>  Go ask her asap.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped <br>  :)?<br>  <br>  <br>  Relationships dont always just end for no reason. I think something happend that caused her to fear men.<br>   You need to talk to her. See how you can help.|`|1d189d211710842a2fef70f9f5dbf40baa	Definatly talk to her. My guess would be that she was sexually harasses/ abused at this party. if you know for sure that she broke up with her boyfriend, then maybe it has to do with him and her best friend. (?) You never know. Thats really sad though ): Hope things work out. Just do the best you can to get her to talk to you about whats going on.|`|zGWg9RAiaa	Tell an adult you trust immediately.  Don't wait and don't let her talk you out of it.  Don't even tell her.  She may be mad at you at first, but she'll get the help she needs.  Don't tell your parents, try someone at school, church, someone you trust.|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	Maybe she got raped at the party. She is showing the signs of it. If she stopped talking to her best friend and her boyfriend maybe they did something to her that made her this way.|`|I64JOuMKaa	hmm<br>  I think you touching her on the arm and she flinched<br>  kind of explained it<br>  <br>  im sorry but maybe she was raped at the party? its a possibility.<br>  Tell her that she can trust you with anything and that if anythings wrong she can always go to you.<br>  <br>  but she could also be sad that maybe her boyfriend broke up with HER?<br>  I mean , when I broke up with my boyfriend I was REALLY SAD , and really quiet didn't wanna talk to anyone at all not even my best friends, I just wanted to be alone and I was really sad, and I didnt want people touching me either I just wanted people to leave me alone.<br>  <br>  I eventually was okay after eating a bunch of icecream, reading some magazines, going to the mall to shop, alone.<br>  <br>  Maybe buy her some icecream magazines, anything she likes and give it to her and tell her that if anythings wrong she can tell you and you will help her and you wont judge her .<br>  <br>  good luck : )|`|kVZoeh9paa	It sounds like she got sexually harrassed/assulted or even raped... Although her boyfriend might just have broken up with her (not the other way around) and shes sad about it. But it diffenatly sounds like something is wrong. I wouldn't get your parents involved unless she actually tells you that she got sexually assulted/harrased or raped.Although you could have just scared her when she was playing video games, to the point she was just so engrossed in it that it scared her to the point she screamed. But just flinching when you touch her arm is weird...|`|l9IGytB0aa	As previous people have said, there's a possiblity that she was raped or molested.<br>  <br>  Or maybe she's just a little sad about her relationship coming to an end, are you sure it was her who ended the relationship?<br>  and even if she did, do you know why?<br>  <br>  try talking to her, because if your close, like you said. and she trusts you... then maybe she'll open up and you can really find out what happened.|`|oKwXjVolaa	If she seems nervous around you and other males, it could very well be that she was sexually molested, harassed, or even raped at that party. I don't want to scare you, but it's definitely possible if this is how she's acting. The best thing you can do is get her to open up about it. If you can find out what caused all this deep-rooted trauma, that's a good first step in getting her help. Don't get your parents involved unless you're absolutely sure she won't tell you, because that may scare her more. If she was raped, then definitely get them involved, but if it was something else, she may just want someone to talk to, and you can be that someone.
3Yfp3QUfaa	Oh, my gosh! I totally agree, they yell like we committed a crime! Ugh, I hate how moms can be that way! When I was in 7th grade I went to the bathroom and I was walking in the hallway because I was going back to the class to finish a test and I said "Hey Lily!" to my friend and my teacher heard me and she was like you cant talk to people during tests, and I wasnt even talking about the test and she knew. Then she called my mom and I got like in big trouble, wtf? I dont get life...<br>  <br>  hope i helped :)<br>  <br>  ~igotahotbf   lol|`|bfP8tjPKaa	YOU ARE SELFISH.

And it's not your mom's fault that you're in trouble it's yours because you're the one that decided not to sing, it's nobody's fault but yours that you got into trouble.|`|gwxcg0Ajaa	Just try to think what you would do when your older and your kid does the same thing.

XQuprZxUaa	I am not a 16-18 year old but I can tell you that babies are expensive. You have to have diapers that are about $10 a pack and they have about 30-50 in them. You will go through about 5-7 a day some days are more. Just depending on how much they go to the bathroom. You also have if you are bottle feeding formula that costs anywhere from $7 a can to $28 a can. You can get WIC and they will help with formula for the baby and then they will give you cheese,milk,cereal, and juice I think for five months after having the child. You also have to have clothes that can be any amount of price because no matter how much you think you have they always need more because they grow so quickly. You also need diaper wipes that are about $3 a pack. You need sock, hats, blankets, bottles, bottle brush, medicine when they get sick. Children are very expensive. I am not going to judge about your age I will just tell you that I was 25 when I had my first and I made about $3,000 a month and there were times after paying my bills and buying what I needed for my son that I didn't have enough money. Good luck you are never fully prepared for what having a child does to and for you. You have to learn that you are no longer what matters it is the child first and then yourself. You also have the late nights, and the trying to find time to shower and do your chores as well. It also makes you realize that what did I do with my spare time before I had a child. The are so much fun to watch them go through discovering the world around them.

HUZJvDSSaa	Different women experience pregnancy in different ways. Pregnancy symptoms may vary in intensity and duration - and some women may not experience some common pregnancy symptoms at all. <br>  <br>  Following implantation of the egg, however, the body undergoes many changes, and the levels of several hormones increase drastically. Pregnancy symptoms typically do not appear until 1-2 weeks after you miss your period - and fetal movement is not typically detected until 16 weeks post-conception. Earliest symptoms include:<br>  <br>  Implantation bleeding 8-10 days after ovulation. <br>  An elevated BBT temperatures for 18 days. <br>  A missed menstrual period. <br>  Even before your missed period, you can test for pregnancy with early detection pregnancy tests that allow you to determine a positive result as early as 7-10 days past ovulation. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  of course you are best to take a test to be certain:) good luck check out the site in my source aswell that should help!! xxx<br>  The First Trimester: Week 1 - Week 12<br>  <br>  Lower abdominal cramps. <br>  Food cravings. <br>  Nausea or "Morning sickness" - 3-10 weeks after conception. <br>  Tender, swollen breasts - 3-4 weeks after conception. <br>  Your nipples and the area around the nipples get darker and wider. <br>  Frequent urination. <br>  Fatigue and tiredness - 3-10 weeks after conception. <br>  You may have heartburn and constipation - along with headaches. <br>  Mood swings.|`|fjSfBBDsaa	Every women is different, and each pregnancy is different.

zGWg9RAiaa	I've had two vaginal deliveries and it sounds like you could go any day.  You're having "loose" stool because your hormones are changing a bit and your body is getting ready to move the baby out.  Try not to freak and make sure you're drinking plenty of fluids to replenish what you're losing.  If this is your first, when they tell you to push, seriously, push like you're having a bowel movement.  The baby will pop right out. :D  <br>  <br>  Check here.  <a href="http://www.ask.com/bar?q=signs+of+labor+in+pregnancy&page=1&qsrc=2105&zoom=Early+Signs+of+Pregnancy%7CPregnancy+Week+by+Week%7CEarliest+Possible+Signs+of+Pregnancy&ab=0&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.americanpregnancy.org%2Flabornbirth%2Fsignsoflabor.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ask.com/bar?q=signs+of+labor+...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  And here.<br>  <a href="http://www.ask.com/bar?q=Early+Signs+of+Labor&page=1&qsrc=6&zoom=Early+Signs+of+Pregnancy%7CPregnancy+Week+by+Week%7CEarliest+Possible+Signs+of+Pregnancy&ab=0&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pregnancyetc.com%2Fsigns_of_labor.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ask.com/bar?q=Early+Signs+of+...</a>|`|vsuXCMqzaa	You are in labor now. Call your doctor and let them know what's happening and they'll give you advice on whether to come in or stay at home for a bit.|`|D0oqTblpaa	Time your contractions.  If you are uncomfortable to the point where you can't walk through the pain go to the hospital.|`|HoonZJMgaa	Sounds like the beginning of labor! Get ready! Time your contractions and walk as much as you can it moves things along. Just don't go too far from home. Maybe just walk around the house. And CONGRATS! YOU ARE GONNA BE A MOMMY AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!
P0Fjh59Eaa	One thing to remember is that babies feel the heat and cold more than adults do. i try to remember that if it's cold outside i subtract 10 degrees because they feel the cold more intensely and can succumb to the elements faster than an adult. Same thing for the summer, they can over heat much faster.<br>  <br>  In August (depending on where you live) that can be quite hot. i think light weight onesies or light weight footed jumpers would do best. be sure to keep your baby out of direct sunlight, as they cannot wear sunscreen till 6 months of age and would be very fragile in the sunlight. <br>  if your baby lets you put a light weight summer hat on them that would be good too. (some babies hate hats, lol).<br>  <br>  anything light weight and lose fitting is best in summer months.|`|yB5go5wbaa	Onesies!  My 3 week old right now (granted he's inside most of the time and our heat is set on 72 degrees) mostly wears onesies and is usually wrapped in a blanket, so just a onesie in the summertime would be fine...he'd probably be okay wearing just a diaper if it's really hot, too.|`|be3e5b583c027426a0f22b62804479f0aa	where do you live? i live in NJ and it's hot here in august so i would dress the baby in summer clothes. it doesn't start getting cool until october or maybe some september nights.|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	well, let's do some calculations (i am an accountant, you see).. so august is the due month and clothing lasts usually for the first 3 months, so it's august, september and october that we have to worry about.. these months are the coldest (and rainiest) in NY (i used to live on long island).. so you have to get only long-sleeved onesies (at least 10), onesies with feet (like pjs) (another 7 - one for each day of the week), then warm blankets (at least 5 because you will be using them for at least 2 years).. as for the outerwear, i suggest to get a cotton (not polyester) snowsuit.. yes, you heard me right.. the size should fit 9 month old (that's the period from august to march - the coldest month in north east).. at first, your baby will be "sinking" inside the pram or snowsuit (whichever one you choose) but you won't have to buy another one until next october :).. i would recommend to check out the freecycle network to get it gently used or ebay (the latter has more of selection).. you should start now to get the best deal on clothing :)..|`|1WBimx1laa	I always just put them in onsies and some pants or they have little sweatsuits that are cute.|`|iNneJk47aa	<a href="http://favoritechildrendesigners.rare-boutique.com" rel="nofollow">http://favoritechildrendesigners.rare-bo...</a>|`|puFIUwWHaa	I can tell you for naps and sleeping at night, the Magic Sleepsuit is perfect.

aaZ0cTdCaa	It is a symptom, but it is definitly not something you should bank on as far as whether you are pregnant or not.. <br>  <br>  Almost any symptom of pregnancy could also be a symptom or cause by something else... the best thing to do is wait and take a test when your period is due...|`|FLOjzbKEaa	not really but may be|`|VXcp8hvHaa	the first symptom is white stuff running down your leg|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	sometimes but usually not early pregnancy|`|OTXFuGFMaa	No, you just like to beef it up allot.
ahjqc9Ifaa	I certainly wouldn't be concerned, although I'd stop drinking now.<br>  <br>  Remember, the parents of the Baby Boomers did not know alcohol was damaging and drank freely their entire pregnancies. Yet the boomers were the healthiest generation of babies ever born up to that time.<br>  <br>  My understanding is that extended alcohol abuse during your pregnancy is what's risky, not three drinks done twice a week apart. Forgive yourself and stay healthy from this point forward, okay?|`|Oq2B7I4faa	You are fine.  you are still very early stage of pregancy.  Most women find out they are pregnant at about 6 to 8 week of pregnancy and during those time we eat and drink everything normally.  So I think you are just fine.  If the test came out positive than you should make an appointment with your gyno to conferm.|`|kVIOtS5gaa	I know you are concerned but do not fret! Many women are unaware of their pregnancy so early on & drink alcohol. You will be fine as long as you do not drink from here on out! If you do not believe me ask your doctor.|`|DTYHoinVaa	Totally fine, the umbilical cord has not even connected this early. Just dont do it from this point. I did the same thing. My doctor said there was no need to worry.|`|NzQH7dQ1aa	I had my christmas party the week before i found out i was pregnant, i only had about 1.5 coolers. I asked the nurse about and she said not to worry about it all!!! It should be fine, ask the doctor at your next appointment, just so you hear it from a professional, its comforting :) Best of luck with the pregnancy!|`|TJ4q7X8Vaa	No worries. A lot of women do the same thing. I had 4 drinks at a birthday dinner 2 weeks after conception and 4-5 at a concert a week later. It happens. It's not like you are an alcoholic drinking everyday. My baby was born perfectly healthy at 8lbs 7oz after a very normal pregnancy.|`|MRV9rNyjaa	i found out that i was pregnant back in august...i wanna say around the middle of august. well my birthday is on the 6th, and we went out to the bar, and i got hammered. once i found out i was expecting, i stopped drinking, i felt guilty as all hell that i was drinking. now being only 8 wks out. everything is fine and normal. my baby is healthy and i couldnt ask for anything more than that.|`|AA11830777	I found out that I was pregnant right after new years a couple yrs ago. I drank a lot. Couple weeks later found out I was pregnant, didn't drink anymore. You should be fine. It's not like you are a daily drinker. Congrats.<br>  <br>  BTW, Mr. Awesome needs to get a life.|`|AA11018222	Should be fine.  If it was a whole bottle of vodka you might have reason to be concerned.  Otherwise, just don't drink more.  What the doctors are usually concerned about are the everyday drinkers or the binge drinkers.|`|HjKipXPzaa	a lot of ppl have this concern, in the first early months, i believe its the first 2-3 it cant really hurt the fetus....just dont drink now!|`|rOfFOcwpaa	um, stop drinking and start seeing a doctor.|`|TCzvigiuaa	stop drinking NOW.|`|1s3nddaYaa	no, you should be good. nothing will be wrong, just dont drink anymore|`|V8wUAVdyaa	he or she will be fine.  It was too early to cause any harm.  Stop drinking any alcohol from here on out though.
E2e485WRaa	I had asked my OBGYN about the tight pants also.  She said that I couldn't hurt the baby.  I was just going to make myself uncomfortable.  Its just going to get worse.  You will need to get maternity pants. <br>  <br>  You really shouldn't do whatever you want.  What a stupid remark by your doctor.  Your doctor is suppose to help guide you.

I needed to get maternity pants at 8 weeks. Everyone is different.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Its not too early for clothes to start fitting tighter. Thats very normal in early pregnancy. If your clothes are tight, it won't hurt the baby, it will just be very uncomfortable for you. I recommend starting to wear maternity clothes, or more just clothes that are more stretchy. I know its hard not to worry when your pregnant. I used to worry alot especially in earlier pregnancy. but just relax and enjoy it. good luck.|`|de2a2663fe4b3d02deeeda407aee1db1aa	follow the signs of your body. If your pants feel uncomfortable and to tight then more than likely you need to wear looser clothing. Its simple If tight pants hurt you then the baby probably feels some pressure to. Although the little protected , when your body is telling you something, listen to it.|`|hORVMOHKaa	no you cant hurt the baby he/she is so small they cant even feel it! and your pants are probably getting tighter due to bloating, its to early for you to start showing

You obviously no that there are families out there that are ready to raise a baby but cannot.  So how about you just give that little one to someone special.<br>  If you think that you will regret it though than deep down you probably want this baby.  Don't do something you might regret, it will tear you to peices your whole life.|`|mTyu7CKoaa	ur dads angry once baby is born he will come around, so keep ur baby.... and ur 18 u knew what would happen if u had sex, its time to be a big girl and take responsibility|`|AA11064536	Welcome to the world of adults.

So he can pay the rent your dad wants, you will also get benefits so that will go towards the babys care. Looking after a baby isn't easy, but it's not impossible.

He is also mad because you didn't tell him that you are pregnant and had to find out from someone else. The decision to keep the baby is yours and it is something that you will have to live with for the rest of your life. And if you decide to keep the baby all his resentment will go out of the window once he sees that little face and holds his grandchild for the first time. I  would advise for you to sit down and talk to your boyfriend about everything that is going on and make a decision...Good luck|`|6xwdFvdpaa	awww i feel for you hun, you've got to realise your daddys girl and he is just worried and angry at the moment, give him a couple of days im sure he will calm down a little, first of all what does your boyfriend think about you being pregnant and would his family be able to help you out? second of all your 18 and if you really want to have this baby it will be hard but it is hard for any mother to be no matter what age you are. i suggest you sit down with your dad and boyfriend and his parents if possible and talk about your feelings and hopefully you will all come to a decision together but if that does not work then at the end of the day it is your decision whether to have this baby or not i wish you luck hun and hope you decide what to do for the right reasons and not because you have been pushed into a decision x|`|T9SgqPyhaa	You always have the option of open adoption, which gives the baby the opportunity to be with a family who can fully support it (financially, emotionally, etc.) and still lets you know how the baby is doing throughout its life.  Sometimes you even have the opportunity to have visits.  I'm not sure if this is something you would even consider, but it is an option.<br>  <br>  What I can tell you is I am 22 with 2 kids, 1 on the way and am married.  It's not easy.  Babies are expensive and time consuming.  I love my kids, but I'm not afraid to say that it is the hardest 24/7/365 job I will ever have.<br>  <br>  You need a chance to go to college and get a degree so that when you do decide to start a family you will have the money to do so.

Your father is willing to let you and your boyfriend live there but u would have to pay*~ I agree with that and at least hes allowing your boyfriend to stay with you*~ I think if you except this responsibility and he sees that you guys are working hard and trying to do right he may be less strict with it all*~ Im sure your father will help you out *~ if hes willing to let you guys live there*!

If you are not ready to be a mom, then don't do it. Its something that you will deal with for the rest of your life. Don't let your father bully you into breaking up with your man, though. You ARE 18, and you can do what you want (but not in his house). If he pushes it and you really want to stay with your boyfriend, move out.|`|ZuENZiB0aa	come on.if you feel that you are ready to take care of the baby then go ahead and have it. abortions are as good as killing someone. don't have an abortion. tell your dad that you are ready. he will believe you. he is your dad! talk to your boyfriend and sort out everything. he should be responsible for the baby also. your dad is just being a dad. every father wants his daughter to be happy and live a nice life. he is saying all that to you only because he cares!<br>  <br>  best of luck!|`|M89CyJLHaa	I know how the both of you feel. I got pregnant at 18, too. And now that I have a kid, I can't even begin to imagine how I'd feel if he put me in that situation as a parent.<br>  I can answer this based on how upset my parents were when I informed them. My dad was the same as yours. He was angry and wouldn't speak to me for nearly a week. He wouldn't even look at me. It's the only time in my life I've ever seen him cry. My mom was in tears for nearly weeks.<br>  Your dad will come around eventually. He has to run this through his head for a while and accept it as it is.<br>  As for your options, I would suggest keeping your baby. Of course I'm biased on this. I myself, was literally inches away from an abortion that thankfully failed. Now that I have my baby son, I could not even imagine life without him. That's a precious life you're dealing with there, not some blob.<br>  Parenthood may be a great thing for you and your boyfriend's relationship! As corny as it sounds, it actually does bring you much closer. <br>  ..And taking care of a kid is totally worth it. It's not as scary as it sounds at all. Being a young mother is awesome. ..Imagine being the neighborhood 'hot mom' when your kid is older. ;D|`|RBuPp9Evaa	i know where ur coming from, i was in the same boat, but it wasn't my dad it was my mom. she wasn't trying to make us break up but she also wasn't having me staying with her with a child. I did not keep my child and yes, i truly regretted it in the long run. that was a year ago and now i am expecting again, yes i got the same results from my mom. Now, (Im 3 months) she accepting it. I thought under pressure, so my advice is sit with your man and talk about what the 2 of you really think would be the best for  the 2 of u and what u 2 want. Its your baby and your life, don't let him decide for u by scaring u.|`|RYMUXVSTaa	Your father is being unreasonable to demand that you not see the baby daddy right now.  No matter what happens you should be in contact with the father of the child.  However, your father is being very reasonable to kick you out or demand rent if you move in with your baby and baby daddy.  Imagine how your father feels right now.  You turned 18, obviously moving out age.  They you drop the ball and say you are knocked up and want to keep living at home with a baby and a stranger  to boot.  Keep the baby.  You will regret not having it for the rest of your life.  Get on birth control until you are ready againl.  Birth control is way cheaper than raising a baby.|`|jzHrI6Ydaa	Both options are going to have life-changing consequences. You're 18. Your dad can't legally keep you from your boyfriend, but you DO live with him, so disobeying could get you kicked out. Just talk about with the people around you. Talk to your boyfriend about what option he wants to take. When you're dad calms down a little, talk to him about it. He's pissed now, but you are HIS child, and I would hope he could be there for you in a time like this. Look into your options, and don't forget about adoption! There are so many couples out there who can't conceive and would see this as a blessing.|`|lbJS1SRtaa	You are old enough now to take care of a child..but if you and your bf are not ready then dont go through with it. I would say make sure that your bf wants to make things happen with you and wants to stay commited with the idea.  If you both are in it together then go for it..dont let your dad choose who you can or cannot be with.  Ive been through that before and I was kicked out of my moms house too.  You and your dad will work through it eventually.  It will take time, but if you have your bf's support or other family to support you through this then everything will be worth it in the end.  Good Luck!
WMPqVYe1aa	Hi, this is probably your dads way of punishing you for getting suspended.  For some reason some dads seem to think that after dishing out the punishment they also have to not talk to you to keep you feeling bad about what you have done.I don't think that by not talking to you means he hates you he's probably a bit shocked by what has happened.  Let him cool down and wait to someone else comes home that you can talk to, may-be your older brother.|`|VGRah7Xuaa	He doesn't hate you! he's just upset that you did it!! try writing a note telling him how you feel. tell him how you think he hates you.. it will probably lighten up his mood. also leave the note where he can find it easily|`|TlSUgrU3aa	he doesn't hate you but i think you should not try to talk to him but change a little. i mean dont talk to him dont let him see that you want to talk ok lets see what happends after that|`|tm2gnYblaa	1-800-843-5200<br>  youth crisis line <br>  <br>  A good number to call so  that you can talk to someone about how you are feeling and even get resources about how talk to your dad|`|KEXZtZeRaa	sounds like he's just disappointed in you.<br>  Give him time, maybe he'll forgive you eventually.<br>  BUT, it's not ok for him to spank you, and you need to vocalize that if you don't like it|`|6riTvxHuaa	He probably doesn't know what to do.

He probably feels that your lack of interaction and talking with him is punishment in and of itself.  I'm sure he doesn't hate you, for if he did, he would go on like normal as if you never did anything.  In a weird paradox, his ignoring you is his way of showing his love for you.  He wants you to grow up to be a mature, caring member of society and this is his way of dealing out a consequence to you.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	He is rightly very upset with you and doesn't want to even look at you right now. Let him cool off and prepare to face more punishments for being such a rotten child.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Your dad doesn't hate you...he is mad at you.<br>  <br>  Stay in your room and let him calm down.He'll get over it soon.<br>  <br>  If you wanted, you could write him a letter explaining that you are sorry and you never meant to disappoint him.|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	He probably feels like he didn't raise you to be disrespectful and just doesn't know how to talk to you.

rOfFOcwpaa	of-course you're not being selfish by keeping the baby, you'd be selfish if you have your child aborted. Personally I think you are doing the right thing, and personally your boyfriend doesn't sound so wonderful to me. No life is not worth living, If you have concerns or worries with providing for the baby after it is born, I'd suggest giving him or her up for adoption rather than having him or her aborted. anyways, good luck.|`|uCnmYEPBaa	Only you can answer your question.<br>  Raising a child is a tough thing.

You are doing the right thing by keeping the baby.  It would be selfish to have an abortion.  I would take it as a blessing that you are pregnant since you weren't supposed to be able to.

Once you have that baby I promise you you won't regret it.  Neither one of ours was planned, but I wouldn't change having them for a second.  They are angels.  Good luck to you!|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	I think it would be selfish for you to the end the life of your unborn baby bc your boyfriend doesn't want the responsibility.

You should look at your life & decide how YOU want to handle it.  You also might want to look at the different options availabl.e<br>  <br>  Your doctor told you that you couldn't become pregnant...and now you are.  Is there a chance the doctor was wrong?  Or was it just that the CHANCES of pregnancy was low?  If he was wrong, you have the chance to have another baby when you are older.  If he was right...or the chances were just slim, you may not have this oppurtunity again.<br>  <br>  I was 20 when I had my first child.  My husband and I weren't married at the time, but were planning to be.<br>  <br>  Is OPCD an ovarian cyst type of disorder?  I wasn't really sure what that was.  If you abort your baby, that could cause further issues in your uterus (scar tissue) that can prevent pregnancy.  If you put your baby up for adoption, your uterus is spared some issues and another family is benefitting.  If you keep your baby...you may lose your boyfriend, but end up with a partner that you will be attached to for life.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|FfGHHhqBaa	i think you should do what is in your best interest, i don't believe in abortion and with the problem you said you have this could be your only chance and an abortion could minimize the chance of ever being able to have a baby again, consider yourself blessed... Do what you think is right for yourself. my mother raised my brother and i on her own and we are ok.|`|DTYHoinVaa	You sure are doing the right thing. Think about it as a miracle, you werent supposed to be able to have babies remember? If you do it on your own, thats ok. You may someday meet a great man who will take you and the baby as his own. Your boyfriend may also change further down the road. You are doing the right thing. Good luck.|`|zGdyJbYUaa	If he was wonderful as you say he would let you do whatever makes you happy not him. So you have the baby and its beautiful wonderful thing just forget him. Its more your baby then his all he did was put the sperm in you. He don't want it screw him?|`|5LzZYrQnaa	no keep it... its up to you not him and if he doesnt want to be there then tell him to leave. you dont need him. im sure your family will be there for the good, bad, happy and sad times but it will be okay|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Yes you are doing the right thing! If you want that baby then don't let him bully you out of it. Do what you feel is right in your heart!|`|AXEqOEloaa	If you want it you keep it, never ever pick anyone over your child. Good luck to you and your bundle of joy.|`|riYtpDRmaa	Have it.<br>  It might not be posible to have another kid again.<br>  You'll regret it if you dont.|`|Ej2EOsvKaa	First of all! Wow congrats on gettine pregnant! A pregnancy is a blessing ...never a curse and if everyone saw it this way there would be less abortions (i am not saying I am against) ANyways let me just say this....you are asking if YOU are being selfish for keeping the baby....have you thought yet...(and I mean to disrespect in this) but have you ever though that maybe your BF is being selfish for not owning up to his responsibilty as a soon to be father! <br>  <br>  Everyone is scared at first but just let him know that you cant get rid of something so precious that you may not have another chance to get! You are making such a wise decision by keeping your angel inside you. Regardless of what happens you will have your baby in the end and you can do it. I was scared too, I found I was pregnant at 19. I still live at home and did not want to tell my folks. YOu know, you wonder, is it the right guy, right time....but its the right baby no matter what your other answers were. <br>  <br>  Hopefuly your bf is just scared at this moment and he will realize what a blessing this is! I wish you all the luck in the world and congradulations mommy to be :)|`|AA11018222	I usually would advise adoption to people who are looking at having to raise a baby without both parents and are not financially stable.  It is sort of like the octo-mom.  Should she have kept all of the kids when she was single and couldn't afford them?<br>  <br>  But from the heart. If it were me, I would keep it.  I know that I would be angry forever at myself if I gave up the one chance I had to have a baby.  Sometimes God gives you what you really need.<br>  <br>  Sorry he's putting you in such a position that you have to choose.|`|u6BNPURKaa	If you want kids and you were told that you could not concieve.. And now you have concieved.. Then keep the baby. You may NOT have a second chance.  5 months is nowhere near enough time to know if he is "The One". he may not be there to hold your hand during your final days, but your child WILL... If you keep it.<br>  <br>  Find someone else who support YOU and what you want for your life. Dump the guy. Keep the kid.|`|NMDGxkr1aa	You should do what is best for you and the child. If you feel that it is in your best interest to keep it and be without the father then that's ok. If you feel that the situation is too complicated to put a baby through then weigh your options.  Do what you feel will not cause huge regret later in life.|`|9zM6QFEOaa	yes , and you sound like you are gonna be a great mom. your b/f didn't plan to have a baby yet so if he sounds unhappy, this is understandable, he might suprise you later, and become very happy about it.but even if you have to do it by yourself, you are still gonna be a great mom.|`|ZvkX9uNraa	It is not selfish at all for you to want your baby, and in fact it is selfish of him to expect you to not keep the baby that is a part of you as much as it is him. Do not let anyone pressure you into what you feel in your heart is right!|`|7jXChfBNaa	i think keeping the baby is the right choice. you are not being selfish at all. and you know what either way if you terminate the pregnancy or keep the baby it is ultimately your choice hun and if he doesn't want to be apart of the baby's life then screw him.|`|W0nImzeqaa	This baby could be your one and only. If I were you I'd keep it regardless of what he says. If he Truly loves you he will let you keep it and be a father. If I were in you shoes. I'd keep the baby. I think you really and truely should keep the baby n if he aint going to be a father thne leave him. 5 months proves he loves you but not your choice.|`|uYDoPNv9aa	keep the baby.<br>  babies are a blessing from a god.<br>  rember some people cant even have a baby so for sure keep the baby|`|w0y9FmZWaa	I honestly think you should keep it. You wont be the first single mother or the last. Im sure you will have alot of people that will help you with the baby. It might be hard at first but once you have it you will fall in love. and besides you need a guy that going to stand by your side regardless. One more thing.... what if you decide to get an abortion and then in the future you want to have a baby but cant..... your gonna regret it for the rest of your life... If he is worth you giving up your baby then by all means go for it but if not...... I regret it every day of my life
PWS0x8Gwaa	It depends on where you live, and how old you are. In many states in the US you can't get an abortion without parental consent, but that may not apply where you live so check online.<br>  Typically, insurance will not cover an abortion.<br>  To talk about payments, the procedure, or really anything else, with confidentiality on your side, go to your nearest Planned Parenthood. You can find locations on their Web site.<br>  <br>  And as they've said before, you're going to get a lot of negative responses on here, but it's your decision, not theirs, so do what you think is right for your needs, not what the Internet tells you to do.<br>  Good luck. :)|`|a67f223481e1f00da8ea5d7d5f8d576caa	If you did have something covered by insurance, and this would not be it, then it would show up on a bill.<br>  <br>  If you were raped then you CERTAINLY need to tell your parents.  There are things you will need help with psychologically (I have been sexually abused so sweetie, trust me, I know what I am saying) and an abortion can contribute to even more mental and emotional distress.  Please be aware of what abortion is and does so that you do not learn the hard way.  I know of many people who have gone for a "procedure" to remove "tissues of conception" and once they see their tiny baby are devastated.  Your parents need to know so they can help you.  The person that raped you needs to be held accountable.  There is not much I regret more than my parents not prosecuting to protect me while leaving the ^%&* to roam free and hurt other young girls.  Be careful... abortions increase cancer risks and one reason I strongly support parents rights to know is because you are a minor, a young women who has been violated and that needs to be gently handled.  In addition there are complications that have arisen for some resulting in death.  However if their parents knew what happened they would have been able to prevent it from happening.  Not only did they lose their precious daughter but their grandbaby as well.  Let your parents love you through this.  Hugs.|`|ppG2smDWaa	You NEED a parent to be present and it typically isn't paid for by insurance so you will need cash or check. They usually start out at around $400 for very early pregnancy and go up from there. Anytime you use insurance it shows up on a bill. Your parents get an explaination of benefits anytime the insurance is used with details on what procedures were done. You would have to go to an abortion clinic. Family doctors don't do them.|`|tz6ksGFkaa	I do medical billing and I can tell you that insurance will NOT cover it and even if they did, your parents would get the explanation of benefits from your insurance company.<br>  I totally agree with m*a*n and hope you will tell your parents and consider adoption.<br>  This is nothing you can't get through, but I think having an abortion may haunt you for the rest of your life.<br>  I truly wish you luck.|`|de2a2663fe4b3d02deeeda407aee1db1aa	You can have one done without your parents knowledge. Weather your insurance covers it or not I dont know. Best bet is to call your local clinic and ask what there policy is.You can also call your doctor and see if they do referrals for this service which would be covered under your med insurance.Pediatricians do not perform abortions sorry. Call Planned Parenthood, or a local sex clinic in your area. They'll get you started. If your only getting an abortion because your afraid to tell your parents I would suggest against it. Maybe you should tell them and work it out together. I had my first at 14 and believe me I thought my mom was going to knock me into a diffrent country. It wasnt so bad. He's here now and had I not gotten up the courage to tell her Ihis chances would not have been so good.|`|XdSWfpe7aa	ok......if ur raped then tell ur parents about it!!!abortion is not the answer...have u seen the movie juno? u can do that too continue ur pregnancy and have ur baby for adoption.....or maybe ur  not really raped and just making this up...why wont u tell ur family then decide what u want with ur pregnancy.....|`|XYBHM8aSaa	No, insurance does not pay for any of it.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	sorry but i think you need to tell your parents.|`|WPI0Z47saa	Sorry but you need a parent to be present if you are under 18. Abortion is not covered by insurance unless it is a life or death situation. You need to go to a clinic to have it done. Your family doctor has nothing to do with it. They might be able to refer you to someone in your area but that is all they will do. The cheapest is usually around $500-600 and you need cash or check and it must be paid prior to the procedure being performed.|`|98WKYtfwaa	I agree with the user who said this is a touchy subject.<br>  <br>  Alot of places don't need parental consent if you're over 16, but they get a psychiatrist to speak to you first then they show you videos of an abortion being performed then ask if you stil want to go through with it - i read this on another question, the girl was referring to planned parenthood. <br>  <br>  I don't know about insurance as i'm from the UK and we don't have insurance. I'm sure that abortions aren't covered by insurance though, well i'm actually more than 100% on that one. If it was too be covered by insurance, it would show up.<br>  <br>  Abortions are costly, i mean over $600. <br>  <br>  Go to your doctor and ask about your next step, like i said, America is different from the UK.<br>  <br>  Please reconsider terminating your baby.|`|000cec0ed22ec167c9a8cf98303156dcaa	I think that you should grow up and tell your parents the truth. Word will get out eventually. They can help you go through an abortion. However, it's not always the right choice. You had sex and got pregnant so grow up and take care of your baby. Don't abort it. There's always adoption. I would look up the closest abortion clinic such as going to yellowpages.com and type in abortions and the area code and call them. They will take it from there. But tell your parents and make sure this is the right decision. I hope it's not, you don't want to live the rest of your life thinking you didn't give an innocent baby the chance at life even if you did give it up for adoption do you? Think about things first. Good luck!|`|6qsfdMg1aa	I have so many negative things to say to these people who are being rude to you, i just can't right them all down. <br>  But I want to tell you something. You are not alone, many people are going through this right now. <br>  And what you need right now is a person who is going to be there with you through all of this. Someone you truly trust. <br>  I don't believe in a God so I am not going to pray for u to make some kind of decision.<br>  I believe in you to do whatever you think is right and obviously you already know so kudos to you for knowing what you want!<br>  These people suck!<br>  <br>  Sorry I'm not answering your questions many of these people already did. I'm just disgusted with people writing their responses so rudely!|`|ncUhlwevaa	Your going to get a lot of negative answers as abortion is a touchy subject in the category you chose to post this question. Contact your local planned parenthood. They will be able to give you all of the information needed. Good Luck!
A2XYCdOYaa	Oh my good lord.  You have to get this girl help!  If what you say is true then she is in no fit state to be a parent, and she is doing irreversible harm to this unborn child...makes me sick when so many people can't have children.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	You should go read a book and stop trolling around on the internet|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Drink the gin with her|`|XtYRcczIaa	So you write like you have an english accent..<br>  But you use dollars and you have a horrid spelling problem, and a grammar problem...<br>  Get a life...|`|RxeQJcqhaa	Troll|`|bQ6LNgGbaa	That's horrible!<br>  Drinking and smoking that much won't necessarily abort the baby but he or she could be born with multiple disabilities! I would sit down with her and tell her how much doing this could not only hurt the baby but also hurt her. If you are giving her that much money a week then I would stop giving her the money and use it to help her get an abortion. I assume your step daughter would be okay with an abortion but I don't know if you are so of course, if you are not okay with abortion, do not take her to get an abortion.<br>  Good luck|`|kg18TbsGaa	what the hell? you cheated on your wife with her brother? thats gross. she needs a serious reality check.. your wife should've have paid more attention to her how the heck could she be addicted to crack cocaine and why does she have a 28 yr old boyfriend? who cares if she black males you there is a babys life at stake and its not the babys fault .. you guys need help.. the entire family i would say.|`|PTLXDmG4aa	if i were you i would tell her mother.. you can't keep this from her..<br>  if i were her mother and i found out my 16 year old daughter was on drugs, drinking and was pregnant and the step-mother knew and didn't say anything i would be SO angry, and any relationship between us would be ruined.. <br>  the girl is 16, she NEEDS help! she obviously is too scared or not in a good place to be making these decisions you need to do the right thing.. <br>  don't put your secret infront of this baby and this 16 year old girls life..
rwFh9VaIaa	How about Seven?|`|AA11138222	Another option would be to use your husband's middle name as his middle name.<br>  <br>  Alonzo is a nice name and I think it sounds nice with your other son's name.|`|AA12188347	I love the idea and the way the initials work out......very cute...if named Alonzo would you call him something for short or by his full first name always??   I also like the combo of the names .....Callen Elias Alonzo Martinez but the initials arent as cool...........I guess you could use it the first way and call him ACE for a nick name if ya wanna........|`|p0Jbbkopaa	I would think about how he would feel in second grade introducing himself. Alonzo is a nice name, but it's difficult for a kid to have. <br>  <br>  Callen is a really great name though, and it's unique to your family.|`|VFTArdQxaa	Alonzo is just adorable! <br>  <br>  Also, <br>  <br>  Alonzo Callen Elias sounds so professional, but a great boys name. Very ruFF.|`|dW9C6aswaa	I Agree Don't name him Alonzo <br>  <br>  <br>  I really like Callen Elias Martinez|`|zwJaIDFeaa	JUST NAME HIM BOB FOR PETE SAKE!!! <br>  <br>  haha jk. :)|`|rrNuxB0zaa	DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT NAME HIM ALONZO!!!!!!!! THATS A TERRIBLE AND MEAN AND CRUEL NAME!!!!!!! DONT DO IT!!!!!!!<br>   no offense, but that really is an awful name. what about Callen Ames Elias Martinez? or just Callen Ames Martinez? do you have to have elias in there? it sounds a bit much like alijah.....
vjC5FVDaaa	You have to be eighteen to change your name, hun.|`|AJxl0IvHaa	Im not sure but you may have to take it to a judge since your a minor,<br>  But who cares right now?? Just wait until your 18.|`|AA12188347	I dont know about your name but you can give your baby the last name you want when she is born.....at least you can in the USA....then just change your name later....ohhhh...but I bet you want the same last name as hers on her birth certificate huh??....hmmmmmm...wish I were more help..|`|zwJaIDFeaa	don't change your name yet. there's honestly no reason too be. you should just be happy for what awesome name you have!|`|qqiVKUBpaa	I think that the name you chose is beautiful. I'm not sure how you would go about having it changed though. It makes it a little trickier that you aren't an American citizen yet. I would ask about it when you go to get your citizenship done. If your baby is due before then maybe give her Alexander as a second middle name, that way it will be easier to drop off Leon once you have have it changed.<br>  <br>  Sorry I can't be more helpful! Congrats on your baby girl!
Y9mew1mwaa	I was lucky my son started sleeping 11-14 hours straight at 10 weeks old. I was in the same boat as you before that. I talked to pediatrician and she reccomended we start trying to go to sleep on his own. We were rocking him for long periods of time and trying to get him in crib without waking him. Usually an hour later we were doing the same thing over. I started a bedtime routine that happended at the same time every night. Then would rock him until he was drowsy but still awake and put him in his crib. Of course he would cry, so i would stay in there  patting his bum or singing so he would calm down. the first few nights this took a very long time, but after 4 nights or so he go to sleep faster, until i could just put him in his crib and he would doze off on his own after 10 min or so. This is not to be confused with cry it out. I did not do this!! Babies just need to become accustomed to falling asleep in their own bed. That way when they naturally wake during the night they do  not always need you to put them back to sleep. Also at 2 months some babies are not able to sleep through the night without feedings. I would ask your doc if it is safe to try and cut back on night feedings.|`|M5E3mDBJaa	Honestly, the number one answer you will find here is that he will do it when he is physically capable and mentally able.  Before he can sleep through the night he has to learn how to self sooth himself back to sleep.  That could be by changing position, or finding his fist, etc.  The average starting age for a baby to sleep through the night is closer to 3 months, so give him another few weeks, and even then it's too early to worry too much.  My oldest only started at 11 weeks - so your little guy sounds pretty normal to me.|`|942758fd1ed500339f1a1e8db65b2d27aa	I'm not a huge help, I have a 3 week old & he sleeps pretty good. I co sleep with him though & breastfeed, so whenever he gets hungry I just pull him over to my bed(his crib is attsached to our bed, & feed him then when he's done we go back to sleep. Sometimes I will put him back over into his bed.|`|dRKGXQmeaa	Mine is exactly the same! He is only just starting to sleep a little more at night, which is amazing.<br>  What's helped for me is making sure he gets lots of activity throughout the day. Going for walks outside, visiting grandparents, playing, tummytime, listening to music all help. He needs to know that daytime is for visiting, playing, and being active and awake, and at nighttime we sleep. When we stay home all day he gets very bored and cranky and needs to be constantly walked to even take a few minutes worth of a nap. I don't play with him or talk to him when I wake up to change and feed him at night, I just go about it quietly and calmly to keep him mellow. Strangely, even at this age a tight swaddle still helps very ocasionally, and we can sometimes get away with rocking him in his carseat on the floor next to us for brief naps. Infant carriers (like a baby bjorn) helped us a lot too. He is guaranteed to sleep when walked outside in a stroller or carrier. <br>  As for night time, it's aaallll about routine (and getting one set up now is a great time) I've noticed that our little guy will be sleeping up to 3 hours earlier than usual if we bath him in the big tub with daddy holding him, lotion him, dress him, nurse and put him to bed. He falls asleep after nursing briefly and I just carry him to the bassinet. If we don't do the bath thing, he will be awake until 2 am fussing and being generally discontent. As for sleeping through the night I've got a trick - I only feed him on one boob all night so the other collects til morning, then I pump that one and can get a good 4 or 5 oz. from it. At the end of that day, I will feed him the 4 or 5 oz then nurse him (only briefly as he's very full and just likes to be on/near a boob lol) At that point he's 'tanked up' for the night and can sleep about 4 hours straight if I'm lucky. The best night we had, he slept a straight 6 hours.<br>  It sounds like your little guy is just confused and needs a good bedtime routine. Bath time really worked for us, and I didn't really believe in it at all. We also co-sleep for a bit of the night, so when he gets up anywhere between 4 and 6, I bring him into my bed and have him in my lap on a nursing pillow with my arms around him, sitting up sleeping. I trust myself a lot more this way than on my side, because there's no way he can fall out of my little arm fortress or off the pillow, and I can't roll on him or anything. Plus I don't have to worry about daddy rolling on him, which scares me more.<br>  Good luck!! I know how exhausting and frustrating this can be! Hopefully he will figure things out soon :)
X8nVWtqZaa	I know it's hard; but Kaylie is right. You need to break the habit of coming back.<br>  I know the screaming and crying will want you to come running to her rescue and quiet her down; but it IS NECESSARY!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2F5HNPqPaa	I don't usually think cry-it-out is the answer... but my son's childminder was saying today how her daughter did this (though at night too) and eventually at 13 months she just didn't go in.  The little girl stopped after 10-15 mins, went to sleep and never made a fuss again.  She says she wishes she'd done it earlier and saved months of trouble.  Maybe you could try and leave her to it just once and see how it goes?|`|B4GLQY3gaa	as hard as it is as a mother you need to not go back inthere because she's getting used to you doing that and that you will go in there ... break the habit now trust me! feed her, lay her down sing to her and pat her back or rub her tummy then go out after a minute or so and don't to in she will eventually fall asleep and get used to the habit|`|DHzQBxOfaa	My wife found that she had to take the children to bed, feed them and lie with them to get them to sleep.  As they got older, she could read to them and get them to sleep.<br>  <br>  They were also kept in the same room as she when she was working around the house.  They often fell asleep on the lounge or dining room floor - nd she would leave them there.  Some kids just need company.|`|JxPw8OaHaa	LOL out of experience.  My son did this to me and I learned the hard way that giving in is not the best choice in the long run, I ended up spending every nap time patting his back and making sure every little thing was just right. It took a long time trying to get him to sleep and once he fell asleep I was ready for a nap too.  He was 5 before he would sleep alone. I was told to put the child in the crib, and allow them to cry.  It is not the easiest to hear your child scream their lungs out but the doctor told me that it will allow them to develop their own way of calming themselves to sleep.  Be patient and consistant.   Good Luck

I didn't do it when I was in high school, but I know people who did, and they got to work in doctors offices and do job shadowing in the medical field.|`|6zkKEeGCaa	Neonatal Nurse.|`|K5TrkUhCaa	Neonatal nurse.|`|chUxLFidaa	Neonatal nurse. Or maybe you're referring to a doula.|`|ADTtYII0aa	They are called pediatric nurses.
QnJvJ67uaa	I can remember feeding my youngest (7 weeks old and just back from an extended hospital stay), my middle one (10 months) screaming in the playpen and my eldest one (3) grabbing the ringing phone as I said "LEAVE IT!!"<br>  I brushed off the friend who called, hung up and burst into tear. I didn't know how I was going to cope...but I did.<br>  Don;t be someone else in front of your husband, he married you not his mother, make sur ehe knows exactly how you are feeling so he can help you emotionally and practically.<br>  See your Dr, even if its just for a talk, there are a lot of mums out there who are feeling overwhelmed, you are NOT alone, you WILL get better.<br>  Also if you don;t feel comfortable in mums groups how about joining a networking group online?? Sometimes its just nice to interact with another adult who knows what you are going through :)<br>  Good luck xx|`|avdgNTMfaa	you're going to be okay. my sis had a newborn when her first was only 15 months. i know its hard right now but things will get easier. she was basically going crazy and then one day she said she looked at them and remembered that it wouldn't be like that for long and one day she would look back wishing that her baby wanted to be held. i know thats not very helpful for the time being but i think your going through the same thing that all parents of young children do. maybe u should ask your fiance for one day a week that could be your girls night out this is what i do and it works wonders (i have a whiny two year old) lol anyway i hope all goes well. u will be okay|`|lGrcLQ49aa	Honey, you are not crazy - you are a mom of two very little ones.  It is OK to feel stress and it does not make you weak to have a bad day, be sad or feel stress.  You can make it through this - try to get some rest, being exhausted makes stress so much worse.  <br>  <br>  Prayers to you.|`|dcd11iUwaa	sweetie its 100% natural to feel that way,<br>  and when you have kids its not healthy to be depressed so please go and get some help asap ok,|`|uGqYoZNEaa	Stay strong, if you can go see a dr pronto!  There is nothing wrong with getting on an anti-depressant.  I was on one for about a year after my first kid was born.<br>  <br>  All that should matter is that you become strong and keep your spirits up with your 2 children.  Your husband doesn't even have to know that you're taking them if you want him to think you're strong on your own.  Don't have ppl watch your kids if you can help it given what you said about that situation.<br>  Where do you live at?  Is it possible to take walks with the two?  Or get to the mall and just browse around?  What about the friends you have with kids?  You guys can have play dates once or twice a week.  Do lunch at one another's house.  I don't know your $$ situation but a gym is always good too.<br>  <br>  {hugs} I know it seems like it will be this way forever, but it'll get better.  TAke it one day at a time and know your kids love you forever cos you're their mommy.  If you ever want to chat feel free to email.|`|6VbNJOtfaa	My sister would burst into tears and call my mom and have her come spend the night to take care of her baby.  You need a person in your life that can take the kids off your hands.  You need a break; you have a full time job that never ends.  Talk with your fiance and make that clear.  Even a few hours here and there would make a world of difference.  I would tell your doctor and work on moving out of the place you are in.  Maybe try a neighboring suburb for mommy groups.  The bottom line is that you need to do something that will make you happy- life is too short to be unhappy.<br>  <br>  Take care and good luck!|`|RNphimj4aa	It just sounds like your overworke, try to go online and find support groups since you said their arent any around you. They could probably help you. Some babies just cry a lot, but their re methods to soothe them. And try and talk to your fiance, maybe he knows of some methods that maybe his mom did for him when he was a child. Its not easy raising children, I don't have any but a lot of my friends from high school recently got pregnant, its tough. Remember your not the only one out there freaking out! Look online for mother support groups. Here are some sights I found<br>  <a href="http://www.supportgroupformothers.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.supportgroupformothers.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.familiesonlinemagazine.com/moms-corner/mom-stress.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.familiesonlinemagazine.com/mo...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.womenshealthcaretopics.com/bn_bodysoul_Stress_Management_Moms.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.womenshealthcaretopics.com/bn...</a>|`|4Qb1FNH2aa	I agree that you should talk to your fiancee. I agree that this is normal. And I think, even if it kills you to do it, you should make sure to take a moment for yourself once in a while even if you just puts you little ones in cribs or playpens (somewhere they are safe, of course) for ten minutes and just do nothing for that time. Or make sure your fiancee give you the night off once a week so you can write songs or do something that is just for you with no interruptions. Seriously, little things like this can make a huge difference.<br>  <br>  I also agree you should enlist the help of anyone you can trust such as your mother or your fiancee, a sibling or someone. Even for just a few hours a week or something. I know what you said about your fiancee's family, but sometimes a little exposure to something undesirable is worth it if it means saving your sanity! (trust me I have had to make this choice a couple of times)<br>  <br>  Good luck and hang in there!!|`|cAtWxJG1aa	please tell your doctor.  it's likely a treatable medical issue the same way strep throat would be.|`|TycCeqtaaa	you definetaly are going through post partum depression. you need help. if your 3 mo wants to be held all the time its okay to let hi cry for a bit i mean then he'll go through with it all the time and will never let you do anything.<br>  dont be afraid to tell you husband bc its better to be safe than sorry
JnLoHaoAaa	She should be good to drink whole milk or anything else you have to offer. Just watch to see how to reacts to any new things that you introduce to her|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	Is she drinking it for an allergy? Or sensitivity?  If it's for an allergy, I would consult your doctor.  If it's a sensitivity, I would try very small amounts mixed in with the formula.  And don't try it right before she goes down for a nap.  Try it when you know your gonna be spending time with her, so you would notice any reactions.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I think it should be fine to do that, I would just like call your babies doc and double check with them.|`|X3rQJhVMaa	Yes, at 12 months you can start giving whole milk. Start with giving 60mls of formula and 20mls of milk then 2 days later 60mls formula and 30mls of whole milk and then 2 days later 60ml formula and 40mls of whole milk and so on. It will have to be slow transition. I would not suggest starting a next step formula at 12 months because by 16 months all babies are on whole milk , so no point.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	I think She should be fine. My daughter was on nutramigen for about 6 months. I switched her to regular walmart brand formula at about 10 months, and she did fine. She just needed the nutramigen to get her through that rough really colicky period. I think at 12 months, I would try to transition straight to cows milk rather than have to transition again in a few months.<br>  Good Luck!
eV5E9MhUaa	Yes, always a chance if your sexually active. Wait another week, and if you don't get your period take a test or just go in to your Dr. or a health clinic and get a blood test. Also if your not ready for a wonderfull baby, think of adoption! If you need to talk to anyone you can email me. :) Good luck!|`|nUTJYYhTaa	If you are sexually active there is always a chance that you are pregnant. No contraceptive is 100% effective. If you are very regular in terms of your cycle, I suggest getting an at home pregnancy test. If not, wait no more than a week longer and call your doctor if you still have not started your period.
drI1vsJdaa	I think he's confused about how he feels.|`|NYJgiVxraa	hes confused. he likes you alot, but is afraid about going further right now.. give him sometime and you will see.
Z1e3Cxjoaa	They don't need to do a blood test...my first pregnancy I didn't get blood drawn until it was needed to check for other stuff as well.  They usually do blood tests when they need help with dating or making sure the pregnancy is viable when a woman has other risk factors.|`|98WKYtfwaa	That's true what your doctor said, they don't usually test your blood to confirm a pregnancy, they usually give you another urine test to be 100% though.<br>  <br>  I didn't get blood tests done until it was needed to check my blood group and other things, my doc believed me but had to take a urine test as routine.|`|85V6cHe4aa	No,here in the uk blood tests are not done as a routine thing and are usually only done if a pregnancy is suspected to be failing.<br>  <br>  Urine tests are perfectly fine for a standard pregnancy.|`|RE6GBw0Baa	hiya chick, <br>  <br>  blood tests to confim pregnancy are only done in the usa really.<br>  <br>  i think ur pregnancy tests are fine and im sure before long ur baby will def be letting u know he/she is there lol.<br>  <br>  congrats hunni x :D|`|a67f223481e1f00da8ea5d7d5f8d576caa	Your doctor is right.  I never did have a blood test to confirm and truly, there is not mistaking the fact that I am INDEED pregnant.  I am due in a few weeks.|`|do8pdlluaa	Blood test are the best way to find out.

But during your prenatal visits you will be having plenty of blood tests! Don't worry everything will be alright!|`|TcgUE0WYaa	blood tests arent always done, but it gives you peace of mind that everything is progressing as it should. If you are worried then you should get one.|`|de2a2663fe4b3d02deeeda407aee1db1aa	For what? Are you still questioning it? and if so After a missed perios and pregnancy test why?|`|piCMW7ZCaa	Funny, normally Drs. do make you take test to check for Anemia and preggy hormones... weird, Yes! Go and have a blood test.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	No they aren't.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	yes you should, you dont have to but pregnancy tests are only 99.9% accurate and a blood test is 100% but thats up to you, your gonna get a bunch of blood drawn anyway might as well have it tested
281bc9a14a2a3c5832ce389a1258dda1aa	Well I had the perfect answer until you said you will not hit him LOL it worked with my son. He is 5 and I can count on one hand how many tantrums he has had I also can count on 2 hands how many times I have ever had to pop him. Tantrums are completely unacceptable. Now that he is older he wouldn't dare have a tantrum however he may try to catch an attitude from time to time that is when punishment comes in he is old enough that when you take something from him it actually hurts him. There is nothing to take from them at 18 months. But today if I tell him he cannot visit his cousins or takes his Nintendo DS or Playstation from him he straightens up really quickly.|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	I bet you don't even give him what he wants.  We never gave in to our son, but some kids are just so stubborn.  People always used to say "you need to be more consistent", but we were - some kids are always just hoping one day, if they scream enough, you might change your mind!!<br>  <br>  So, if you say no, and he goes looking elsewhere, treat it as more bad behaviour and give him a time out.  Explain that you have done it because he did not listen to you, and make him say sorry when time out is done.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA10531094	Don't give him what he wants.  If he's going to get his way eventually. . . he's going to keep having a tantrum.  Babies are pretty smart.  Good Luck!|`|qjf1BoNIaa	I feel like I just answered this....make sure your boy is getting plenty of sleep, cut down on sugar intake and make sure he gets warm soothing baths when he is wound up. All kids are different, some are more fiesty than others. The most important thing to do to extinguish the behavior is ignore it completely when appropriate. Don't tell people "tell him no". Just flat out act like he is not there until he behaves as he should. You should probably give him some control though. How about healthy little snacks in a place he can reach. Little cups of cheerios or bananas? Also be aware tantrums can last for hours and hours and they can lose complete control, it's normal development.|`|4c94e705496562941dadbdc5a4680c31aa	I learned this with my nephew and it worked for him and four of my kids, when he started to throw his fit  I threw myself down right next to him and started kicking and screaming at the top of my lungs also, he was so shocked that he started to stare at me then he told me I was silly and I told him he looked just as silly and he never threw another fit it took more then once for my son but only once for the  others.|`|FhEUCrttaa	You need to stand your ground and make everyone else to the same. If you said no, others should respect that. I would put him in time out. There are many who think this doesn't work but I have seen it work many times. I love watching SuperNanny. Some may not believe in her ways but from what I have seen, her system has worked wonders.|`|kMCe7IZlaa	like the person above me lol<br>  <br>  <br>  dont give him what he wants, or he will be that FOREVER.
Ge8xMTgRaa	Why are the parents allowing this? About the grandparents I tell you, they aren`t to blame because they`re not her parents, they aren`t the ones raising her...parents raise their children. And grandparents love theyr grand kids, they spoil them and it`s really not their responsability to raise them. So about them I`ll say no more, but the parents should not allow this and they should be the first ones to not let this little girl do that.|`|AA10729973	I think unless there's reason to suspect for sexual abuse, it's fairly normal behaviour. It makes the children comfortable, especially if they're not used to sleeping in that house or in that room.<br>  <br>  However, if you are uncomfortable with it, then perhaps it's best for you to say no. Ultimately, they're your children to raise and teach. But it's not abnormal.|`|8wezT0h3aa	My 2 grandchildren sleep with me everytime they spend the night...  Eventually they will NOT want to sleep with me, but as long as they want to they can.  Hubby vacates the bed in order to have a little room for himself as the kids are all over the place when they sleep.  I have a room made up just for them with video games, dvd etc .  They play in there but still want to sleep with me.<br>  <br>  As for now they are small and still want to spend time with Grandma; there will come a day not too far in the future when they will have time for the friends and very little time for me I am sure.  That is the natural progression of a child's life and I dread that day.  I will surely miss them greatly.|`|6nUprmu5aa	Do they have custody? We co-sleep with our 2 youngest children(actually the baby's bed is in the same room). I don't see why it makes you feel uncomftortable, she wants to feel safe and secure at night, and she feels safer with Grandma and Grandpa. I think children should be able to sleep alone because sometimes adults need alone time, and vise versa. But what's wrong with a child sharing the bed with close relatives to feel safe?|`|xVEqBjDVaa	Why? She doesn't live with them does she? My twins, when they spend the night with grandma they crawl in bed with her too...there's nothing wrong with it. It's not like she gets to spend every day with grandma. Plus being over in a new environment at night can freak a child out, Grandma's are comforting...i don't see anything wrong with it.|`|hyp3bvhHaa	i don't see anything wrong with it. i know when my parents come to stay the kids all pile in wth them early morning. What is it you feel oncomfortable about. would you be uncomfortable if your grandson got in bed or laid on the sofa with you or is it just the other grandparents your funny about?|`|yOJme5Q3aa	Well, she is little. I would think that to be like a phase that she's going through and it shouldn't be that bad.|`|Wt61EclRaa	I'm 38 years old now and I miss my grandparents soooo much.  I used to spend Friday nights with them.  We would go out to dinner(usually some place like McDonald's)which was a treat for me and then watch a movie and have ice cream sodas.  I would always climb into their bed.  It was comfy.  It can be scary to sleep in a room that isn't your OWN room like at home.  I was a little older then 3 too. I think I did it until I was 7 or 8.  Then they got separate beds and I would fall asleep with my Nan after she read me stories.  It's nice they have her over night.  It gives the parents a little break.  <br>  If you feel they are creep people then there is a reason.  I would hope you trust your grandsons judgment.  How do they feel about it.  I don't' think anything is wrong with it.<br>  <br>  <br>  After reading your additional comment....I don't think there is anything wrong with it..but you should really talk it over with your grandson and his wife.  Does the apartment have a seperate door with a lock?  Is it safe for the 3 year old to be wandering around the house?  How do you know about this situation?  Do the grandparents brag about how their great granddaughter shares their bed? Or is your grandson talking about how it's a pain that she goes to sleep with them?  I'm getting confused now.  Really there is nothing you can do about it.  You can voice your concerns and that's about it.|`|Zb7CtLxbaa	If it makes you uncomfortable, then by all means, make sure it stops.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Why does it make you feel uncomfortable? because they aren't the parents or because they are freaks?<br>  <br>  When my son sleeps over and my parents house, he sometimes leaves his bed to sleep in their bed.<br>  <br>  I know they aren't doing anything funky with him...you shouldn't think that either (unless they are known child molesters)|`|AA10889282	If you have a reason to believe theres been sexual abuse...like the child acting in a sexual manner or previous pedophile behavior by the grandparents I would be open about discussing the danger. Other than this I think it's common for loving grandparents to enjoy physical closeness with their grandchildren.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	I see nothing wrong with it.  When I was much older than three, I would climb into bed with my grandparents.|`|6Z4fKZ8aaa	There is nothing wrong with co-sleeping. Lots of parents outside the USA and Europe do co-sleeping. There are no harmful side effects to co-sleeping.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Erm. Hmm that is a tough one. My first reaction was a little uncomfortable, so I guess that is what my gut feeling would be
PWS0x8Gwaa	If you've taken four tests, and all of them were negative, chances are you're not pregnant. That said, I guess there's a chance, but it's VERY small. Lots of things can cause late, or missed, periods, such as a change in diet, new medication, or (here's a logical one for you) stress. If you've been worried enough to take four pregnancy tests, you're probably freaking out, which could definitely contribute to a change in your cycle. I'm not sure why it's a week late, but I wouldn't get too worked up about it if you've already seen four negative pregnancy tests. If you're still not convinced, though, or if you miss another period, go to the doctor and have them test you there.|`|AA10390690	all i can suggest is waiting a bit to test again...or go see your doctor|`|AA12127418	wait a few days and test again|`|bb7b4M9Xaa	Yeah,<br>  if you have unprotected sex, there is always a chance your gunna get pregnant! Brown spotting can mean implantation bleeding so there most definitely could be a chance. Your best bet is go to the doctors and get blood works! :)|`|tkqV2CI5aa	I had to wait a month after my last period before it came out negitive and then it came positive after 5 tests. Just go to the doctor, or see if you have more symptoms and take another test before your next missed period. Good Luck.|`|dJoE8yedaa	It's hard to tell. Wait it out another week and do the test again.|`|ZobeHnRuaa	There is a possibility.  To find out for sure I would suggest that you have your doctor perform a pregnancy test or if you want to keep things anonymous at no cost visit a birth right center.

Im sure you can find people who agree with you (i am one of them). Type in pro-life on google and you will find loads of people and their opinions.|`|VRSSBmW6aa	i agree with you completely and i think a baby is considered a human at the time of conception also.  I am against and for abortion.  I believe in extreme cases, abortion is necessary, but this should be the absolutely last resort.  I think there are better options, such as adoption after the baby is born, this way the baby can be taken care of by parents that can take care of the baby and the child can still have life.  We also have to write a persuasive essay and i am thinking about writing it on abortion also!
Og09Q7ylaa	If you have been taking the pill correctly, your chances of pregnancy are very slim. Take a HPT just to be sure, but the most likely explanantion for your late period is stress or some other factor.|`|HMsjw3kQaa	I would take a pregnancy test, that way you will know for sure and that way you won't worry. hOpe it goes good
AA11795652	If she is healthy, playing, growing, has regular diapers, but just is small, then she's fine.  My daughter was born on time but was always on the bottom of the scales until she turned two years old.  My husband even asked the doctor if our daughter was going "to be a midget" because she was so much smaller than all the other kids.  She's 4 now and about the same size of most of her peers.  My daughter didn't eat much at 6 months either but I breastfed her so I don't know how many ounces she drank.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Speak with her pediatrician about it. It takes some preemies up to a year-two years to "catch up" with other children their age.<br>  <br>  She should be having more than 20 oz. of formula, though. I would stop any solid food and just stick with the formula because her body is only that of a 5 month old.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	If she is still on the chart (which she is if she is 5th percentile) and her ped hasn't said she is in danger, I wouldn't worry about making her gain weight.|`|Ph3sh6Goaa	You should never force feed a baby.  If 20 oz of formula is all she drinks, then so be it.  You might try sneaking in a little formula in her cereal though.  <br>  <br>  If your ped is not concerned about the baby's weight, then I wouldn't worry too much about it.  She'll catch up in time.|`|HYrs7qzBaa	TRY HER ON A DIFFERENT CEREAL MAYBE SHE'LL TAKE IT BUT, MY DAUGHTER IS THE SAME WAY AND HER DOCTOR'S SAID THAT IT'S OK SHE'LL PLUMP UP ....

You might to have some blood work done to check on her metabolism and her retention of the food.<br>  <br>  In order for my baby brother to lose way cause natural formula made him a little puffy butterball (lol) we switched him over to soy. He lost alot of the excess water. <br>  <br>  Just like adults, babies bodies respond differently to different stimuli in food. When carrots might be good for one baby it could be sickening to another.<br>  <br>  Go to the doctor before you decide to change anything.|`|wfKaV6Ooaa	You should take the baby to the hospital but don't force feed it her or anything because that is what makes people fat and obese and its harder for kids when they are fat.
QRXtkYrzaa	Depends.  Some First Response and Digital tests can tell you as early as seven days after ovulation.  Most tests, however, tell you either 5 days before a missed period or the first day of a missed period.  It just depends on how much money you're willing to spend to find out.|`|jPlVTXcdaa	I took the clearblue digital 2 days before my period was due to start with #4 and it was positive.
jPlVTXcdaa	I'm sorry to hear that!  This happened to a friend of mine.  Her babies shared the sac also and baby A died at 31 weeks gestation.  They said it was safer to keep baby B in there while the other one grew...that if they tried to take it out then she could risk losing both babies.  She chose to stay pregnant.  When the twins were born she couldn't see baby A due to being in there for 8 weeks they said that it had some "damage"...that's all they would tell her.  I'm guessing decay?  But now she does have baby B who is 3 years old.  She could get a 2nd opinion but I think that dr would say the same thing.|`|ROJans2Taa	ive heard of it done lots, it's too risky to go in and remove the deceased one, I feel sorry for her, but id trust the doctors|`|1hciyvKdaa	What medical school did you graduate from? The Drs are not going to put your cousins life at risk firstly and secondly they will monitor the situation completely and do what they can, and let nature take its course on what they cannot do. They are not gods, so no miracles, the wait and see if most likely the most educated opionion at the moment and time will tell if they must attempt to abort the one fetus, but if they are in the same sac, it would most likely kill the other fetus right? Sometimes nature must take its course as sad as it sounds. The Drs will keep her informed, as time progresses. I am truly sorry to hear of the babies passing. I hope your cousin has alot of family to comfort her in this time. I would bet the other baby will be fine if all tests up to now show the baby is healthy at this point.|`|ACyrJQHOaa	hi, im so sorry that happened to your cousin.My friend was pregnant last yr with twins but in two different sacs.One died and than a week later the other one died because there was to much blood inside her.Its weird how the human body works.I would be seeing a different doctor about your situation because you don't want to risk anything.Also how far is she along? my friend was 8 weeks along and one of hers come out and then the other one died. Good luck|`|AA11764194	How long your cousin is now?? I am really sorry about her<br>  <br>  I was expecting Twins but they were in  different Sacs.. my Baby A was normal and Baby Bad malfunctioning kidneys.. my Baby B died at 24th week..My doc did not do anything  just kept close eye on my Baby A growth I had a normal pregnancy and my baby is active 22 month now..<br>  <br>  I don't know about the Twins who shares the Sac.. it is better if your friend gets second opinion<br>  <br>  Good luck to her..|`|plI0WOrUaa	I think if she's not comfortable with that, she should get  a second opinion from another doctor.  I would be more likely to believe the doctor over random people online.  The doctor knows what is in the best interest of the remaining baby's health.|`|52U22fiAaa	It's less risky to leave the deceased twin in there, but it's not 100% safe either.  It's pretty much the SAFEST route right now though.<br>  <br>  that is so sad though, I'm sorry for her loss :(|`|6ri7AYC1aa	It's safer to leave the deceased twin in the womb. Emotionally it's tough. <br>  Having a c-section to take out the deceased twin can put the other one at risk.<br>  So your doctor is right. <br>  Just be supportive of your cousin. She obviously needs love and support.|`|HMsjw3kQaa	Those doctors could need to rethink the situation, If the other baby has passed. Because that could put dangerous toxins in the womb.

WIQhh62Zaa	Well, one person said it sounds like implantation.  Thing is, it's the right signs but the wrong timing.  Implantation generally should have happened a few days ago.  BUT it could be.  Maybe you ovulated later...there's a chance.  You and I are on the same cycle and I'm praying this month too.  I'm trying to be patient and wait until the day AF is due rather waste a test if AF comes when it's due.|`|png0sxZnaa	It sounds like it *could* be an implantation bleed.<br>  <br>  Please tho, I really really hope thats what it is, but I really don;t want to get your hopes up incase I am wrong!<br>  <br>  Wait til your period is due then test x|`|K2jT1z5jaa	sounds like implantation bleeding to me :<br>  <br>  Implantation Bleeding<br>  <br>  Some women report some implantation bleeding or implantation spotting around the time of implantation, the so called "implantation bleeding".<br>  <br>   Implantation bleeding is often brown in color though some mention it to be more reddish. Implantation is the attachement of the fertilzed egg (called a blastocyst, a cluster of tiny cells, smaller than the head of a pin) when it has completed its travel through the fallopian tube and attaches to the lining of the uterus. Implantation happens about a week (range 6-12 days) after ovulation, <br>  <br>  and you can then have a typical BBT pregnancy chart. Most women report at most a few drops of blood -- maybe one to two small red or brown spots in the panties, Bleeding similar to a menstrual period is unlikely implantation bleeding.<br>  <br>  God bless x All The Best x|`|ca39ebd0432705593536475945aac794aa	You should be able to tell now by a home pregnancy test if you are pregnant or not.

AA11614442	My 11 year old children did not have access to a computer or the internet unless it was supervised. Hell my high school age kids to not have unsupervised access to the internet either. I also have software on the computer that logs all of their activity when they are on so that we can monitor their usage and address potential problems before they surface.<br>  It's too easy for kids to get to bad places and bad information on the internet, aside from school they have no real need for the computer and internet anyway. I'd rather they have real friends and socialize in person (Which they do...a lot) then spend all day online doing god knows what with whatever creep on the net|`|BRT2teSqaa	As a parent, my 11 year old wouldn't be allowed to have a myspace page.

Sounds like your ideas are great and that everyone would have lots of fun.  Personally I don't think it's a good idea to ever have boys sleep over and most parents wouldn't go for this idea either.  Have the girls stay but say bye to the boys when your party is over at 9 or 10.  I hope you have fun!

I want to keep her safe and she loves to walk in wal mart. She is 14 months. What parents and parents to be don't know is that allowing them to walk with this harness around wal mart or around the street, gives them exercise and when nap time or bed time rolls around, they will sleep better than they ever had. Being a parent is a work out and anything that gives walking easier, I am game for it. I don't think it is like a dog leash, I think it is a way of safety precautions. I agree with you though.|`|130816e5bf662924b68497e6577df429aa	I used one with my oldest daughter (it was one of those harnesses that looks like a monkey on her back..lol.) I used it when we were out in crowds because she wanted to walk on her own without me holding her hand. I could give her a sense of independence AND keep her safe at the same time. We now have another baby girl and will be using it when she begins walking. <br>  <br>  My personal opinion is that I don't give a rip about what another parent thinks of me. I'm doing what I think is best for my child.|`|488edafbffd854a7df677efa90768cabaa	I think it's a whole lot safer than trying to run after a very fast child before they run into danger. I taught Bible School one time to two and three year olds and there was one little boy who if he started running, you could not catch him. If I'd been his mother, I'd definitely have used a harness whenever we went in public. I didn't have to use a harness on my oldest, she wouldn't leave my side. I considered one for my youngest but she grew out of the runny stage before it was too bad.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	I would never use one with my child.<br>  To each is own, if it works great for your family, then that is wonderful.<br>  <br>  I do see it as a leash for your child though and I dont like the idea of it for me.|`|winmjHAmaa	The bottom line is you have to what works best for you.  I personally hate to see someones child on a harness but I'm not saying I'll never use one- I don't have a child yet so I don't know.  My mom said she used one for me, because I liked to "walk off."  A harness in no way harms your child, therefore I see no reason to worry.  You cannot worry what other people think, you have to do what's best for your son.
g7uMKvEzaa	Just tell her that you like her but aren't so keen on all her dogs ..Invite her to your home of go out to the park or lunch without any dogs..I have friends with dogs too and rather not be in there home at times and that is how I deal with it...I am just not a dog person...Your friendship is between you and not her dogs..She can have her dogs but see you on the side....<br>  <br>  If she doesn't like that idea...Don't go to her house,,she might miss you enough to meet you somewhere else..<br>  <br>  As far as how many dogs she has..I wouldn't get involved..To me that seems like a health issue..But your friend might have a big heart for those dogs and not know how to give any up..I think that is between her and the dogs and the city laws...She might have a problem..But , just don't talk about her dogs and do your visiting somewhere dogless...GOOD LUCK!|`|zhk8o514aa	Call the Cops.  The dogs has the right to live in a clean home.|`|LJkPRqN0aa	well for one, if she is capable of taking care of the dogs and they arent a problem then (its not illegal at least ive never heard of anything like that being illegal....) i dont know what the first answer is talking about..... anyway....if you dont want to go over there then thats your choice. AND its her choice to not help the father with his medical bills, its hard to take care of that many things and she was probably in her right to say she didnt have any money to help. i wouldnt call it lying or anything because heck thats alot of dogs to take care of, you have to feed them, vet them, bathe them ect...that takes a ton of money so in my opinion there is no " money issue or money war" that needs to be started. because she was doing what is best for her and her animals. do i think its right, no but she does have the right to choose where her money goes and if she chooses her pets over family then thats on her. and no one should tell her any different. she makes her own choices and should be respected for those choices. just like it is your choice to not go over there. no one is forcing you to go over there with your kids. so just tell her that.  but then again you could risk the idea that you may be ruining a relationship with her. but it all has to do with choices and you have to make up your mind, to your other comments, you have no ground to turn her in. its not right of you to do anything just cuz she is a "*****" to you. thats not mature of you. its time for everyone to just grow up and possibly just go their own ways....but dont cause her any trouble she doesnt deserve.|`|xBd96wvRaa	Simply tell her. You are not comfortable with all the dogs.<br>  That is your choice just as it is hers to have so many pets.<br>  <br>  As far as not sharing her 'wealth' tough it is not her responsibility to neglect her dogs in order to help a grown man who needed to borrow her money.<br>  <br>  It does not work that way you cannot judge someone for spending THEIR money on what makes them happy.|`|2OS6mq6Saa	Land mines, LOL, our neighbour never cleans the crap, and it can be smelly.<br>  Just tell her, you can't visit cause of the dogs, be honest.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	i would call the aspca i really don't think its legal to have that many dogs unless you live on a farm and it doesn't sound like she does|`|BRT2teSqaa	Just don't go over there if it bothers you.  Tell her the truth, it's obviously reasonable.|`|2pxiK9waaa	Depending on the city and state she lives in, she cannot have that many dogs in her care. It's unsanitary for her and for the dogs. In the city I grew up in, you can't have more than 3 dogs or 4 cats.|`|8cf66894663c74e69b5ed17db7228d97aa	Well, as to the funds to your Dad-shes not his child and its her choice. I don't know if all those dogs are legal. Check with Animal control in your area. Just tell her she can come to your home and that you and the kids can't handle the dogs. Its her problem but it sounds kind of hoarder crazy to me.|`|UuAV4wVNaa	I know!! I have a friend who is exactly like that.. and whenever shes around me she smells like her house... which smells like her dogs ((SICK)).<br>  <br>  <br>  I mean..its seriously nasty and TOTALLY unnecessary ((eww))|`|cY8DgJv5aa	I don't necessarily think its disgusting, but I do think she may have a bit of a hoarding issue (okay, okay, a MAJOR hoarding issue).  Most states have laws about how many dogs you can keep at one residence without possessing some kind of kennel license or rescue permit or something like that.  I'm surprised neighbors haven't complained about the stench, the noise and the amount of dogs.  If I were you, I'd mention this to your local humane society.  Its got to be impossible for her to appropriately care for all of those dogs.  You aren't trying to get her in trouble, you are just simply trying to get the dogs the appropriate care that they need.  Nothing wrong with that.  As long as she's cooperative, she probably won't get in any trouble at all.  They'll just take the dogs and rehome them for her (since that's what she claims she's trying to do anyway).<br>  <br>  As for your personal relationship with her, just use the old "I'm pregnant" excuse.  Tell her that your doctor said its not safe for you to be around that many animals while pregnant (which its not).  And don't mention the issues with your father.  That's their personal business.  If he asked for a single penny and she felt the need to say "no", that's still their business.  You don't have to agree with it, but you shouldn't try to intervene.|`|s4aX6bF6aa	the dog business (poo) might be of concern to me...does she clean it up everyday?...does she clean it up at all?...and what about that wet dog smell when she bathes the dogs?...25 dogs?...cooped up in one house?...something should be done about this...it can't be healthy for her or for the dogs...so i say to you to be upfront and honest about how you feel at her house with all those dogs...especially being pregnant...good luck.|`|rRIiY6Itaa	Lol! Imagine if a dog knocks you to the floor or ground what would happen.<br>  <br>  3 things. <br>  <br>  - You get licked a bath.<br>  <br>  - Humped till it hurts.<br>  <br>  - Or both.|`|JS3rK9i2aa	Can't you just be nice about it and tell her gently that you think there are too many dogs. She shouldn't even have that many dogs in one house.|`|hcH1AQ8faa	call the police; she is probably breaking some sort of law.|`|HMhUKAgkaa	there are laws against how many dogs you can have in one house|`|wiAVa1H5aa	She's a hoarder, she has a problem and needs help to stop taking in dogs.   Yes it's disgusting and surely she is violating an ordinance - fecal matter should not remain in the yard like that, it's a health issue for the pets and for people.   Contact your local ASPA and talk to them about your cousin's problems.

dR4QN0gHaa	My daughter has reflux. Like the first answerer said smaller meals more often. You could try to pump and bottle feed so he can sit upright. I am not sure if this will work for you but I would take my daughter in the bathroom and feed her with the exhaust fan on. The noise seemed calming to her and she would usually eat a little better. Incline his mattress so he is laying at an angle. Just burp continuously.|`|TQW5E6olaa	Shorter feedings farther apart, and put a pillow under his crib mattress so he's sleeping on an incline.|`|AA10494763	We had/have that. He can sleep in his car seat or get one of those wedge things <a href="http://www.target.com/gp/search/183-4932297-2449844?ie=UTF8&ref=tgt%5Fadv%5FXSJH1060&afid=yahoosspslp&lnm=baby%20crib%20wedges&field-keywords=baby%20crib%20wedges" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/gp/search/183-4932...</a> <br>  That will elvate the head so they can sleep better.  they need to stay as upright as possible till you get the meds.|`|zwctZ812aa	That may be reflux, or he may just be nt getting enough.  Have you tried pumping to see how much milk you're getting out?  That's a good way to check supply.  Try holding him more upright when he eats.  It's awkward to position him that way, but realy helps.  Burp him more often and hold him upright for at least 20 minutes after a feeding.  Those are all things that help reflux if that's what it is.  You could also get a wedge to elevate the head in his crib.  At his appointment, his doc will talk to you more and if he thinks it's reflux, he can prescribe meds.  My son takes zantac and when i can get him to take it, it helps alot.  good luck!|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	To me it doesn't sound like reflux - sounds like an overactive letdown.  My letdown "picked up speed" around that time too.  It took a week of screaming through most feedings but then Elyse got used to it and we are here nursing 10 months later...<br>  <br>  I found that nursing laying down or nursing up hill worked the best to help slow the flow.  I know you don't like quotes from kellymom.com but they do have great advice about dealing with an overactive letdown and getting past it:  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/fast-letdown.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/fast-l...</a><br>  <br>  Colic in the breastfed baby: <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/newman/02colic_in_bf_baby.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/newman/02colic_i...</a><br>  <br>  Seriously kellymom.com was more help than my doctor with any breastfeeding issues...|`|AA11537580	feed smaller amount more often and keep him up right as much as possible|`|hzZyNJGWaa	well tonight when he sleeps put some books under 2 legs on the crib to tilt it slightly that way he is at an angle, it may help to some degree, or just let him sleep in a car seat, the tend to be at a larger angle, and may ease some pain
PvnnWE1Baa	Don't listen to them...You're 9wks & 2days today! I'm 9wks 1day, my last period was Jan.4th. It's ok, relax :-)|`|c8e5d630616fd991d57af8eb76b7b3fbaa	Quite often, the ultrasound will change your due date.  You can get pregnant anytime in the week after you ovulate.  I would say that you are 8 weeks, they usually use the first day of your last period.  However, after they do the ultrasound they will adjust your dates based on the size of the baby.  You can expect to have the date changed several times through your pregnancy.|`|PfIywLLyaa	They measure from the first day of your last period. The ultrasound measured your embryo at 8 weeks 2 days. But for all purposes here on out, they will use the 9 weeks and 2 days. That is your EDD based on the first day of your last period, and how they always set your due date. <br>  <br>  I measured at 8 weeks 3 days at my first appointment however according to my EDD (again, based on the first day of my last period) I was 7 weeks and 6 days. The 7 weeks and 6 days is the one my doctor always goes by.|`|n08phNeOaa	I went to my doc on Friday he told I am 10weeks along. I was like what? I know I conceived 8 weeks ago. Then I realized that he count it from the first day of my last period. About the ultrasound, I do not know. I have heard that they can give variable results within 1-2weeks even to same woman going to ultrasound same day in two different places. ;-) Good luck!|`|otFCWMuUaa	the baby just could be behind a little bit in a growth process.. but it cant catch up in other weeks.. iv been measuring a week behin until now.. now im a week ahead! i stick with the initial 1st day of last period date.|`|MuIVICuAaa	Im 8 Weeks 2 Days And My Last Period Was 12 Of Jan So Id Say Your 9 Weeks 3 Days :)

jfsul7ENaa	don't hide the baby. Love your girlfriend the way she is.|`|fnkAajbIaa	if you love her and want to be with her you should not be ashamed of her pregnancy... i don't know if you relize this and maybe she doesn't tell you but when you are pregnant you are very emotional... and you are probably hurting her right now making her hide this... you need to man up and stop being a baby because i wouldn't have been as nice as that and let you tell me to do those things my best advice tell her she's beautiful and let her show off that baby bump and admit that you both are going to be parents... be happy|`|obN6p3Cgaa	If you love her so much you should be happen she is carrying your child and want to tell every one about it...|`|RnHDnSgPaa	then why do you care if shes having a baby!! you should be excited to have a baby with the women you love so much!|`|VBlrL1puaa	You should be supportive and comforting. Your girlfriend is going to turn into someone you dont know shes having a baby! Also she shouldnt hide the inevitable. The more you reassure her that you are supporting her decision and that you are in 100% the more flexible she will be with you. If you are telling her to hide her belly because you dont want people knowing its your baby than that is unacceptable and wrong, but if you are telling her to hide her belly for other reasons, which i dont know what that could be, then you need to explain to her those reasons. Hold her hand when you walk next to her and tell her you love her and your baby. I promise this might make her a little more open minded to your wants.|`|txv7TIgiaa	you act like you are ashamed of your baby that would piss off any pregnant girl!!!! you should be happy, plus what are you gonna do when she is 7 or 8 months pregnant expect her to wear a tent... are you gonna hide the baby to? i am not trying to be mean i'm just letting you know how she probley feels if you love her talk to her and do what is best for her...be proud that you got her pregnant you are gonna be a daddy!:)|`|7clS7baaaa	why do you want so badly to hide the baby.  eventually she will not at all  be able to hide it so people will know then. you need to get used to the idea of having a baby because you got her pregnant and you need to stand behind her 100%.  man up and be a great dad,.  dont be controlling and tell her what to wear.|`|fpyRo8Noaa	don't do that.....it makes a girl feel terrible...<br>  <br>  u should be happy that your having a child with the girl you love...<br>  and eventually she won't be able to hide that belly....

There would be no way she would spit on me again.<br>  <br>  But, if you take the wimpy approach and say "no, bad girl" is a little sing-song voice that is so popular these days - she will still be spitting on you in 5 years.  <br>  <br>  Discipline the child.

You should be making sure she does not want to do that again.|`|RzYePezkaa	Time outs work but at this age the concept of that is confusing to them what works best with my 2 yr old when she does something bad like that or biting I make her stand in front of me and look me in the eyes and tell her very sternly that what she just did was very bad that she is a bad girl and mommy does not like it and tell her very sternly no if it continues tell her no and take a toy away a favorite toy eventually she will get the hint and stop doing it.|`|2pxiK9waaa	I agree with the soap, or scream at her to scare the crap out of her so she knows it's a serious offense.

Grr. <br>  It also sings "Here comes the Sun"<br>  Which I love  ?|`|9XjtEdEqaa	about a year ago for someone in my class's project. i had it in my head for a while too.|`|SoLSd9Lyaa	Oh my gosh! I think several years ago.<br>  <br>  I hate that song so much!<br>  <br>  Thanks for reminding me.|`|zAKFuGGiaa	I think that I heard it like 3 days ago... It's on my iPod and I usually have it on shuffle and it comes on from time to time...|`|TOhrVaDhaa	Thanks alot!<br>  I have it stuck in my head now|`|CdJtH0xdaa	Never heard it before<br>  =(|`|0AkFH1M2aa	you have a really nice name :D|`|58eHufb3aa	like last month someone sang it to me|`|thwLe20haa	just now|`|GfCjZJbXaa	A loooooooong time|`|Jucak0HLaa	I haven't heard that song in forever.|`|ojTcrqAOaa	Last yr.<br>  I believe..<br>  they play music in the morning.<br>  They once played Under The Sea.<br>  And this chimpmunk song<br>   And everyone was like Wtf.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	about a year ago. thank god. i really dislike that song.|`|oGHtaaCkaa	It's been a while. =]|`|pcjOQDymaa	like a week ago!<br>  im serious :D|`|tbeO3Lataa	I haven't heard that song in a long time!

Bu01WfOdaa	I like Aidan James but Tessa reminds me of a pet dog, Lynn is ok but Marie is too common for me.|`|Cj4i2pbTaa	They flow well.  They're not really my taste, but they're nice names.|`|cErLq7f3aa	i like just Tessa Lynn or Tessa Marie. and i'm not a big fan of Aidan.|`|85vDqn6naa	My neighbor had a golden retriever named tessa, i like the name aiden james|`|etHKs5egaa	trashy|`|fD1ZJsUaaa	Great names!|`|ZW1ohMP3aa	I like Aiden james but Tessa sounds too much like a dogs name, sorry!|`|8eZ4NkZmaa	I think that hyphen names look trashy.<br>  <br>  I really do like the name Aidan, but I wish it wasn't so popular. It is a nice name but I wouldn't pick it for my child.|`|Cfou70TOaa	I think Tessa sounds better with just Tessa Lynn or Tessa Marie cause with both it doesnt really flow and its a bit long :) <br>  Aidan James is a great name, love it! :)|`|W55tjTcbaa	i don't like aiden at all!   it is so over used...i'm so tired of hearing aiden jayden braden kayden..etc!...pick somethin more unique...tessa is alright..nothing special though|`|UjcfmjuRaa	wow i really like ur name 4 a boy but as 4 the girl i only really like Tessa Lynn|`|SCErLQ3yaa	I love Tessa Lynn-Marie but Aiden isnt my favorite. I prefer Caedan or Caiden!|`|47M20WOUaa	I like them :)|`|oO4gr7LWaa	i like them both!|`|xkuCucJSaa	unless James and Lynn-Marie are middle names, I dont like either. sorry. double (and triple) first names just sound protentious to me.|`|yBbNzEjYaa	I love the combinations. They sound so good together! I would definitely go with those ones. :)|`|o0mUvgcsaa	I love those names they are adorable but tessa kinda sounds like a nick-name to me|`|NTKzocAIaa	I love them both they are both cute but Instead of Lynn-Marie just do Lynn it flows nicer
prqrQcd1aa	LOL, UM... YEAH.. Considering that my bf is actually an "ex" of mine. I have 3 kids that aren't his.. I think my situation is maybe a bit different than yours though! LOL|`|34VXCyvVaa	I'd say no unless you still have some kind of ongoing relationship with your ex (co-worker, for instance).  Your ex is part of your past, not part of your present or future.  She doesn't need to meet your family to satisfy her curiosity -- and you don't owe her that even out of politeness.  You simply say that you don't think it's a good idea and leave it at that.|`|W8UZebRWaa	Actually my ex and I are still great friends. We've known each other for 10 years and realized we are great friends and not good for dating.<br>  He has a child 6 weeks older than my son. He's in a stable relationship with the mother and I am married.<br>  We are upfront with out SO's and everyone jives!<br>  *We always invite our SO's so it's not an alone thing too|`|OYy82bAYaa	nah thats just to wierd mate, i dont think the mrs will like it either|`|hl5WdXnbaa	I think she is just being nosey...wants to see how you have done for yourself without her. Some women...even if they are the ones to leave the relationship... like to think that their EX's will never do better than them.<br>  <br>  Maybe do not have her in your home, but meet some were for a coffee...someplace neutral with your family. That way you can get a feel for things but if you are uncomfortable you can get up and leave...a lot easier than trying to kick someone out! lol<br>  <br>  I am friends with 1 ex who I see all the time, but my hubbies EX...we see her too much LOL|`|um29wkUPaa	I wouldn't be comfortable w/ any of his ex's over for a visit.  Except his son's mother.  She's nice, treats me w/ respect, and did a damn fine job with their son.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't trust someone else's ulterior motive.  It's a little too good to be true that an out of the blue ex is just that happy for him.  Not impossible, just unlikely.|`|nfzQkvqraa	In some weird way I would love to.  To show you know, where I have gotten to in life.  Another part of me thinks it's a bad idea that may create conflict.  But ya know what?  If your significant other can't handle an ex seeing her kids then you have to worry.  What would that future hold?  Conflict is constant in life.  If you're on good terms I'd say why not?  Then again you personally are having a gut instinct telling you it's a bad idea. I almost always choose my gut.<br>  <br>  Boy I helped didn't I?  Sound's like I'm on the fence even more than you!|`|98qMZZPlaa	I would say to let the past stay in the past. It may all sound good now, but there really is no reason to involve someone whom you once cared for into your current relationship especially when you both have no ties (kids). Also, always liten to your intuition.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	That depends on how long ago you were dating, how serious of a relationship it is ect. If you fiance is ok with i dont see a problem with letting an old friend back in to your life. There are some exs that i would want meeting my child then again onr of my husbands exs is a good friend of ours.|`|xVEqBjDVaa	I don't think i could even get a hold of him, i haven't talked to my ex in forever!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  okay....thumbs down me, but thats just me being honest. we moved after we got married. haven't seen my friends or any ex's in about 20 years.|`|1VdgsZPoaa	I wouldn't do it, I would just be uncomfortable the whole time.  Having one of my ex's and my now husband in the same room and having my past meeting my future.  It would be weird enough meeting up with an ex like on the street. O.o.|`|ki5hZbcTaa	I would bring it up with the fiance first. I'd be mad if you invited someone over without asking first.|`|WMPqVYe1aa	go with your instinct.no|`|F6lZHRkVaa	If you get a weird feeling about it, don't do it. Trust your instincts.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	If your fiancee is ok with it, I don't see a problem.I wouldn't introduce her as an ex though, that could get awkward.

ca9dEvSAaa	Not true. I get stopped all the time and they always refer to my baby as 'boy'. She is a girl. A woman in my church even brought a boy outfit to my baby shower, because she thinks the ultrasound's wrong. lol<br>  <br>  See my pic? I carry low and basketball shaped. I didn't gain weight accept for the belly. 32lbs.  My little girl is breaking that wives tale lol|`|pjgMW6qaaa	I carried in the middle..<br>  Was naseous from about week 7 to week 14<br>  My belly was round and I only gained 21 lbs.<br>  I didn't look pregnant if you seen me from the back.<br>  Everyone would stop me saying I was gonna have a big boy...<br>  But it was a girl.<br>  <br>  Its all myths and not true...<br>  <br>  My best friend and I were pregnant at the same time and we carried the same way and our bellies looked the same and she had a boy.|`|D5cOFZdwaa	it really is just an old wives tale but with my daughter i carried high and wide all of my friends had boys and they all carried low.|`|98WKYtfwaa	It's different for everyone. I'm carrying in the middle (not high or low) and in front. I'm having a boy.|`|plI0WOrUaa	I am carrying out front and high.  It looks like I have a basketball under my shirt!  I have started though to fill out and gain weight all over a bit.  I've gained 15lbs now, and i see that it is not just in the belly anymore, and i am carrying a girl.|`|dW9C6aswaa	My son I carried very low all through my pregnancy<br>  <br>  My daughter I carried her what felt like in my bra<br>  <br>  and this one I can't really tell yet|`|5QDouy4Uaa	I'm having a boy and I started carrying high but now he's very low|`|QSodlfMraa	i am pregnant with a girl and i am carrying low|`|53QQ9KXEaa	I'm having a boy and I seem to be carrying high. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://c3.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/31/l_b33621686eeb4b5c9cddbd633bd282ca.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://c3.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/image...</a>
E5CnUdhsaa	i collect them when i see them...but  i always forget them!!! lol go figure!|`|PDJbNAZqaa	I'm not a mother but I do cut coupons. If I see, "Buy one, get one free" coupon I would cut it out. And I cut out coupons that don't have any "catches". I wouldn't buy two things just to get 50 cents off.|`|PAciPpSsaa	I did it moderately when I lived with just a buddy of mine. But every time we went shopping, he was in a huge rush, so he would always rather skip the deal and grab whatever he saw. <br>  But in the efforts I put into it, I realized how much work it is. You have to check to see what you're actually saving. Coupons are sort of designed and printed by stores in order to make you buy more. Make sure you're only buying what you need, and make sure the gas and time you invest to accomplish this properly are well worth the money you save. <br>  (cause you'll be going to different stores)<br>  Oh and you also have to be careful when buying bulk cause you'll probably eat more often at home too. <br>  bonne chance
Sn72zeBhaa	At 5 months, he could be starting to dream more vividly.  Try snuggling baby up when you put him down so that the physical reaction is contained a little more?  Swaddling in the blanket, that type of thing?|`|fGWoRqiRaa	well... just try not to startle anymore it might be hard but u can do it just focus
812eeffde93b6c9b94520e95821a80a2aa	It's definitely pronounced Dev-er-er. It's originally a French name and there is no other way to pronounce it. If it had an "a" between the "e" and "u" it would be Dev-er-oh. <br>  <br>  Your french professor is sort of right. The "r" is not separate but is more a sound like a short cat's purr  in the throat which I can't write down but watch a french language film and you will get the gutteral "r".<br>  <br>  If he was Foster Dev-oh he would be Australian.|`|CxRJwJsraa	I would have said DEV-er-oh. and I quite like that.<br>  <br>  Deveraux is the only variant I've seen...but that doesn't make it any more readable.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't really play around with it. I think it's fairly easy enough, and those who don't get it can look it up. I think if you make names too easy the story seems fake. Cause real people have weird last names. haha.|`|HBBBcSZXaa	what about Devoreux or Devoreunx|`|tpSSka4taa	maybe:<br>  <br>  deverau<br>  Deverow<br>  Devreu|`|ppBYeYG9aa	Devereux its very sweet and mysterious. except i dont understand something devereux has an R in it and when you give the pronounciation there is no R sound. If  you want it to be Devereux and you want it to be pronounced that way i think the spelling is good. if you want it to be pronounced Dev-oh thean you should spell it Devoh or Devo. I like Devereux pronounced as De-veu-reu though. BUt i speak french so maybe its easy for me to understand (it sounds like a french last name)...|`|PYK3FzbHaa	that name is fine itself!<br>  its very novely if u get what i mean - they always have unusuall names dont they<br>  it sounds really good and i think that once people read it they will interpurit it in theyre own way .<br>  very good name though<br>  and keep it spelt the way it is!|`|ntfOcTnWaa	to me, with the extra "er" devereux sounds like dev-air-oh<br>  <br>  <br>  I say ditch the "er" and make it deveux, that makes more sense to me.|`|1bb6c70b9e4c247334d53afc02c3a859aa	The "r" throws people off. Try Deveaux, or Deveau. Or maybe Devaux.|`|jbpWAyMoaa	Deverh,<br>  Devuh<br>  Devoh<br>  Devou<br>  Devouh<br>  Devogh<br>  Devough<br>  Devegh<br>  Devrough<br>  Devrog<br>  Devrugh<br>  Devru<br>  Devrou<br>  Devrough<br>  <br>  hope that helped x|`|rEs4Y5Niaa	How about, Deveaux. <br>  Whats the "er" for? That makes it sound like Dev-er-oh.<br>  Or it can be Devough.|`|AA10892706	Well the way you spelled it, it is pronounced dev-er-oh. just take the e and the r out|`|Tg6DxG7zaa	deveau?|`|1UXBRzjAaa	Devo<br>  Devoh ??|`|6VZqo1Nmaa	i like it but he has to have a simple first name to complement it|`|Elxuvon8aa	I think it should be dev er ough  name him Phillip|`|Cj4i2pbTaa	If it's pronounced Dev-oh, how about:<br>  Deveau<br>  Devo<br>  Devvo
PCM5fhnuaa	awww...that is the sweetest story! and yesss, definitely tell him!! i mean, what have you got to lose? i highly doubt he'd say he doesn't like you that way....he obviously feels the same as you! and if so, then you've got everything to gain! <br>  <br>  this is your chance before he might go off to college or something. don't lose it by keeping those feelings inside, away from him! ask him to lunch or coffee or just to casually hang out at first. maybe just a walk through the neighborhood or around your old high school. catch up on stuff...you never know how awesome it'd be if you never tell him anyway! hope it goes well!! :D|`|PJ0aI0Dtaa	yeahh tell him :) .<br>  the worst he can say <br>  is that he doesnt like you?<br>  <br>  but if he DOES like you<br>  and you dont ask him<br>  your loosing you chance.<br>  <br>  ' hearts are often broken, by words left unspoken '<br>  <br>  so true xD<br>  <br>  good luck!!! xxxx|`|4Yl2awlkaa	Tell him. But don't be so wordy about it. Just say, "hey, we've known each other a long time. The longer I know you, the more I like you". Guys can't hear all the details, they start to fade out.  Don't worry about ruining the friendship. If telling him you like him ruins the friendship it wasn't that strong to begin with. If it works, it's SO worth it. much better than wondering for years.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	yes you should.<br>  otherwise youll never know how he feels about you.|`|I64JOuMKaa	aw hun go for it !<br>  I mean he stopped his car to look at you :D!<br>  <br>  I say, text him and be like<br>  " haha heey I see you around a lot now, we should go for coffee one day : ) !"<br>  <br>  or email him <br>  and be like " haha I see you around a lot lately , how's life? We should grab a bite to eat one day !"<br>  <br>  or call him<br>  and be like heeey ! I saw you the other day ! Want to hang out and catch up one day?<br>  <br>  Good Luck : )
lGrcLQ49aa	She is obviously in denial about what her children are capable of - best advice - make sure your kids steer clear of hers because yours will always be blamed for whatever is done.|`|yFYFSjwcaa	Keep away from her kids because everything is all ways going to be blamed on you and that can cause problems later on.
jdRKZe18aa	Well not if they were complete strangers.....  I would want to get to know them a little first, have them over to babysit <maybe for free> while I was at home to see how they were with my children, get some references and so forth - then I'd try them officially if I really liked what I saw.|`|OeD2sJt7aa	No, but that's just me.  To market yourself, present a resume with your experience and references that potential clients can check up on.  Offer to do a 1/2 hour play date in their home for free with their kids while they observe how you interact with their children.  If a baby-sitter's course is offered in your area, take it and add it to your resume.  If you can prove that you can be trusted and are good at what you do, you will get clients.  Good for you going out for work!  You are very responsible.|`|CTE2eRgZaa	As a teenage babysitter, here's my take.  If you think the teen is trust worthy, ask them to attend a red cross baby sitter's course that you will pay for.  It teaches baby first aid, age appropriate behavior, who to safely entertain kids and what to do in an emergency.  Its just as scary to watch a strangers kids as it is to hand your kids over to a stranger.  Everything is a possible accident.  You're unfamiliar with routines and preferences.  And suddenly a kid tripping becomes a story of your pushing them.<br>  <br>  After the course, if you're still unsure, try a few mother's helper days.  Have the babysitter watch the kids while you're home and doing work.  Try to stay out of sight of the kids, maybe outside gardening or something.  That way you can see and hear how the babysitter reacts to situations, and there's a chance to ask questions.|`|sR9XV5Z1aa	Well that would depend on how you present yourself and the age of the children to be babysat. Some older women dont have the patience that younger ones do. <br>  I trust my 16 year old daughter more with my 2 year old son than I would my 26 year old sister who has a baby.|`|AA11220327	strangers, no. teenagers, yes. the teenagers that I have ever had baby sit were the teenage kids of friends, or my own teenage sister. But i wouldnt let any stranger babysit, regardless of their age|`|fdnbXfvfaa	No. I wouldn't. Simple as that.<br>  I only let trusted teens like 17 years old who I would know from around the houses around me, to do it, if I was really stuck. But other then that her dad would take her|`|qieTdigdaa	yes, but you have to get it so you aren't considered a "stranger".  Use references.  Start with people who know you 'a little' - teachers, people at church or a group you're parents are involved in.  Plus, make sure you have a babysitter course and even a first aid CPR course.  Hope this helps.|`|OJL0RW4naa	No, who would let a complete stranger into their home and go out for the night? How could you trust them? And not just with your children.<br>  I would let a teenager I knew babysit, or one who came recommended by family or friends.|`|ftIUXfK7aa	To be honest, no. You need to get some references or something - perhaps offer to babysit for your family and get them to write them?|`|ZS8eBOfZaa	not if I didnt really know them.  U need to ask all your parent's friends to tell their friends about you.|`|hcH1AQ8faa	as long as you were over the age of 18|`|o2H6DEHLaa	no

But it's normal at your age.|`|zdO16ELnaa	Who cares Men look at lesbians why can't you look at gays.<br>  Its just your body changing  , its Puberty!<br>  Just do what you want to do just look at what you what to look at and don't care what anybody things!<br>  <br>  P.s I don't look at lesbians I would be more .......?|`|8NFLpbJAaa	Whatever floats your boatt.<br>  but it can lead to problems later if you get hooked...<br>  <br>  xoxo|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	stop looking at it|`|YxFDiEaCaa	Well your at that age when your wanting to explore new things and your very curious which is normal. I wouldn't however let your parents find out though as they may start and think that your sexually active which will worry them at your age.|`|RWYMy7jOaa	no, its not weird.<br>  <br>  I'm fourteen, and although i dont look at porn, i know people that do, at this age we are curious and its natural,<br>  <br>  blame the hormones (:|`|YX1w2KTqaa	ur curious, its cool! i love porn, i look at it almost everyday when no ones looking =] <br>  at age 14, thats when ur sex hormones usually kik in! hope i helped|`|1VnWhP1Saa	It's not weird, you're just curious, which is perfectly normal at your age. Don't worry =)|`|RMaEeZssaa	Just teenage curiosity|`|nkwsRizHaa	lol probably not..<br>  <br>  But if you haven't heard of anime before go watch some then go find some yaoi :) nothing wrong with that xD|`|mpq95NF9aa	It's not that uncommon.|`|vI6tzF7baa	honey... its jsut your hormones at tht age. well most of all of us have went through this stage and want to experiment..<br>  <br>  <br>  at 13 i was giving a ********, getting fingered,making out, lap dances|`|NVjL5Oiqaa	no a lot of people watch porn it doesn't matter what type, porn will always be porn.
5RoYyprkaa	You are still decently young yourself, and therefor you should try talking to her again. The both of you need to be alone, and you need to mention to her that you're concerned for her because you're her cousin and her friend. There's not much you can do to make her change the way she is now, but you can invite her to stay at your house, or go do things together so she doesn't have so much time to sneak around to see her boyfriend. She needs to see about getting back into school, and stop having sex in public places, not only does she have to worry about STDs she could pick up from her boyfriend, but any other disease that's laying around in these places. I know that you know all of this anyway, but you need to stop covering for her and bailing her out. When she has to sit and suffer through the consequences of her actions, it might put things into perspective for her. If she's doing drugs, then she's putting her well being in jeopardy.<br>  <br>  Stop bailing her out and covering for her. She may hate you for a while, but she'll eventually see you were doing it out of concern for her.<br>  <br>  I don't know how much help anyone's answers are going to do you, I'm sure you know most of this already, but good luck.|`|AtDlNnIBaa	well i think you need her to realize her mistakes. you will find a way.|`|qieTdigdaa	First of all, STOP bailing her out.  She needs to hit bottom and then realize for herself.  Be there for her when she is ready for help.  Don't give her money, don't bail her out.
UEtkRU3gaa	Yep.  My hubby wanted a junior.  I wasn't on cloud nine about it, but now that he's 2, I couldn't imagine him w/any other name.  Be prepared for comments such as:  can't we call him by his middle name?  Which one are you talking about it?  Don't you get confused easily when talking about them, blah, blah, blah.<br>  Just tell your husband, you get to pick both names for the next child.  Best of luck to ya hun!|`|DzUxBehhaa	Yeah, he wanted some names that I hated and visa versa.  So we carried on until we found a name that we both liked.<br>  <br>  Don't settle for such an ugly name, your child will hate you for the rest of his life.|`|KeeY8p88aa	Ask your husband if your little boy's middle name could be the same as his. That way your husband's name will still be carried on to the next generation, but you still have the choice of his first name.|`|nVqVV2mOaa	YEAH AND I REALLY WOULD NEVER NAME MY SON AFTER HIS FATHER... THAT'S TOO CLICHE ...<br>  <br>  CONSIDER GIVING YOUR SON HIS FATHER'S NAME BUT AS A MIDDLE NAME?|`|AA11138222	I know someone that had this problem, but with Third, and she only agreed to it if they could call him by a nickname because she didn't want three Lawrences in the family.  So she found out that Tripp is a nickname sometimes used for "The third", so that is what they call him. He's 2, and when you tell him his name is Lawrence, he looks at you like you are crazy lol.|`|hSTNMnFPaa	Ask him why he doesn't want his son to have his own identity. No offense, but making your son a JR has always seemed a bit narcissistic to me. <br>  <br>  In the end, you're the one carrying the child, so you have the final decision on his name. Hopefully, your husband will love him no matter what his name is.<br>  ? Qǖ???|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Why not just use his first name as a middle name?Because personally all the Jr's  know hate being named after their dads.It may mean something to him.But maybe think of the child he may not want his dads name and may want something more Original.No I never had this happen and if it did I may compromise and use his first name as a middle name.|`|euFDn0FBaa	I completely understand-I personally don't like the JR things.  The only thing I can say is have the baby go by the middle name.|`|47M20WOUaa	I think that its all about compermizing I would tell him "I will let you have your way this time but next time I get to name the baby and you have no say so"|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I personally hate Jr's. I think it just creates confusion in the household, not to mention with paperwork and such...and may create feelings of having to "live up" to his name for the child. I would mever do that to my child. I believe that a unique, individual child should have a unique, individual name- not a recycled one.<br>  <br>  My husband has not mentioned wanting a Jr. but I would be okay with it I guess if he REALLY wanted it. I like my husband's name- it's Matthew Daniel. He has said that he likes ths name Mason for a boy...Mason sounds dumb with our last name though so I won't let him use it.

hKJIDdVqaa	I had my tubes cauterized (burned) after the C-section birth of my 3rd child.  the reason I did it was for medical reasons.  It would not be in my best interest to carry another child, as it would probably kill me.    It went fine. It did not hurt.  In my case they took a piece of the tube out and burnt the ends.<br>    I would not recommend a young lady getting this procedure done.  You are too young, have too few children and will most definitely change your mind in the Future.  The procedure is nearly impossible to reverse and if reversed will have a large chance of resulting in a tubal pregnancy.  I regret having it done and was pushed into it by my DR.  If anything have them band your tubes, because you can get the bands removed if you change your mind. Or use the pill.  Unless you have medical problems such as I did.  If you have a csection that do it after wards, if you have a natural birth they will usually do it a while after to give you a chance to think, or they will do it after the birth if you have signed the paper work.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	I have  had it done, and here with two kids, even though you are young they will do it. it does hurt healing, but it is a sure thing, where clamps can  slip or come off over time. i had a c section at the same time and could still feel  where they burned my tubes, but  i would do it again.|`|qSmCA82Aaa	I did!  I had mine cut and burned.  I'm 26 and have three kids.  It does not hurt at all.  They did it when my daughter was six weeks old they made a tiny cut in my belly button and by my pucic bone.  You cant even see where they did it.  I was at the hospital maybe a total of 4 hours.<br>  <br>  Now can I please give you advice?  DONT DO IT!!!   I regret mine so much.  I know I have three but the fact of knowing that I will never again have a baby really does break my heart.  Your young.  You don't know what you will feel like in 4 years from now.   Why do't you look into the Mirena?  It's not a pill you would have to take and if in 4 years you still didnt want anymore then do it, but seriously ~ You don't want to be like me regretting it.<br>  <br>  BTW~ In my state (Oklahoma) they wont tie your tunes unless you are 24 AND/OR have three children.|`|UgX5WeGPaa	I've neve done it, and have never thought about it but i disagree with the person who says not to listen to everyone you know whats best.  <br>  <br>  i am older and i can say that your plans, thoughts, wants, beliefs change OFTEN!!! i was alot different at 21 than i am now at almost 30.. give it time. really... i can say from experience that you NEVER know whats gonna happen?? NEVER!!! your life can change in an instant. and like lauren said (and btw lauren, i never knew that and i'm very sorry!!) you just might regret it!|`|prqrQcd1aa	My mom had hers cut and burned. She had to stay in the hospital over night and yeah it hurt. They cut your falopian tubs and burn about 1/4 inch section of of either side.|`|52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	I had mine cut tied and burned.<br>  <br>  You are too young and don't have enough kids.  They won't do it.<br>  <br>  And YES it hurts.|`|OGCohFyNaa	I can't answer from experience, but I've been asking around about this too since I'm getting mine done as well - likely within the next week or so!<br>  <br>  Anyway - here's the info that I've gotten so far: If you have a vaginal birth, they will likely do it the next day - it's an outpatient surgery, so the recovery is supposed to be fairly easy. My doctor said that they go in through your belly button - just a small incision. I'm not exactly sure about procedure after that. I've never heard of anyone who has had a bad experience with it. <br>  If you have a C-Section, they do it while they've still got you open - and I imagine that since you're already going to be recovering from that that you wouldn't really notice the difference... I bet that it's not going to be particularly comfortable either way - but I doubt it's TOO bad, otherwise women wouldn't do it. <br>  <br>  *Edit*  Don't let people give you a hard time just because you're young. If you know you can handle 2 kids, but aren't sure about more, I think you're doing the right thing! Only you know what you can deal with and how much would be too much. I'm 25 and getting my tubes tied after this baby (which is my second baby also) <br>  I want to be able to offer my children more out of life than I had as a kid (what parent doesn't, right?) and I know I'm capable of doing that with two children, but I doubt if I would be able to do that with more than two. I want to be able to spoil my kids (if they deserve it! LOL) and I want to know that I can do that - with more than two kids, I just don't feel secure that I would have that ability. <br>  You know what is right for your situation. Best of luck!
2pxiK9waaa	Robeez is a great soft soled shoe. They're fine for in the summer, but your baby can't really walk in them if they are used outdoors. They're not made for outdoor use. Some swear by Stride Rite, but I LOVE Preschoolians. They have a little window that lets you see that your child's shoe is the right size with plenty of wiggle room and then you'll know if your child's shoes are too tight, as well. They're wonderful!|`|ck5edW9kaa	Go to a Stride Rite store, they are great!!!|`|02xxwMRBaa	i bought my daughter shoes from here and they are great. <br>  and fyi the worst shoes to buy a toddler, converse chuck taylors.. ugh, they are horribly difficult to put on a toddlers foot.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.striderite.com/jump.jsp?itemID=0&itemType=HOME_PAGE&goo_kwid=rite_stride" rel="nofollow">http://www.striderite.com/jump.jsp?itemI...</a>|`|lwWicZCwaa	I bought my nephew shoes from here.

AA10624857	The only 100% effective birth control method is abstinence from sexual activity.  When used as directed, combination oral contraceptives have a rate of effectiveness that is about 94-99%.  If you use the pill exactly as directed and also use a condom than you'll reduce your risk of pregnancy even further.  There are other birth control methods that you can discuss with your doctor.  Hormone shots and implants have a slightly better rate of protecting against pregnancy than the pill does.  Your doctor is your best resource to discuss your options and what might work best for you.  Each birth control method has pros and cons as well as side effects to be aware of.  If you definitely don't want to get pregnant, abstinence is your best choice, but there are many options to help reduce the risk.|`|obN6p3Cgaa	99% so it work...|`|vue9NOhYaa	No birth control method is 100%.  Pills, used carefully and correctly, are better than 99% ... but pregnancy is still possible. Even if you use both pills AND condoms, pregnancy is still possible, but of course the risk is lower.<br>  <br>  If an unplanned pregnancy would be a disaster for you -- then abstinance is your only option.  Otherwise, speak to your doctor about the best birth control methods for you. (The 'best' pill depends on many factors, and is something to be discussed with the doctor.)|`|WigKJFOiaa	no method is truly 100% safe,it says so on the packages.when used as directed methods are 99.9% effective.there is always that slight chance every time,so read the provided instructions and "play" safe every time.If it will put your mind as ease use both the pill and condoms.|`|OXSOch9Oaa	There is no form of birth control that is ever 100% effective besides abstinence.  Use a condom with the pills and you're 99.9% protected, but there's still room for mistakes.|`|RoTLnFGZaa	no birth control pill is one hundred percent effective.<br>  most are over ninety nine percent though.<br>  take them every day at the exact same time & don't skip makes it that much more effective.<br>  use a condom too!|`|UdatjYEQaa	no they do NOT cover %100<br>  i believe it's around 98%<br>  but, you should still use condoms, even if there thin ones<br>  because there like 99%<br>  and with both, you should be perfectly fine:)<br>  be sure to invest in some condoms;)|`|nrPabv5kaa	nothing is ever considered 100%.  I would use both to be safe because i have known a few people who have used just birth control pills and became pregnant.<br>  <br>  best of luck|`|698b3b0b5ebf7083a923b4bde2eb3921aa	I think they are 97% effectively antibiotics will mess up the pill so if you have to be on them you will need to use other forms of protection for the whole time you are on them|`|L6d01i5Naa	if you take your pill exactly as directed and you never miss then it is 99% effective.|`|loH00aqNaa	Nothing is 100% man.

AA10666218	You look great--dont listen to the comment about twins--people keep saying that to me too (I'm at 22 weeks right now). :Are you sure you're not having two?" By now they would have been able to tell you if you were having twins from your ultrasound(s). You look like you are still skinny, and all baby! Enjoy your bump--I think it's one of the coolest experiences ever.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	You look normal for 17 weeks, is this your first pregnancy? If so that's probably why you are showing more than some people. As long as your doctor thinks you are growing and everything's healthy, I wouldn't be concerned with some people's negative opinions on here saying you're too big for how far along you are. Every woman's body is different. Congrats you look just fine!|`|sxmQSpagaa	you're really really big for 17 weeks. make sure they do the ultrasound at 20 weeks pretty closely, you could have twins.. if not, get ready for everyone to tell you you're bigger than a house and definitely having twins whenever you're in public.|`|AA10458750	Looking like you're still in the chunky kid stage and it hasn't "popped" yet....no offense, we all went through that stage!|`|qLjNzhxDaa	Congratulations firstly!

5axGfFofaa	Go to my profile (click on my name) and read several questions I have answered about the monitor. Due to 2 miscarriages, I have become a pro with the monitor!  IN Dec., I used it first time (irregular cycles due to m/c in Aug)....Found out Christmas Eve I was pregnant!  Unfortunately, I lost the baby again (very early).  In jan, I used it to know I was ovulating after the m/c and all looked well.  So, in Feb, we decided to try again and guess what...I am pregnant again!  I am 2/2 with the monitor.  Please, Pray for my baby!<br>  <br>  Anyway, that was my success story.  Now here is the answer to your ???:<br>  <br>  You need to hit the "M" button the around the first time you get up to pee on the day AFTER your period starts.  It counts the day after as day 1.  You have a 3 hour window either way to test from then on (ie, I hit mine arund 6:30  B/c that is when I get up for work.  From then on, I can hit the on button every day b/w 3:30 am - 9:30 am.)  Do not miss turning it on any days of you could mess up your results.  When reading the directions, I was nervous but it was easier than the instructions make it sound.  Around day 6, a stick will start to flash.  That indicates you pee on a stick and insert.  In about 5 minutes you will have your fertilitly status.  Keep testing until it tells you to  stop.  Mine always uses sticks in increments of 10 so you may use 10 or 20 sticks your first month but after that, it should be down to 10.  <br>  Good luck!

LFXTpqfdaa	If your stomach gets hard during your "cramps" then they might be either Braxton-Hicks or mild contractions. You're going to want to start timing them. Drink a full two glasses of water, lie down if you can and see how many you have in an hour. If it's more than 6, call your OB immediately because it could be preterm labor.|`|BsDv3k5iaa	Could be braxton hicks.

uGqYoZNEaa	Girl, I have been there.  I made a book with pictures of daddy and him doing stuff together.  It was their book and my son could read it whenever.  I put a jar full of m&M's full to the top and told him he could have one every day that his daddy was gone.  Then as R&R came I would count out the exact number so it was a match.  Pray together at night to send him all your guys love.  It makes it a little better, but it is hard don't get me wrong.  The more routine you involve in his little life the better.  Have you husband write letters before he leaves so your son can pull them out in different moments.  Like when he becomes a big brother, when he is the big boy of the house helping you, when he's had an  awesome day at home/preschool/gparents, had a good drawing.  Just give him lots of love.  Do you have any other military wives around where you both live?  Usually getting together with them and their kids, being in that similar situation will also help you with your hormones for now and when the baby is born.  Will u have nay help then?  I worry cos that is always difficult too when they are so far away and you just want your hubby.  {hugs}|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	I don't think you need to at that age.  You just need to stay calm and make it perfectly normal that his dad won't be around for a while.  You could say "Daddy's gone away for a bit but that's OK because mummy is here and we can have fun."|`|AA10120592	i know exactly how you feel. my baby was 2 months and my oldest was 3 when my hubby went for 6 months. it was really hard, and those baby hormones do not help. As long as you keep your son busy, he may not really notice that daddy isn't there. Which tends to be harder on daddy, really, they feel like their child has forgotten them. 3 is actually and easier age for this to happen than 5 or 6. Now that my daughter is 5 she gets upset with my hubby being gone for a week. Don't mention daddy everyday, if your son gets upset out of no where, re-explain that daddy is gone for work, and then re-direct his attention to something fun. Also the base should have a Family Readiness center, and you can go there if you have big transition problems. <br>  You should also find a way to keep yourself busy, and find where you can get some help when the baby is born. If you feel like everything is just too much, be sure to go to your doctor, cause those baby blues may get worse with all the emotional stress. Its going to be hard, but i'm sure you'll be fine in the end. Good Luck.|`|2pxiK9waaa	Well, he can talk with a webcam, if it's allowed where he's deployed. You should have Daddy tape record himself reading several books so that your son can listen to it at bedtime. Make sure the new baby listens to that, as well. You could even do video recordings of him reading or even just saying goodnight, I love you, etc. so your son "sees" him each day. Make sure Dad has a camera, and that you do, too. You guys should be able to email back and forth, too. You can continue to say that Daddy's at work, that's not changing. You'll both adjust and your son will get the idea.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	I like the tape recording books idea in answer number one. Also you could have him make a few videos of him talking to your son before he goes if he has time. Have lots of pictures of him around the house and in your sons room. Also make a scrap book for him to look at whenever he wants. And for the new baby make sure you show him/her your hubbys pic all the time so she/he gets used to his face. Good luck! Be strong!
AA12033653	Your hospital can be where ever you want it to be.  I live about 20 mins from the hospital I will be delivering at.  There are 2 hospitals closer to my house, one of which is on the way to my hospital and my OB is based in that hospital, he however has permissions at the hospital I have decided to deliver at.  <br>  <br>  You can find an OBGyn 2 ways...First find an OB that you like, then pick a hospital that that OB has permissions at.

Without the hyphen, then 9/10.<br>  <br>  Martha Rose = 6/10.  Having 2 old-fashioned names is taking a bit of a risk, but it sounds nice.<br>  <br>  Olivia Jade = 5/10.

That's just the way it works.|`|buoqtZeFaa	I also have had about 4 or 5 ultrasound that all said girl.  I do have a lot of pink stuff but I still feel a strong boy vibe.

gzFNg0NOaa	This is what I went through last month, and what I'm going through now. Last month I decided not to try, and then by the end of the month my best friend of 8 years found out she was pregnant and I went over to her house and we talked and she showed me the gifts her sister sent her and it was all so exciting I was trying to figure out why I had decided not to.. So, this month I want to try and I am still figuring out if I should or not, I just think I think about it too much. I will be 23 this year, my boyfriend will be 24, we live together and everything is going great. We're not getting any younger and I am supper happy so why not? But the thought still crosses my mind. It's a big step to take and I don't want to have to go through any struggles, which is mainly why I'm indecisive.. I'm waiting on my epiphany(lol). Im sure you are ready too, and I hope you get your epiphany soon as well. Goodluck, and lots of baby dust your way =)**************************************...|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	of course, I think most women wonder about being a good mommy.

When I was having my kids, we used to 1) buy a baby name book at the store  2.) use our heads or 3)name our children after a family member (which no one seems to do anymore). What is the BIG DEAL?<br>  Believe me, a name doesn't make much difference, its the love you give the child, the family life, the nurturing. Not the name. Just pick a name and go with it. Its really not that hard.<br>  Traditional names are the best. They last forever, and are STRONG and NOBLE. And, they have CLASS. These trendy fly by night names come and go with the times. And by the time your child is grown up, the name will sound ridicilous. Go with a normal name. Like Thomas, Michael, Joseph, Victoria, Elizabeth, etc. etc.|`|NTqokGn0aa	Elisabeth Louella<br>  Cassia Rose<br>  Miya Rae<br>  Heather Belle<br>  Krisyne Lee<br>  Moira Noelle<br>  Alexis Rain<br>  Elizabeth Erin<br>  Kidelyn (like ky-duh-lynne) Shaine<br>  :]<br>  hope i helped!<br>  best wishes!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Kaeden Jacob<br>  Shane Kalvin<br>  Ryan Christopher<br>  Christian Lee<br>  Jonathan Peter<br>  Thomas John<br>  Steven Christopher<br>  Joseph Shane<br>  Anthony David|`|FY7WMg4Oaa	i like the names jodi and tatum. today i heard the name bahiyah and i fell in love with it! like baheeyah its nice i guess im into those types of names|`|JOVWBOOCaa	Ava Marie<br>  Alexander James<br>  Isabella Rose<br>  Victoria Lynn<br>  Elizabeth Anne<br>  James Michael<br>  Anna Marie|`|9z5YJKqLaa	ohh annabel lee would be pretty|`|vR7Bew2Xaa	Micki Autumn London Rose<br>  Giovanna Lee<br>  Lotta May<br>  <br>  William Thomas<br>  Charlie Thomas<br>  Jasper Lee Thomas<br>  <br>  (I promised to keep the name micki in the family, and thomas is my fathers name, and Lee is my mother's middle name)|`|1rcibKjmaa	Girls:<br>          Emily<br>          Hayley<br>          Isabella<br>          Olivia<br>          Rachel <br>          Leanne<br>  <br>   are some of my favourite girls names<br>  <br>  Boys:<br>          Joseph<br>          Joe <br>          Joshua<br>          Kevin<br>          Michael<br>  <br>  are some of my favourite boys names.|`|TTyYx3vqaa	I love:<br>  <br>  Victoria Lynn <br>  Olivia Jane<br>  Genevieve Rose<br>  Scarlett Anne<br>  <br>  William Thomas<br>  John Christopher<br>  John Michael<br>  Seth Aaron|`|4dXSD60Zaa	girls:<br>  lilly anne<br>  lou anne<br>  heidi jean<br>  heidi anne<br>  elizabeth lou<br>  penny jean<br>  hilde ashton<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  boys:<br>  benjamin brady<br>  brody glenn<br>  zackary james<br>  louis rock<br>  michael ty|`|aUosbTqqaa	What about Chris, David , Daniel , John, Jay, Chad, Richie, Eddie, Tim...|`|EyuVuMxEaa	Isabella Grace<br>  Sara Elizabeth<br>  <br>  Joshua Lane|`|WBf2V8vSaa	I like annabelle.|`|eex3z59Saa	i like elizabeth<br>  riley<br>  mia<br>  bella<br>  melody<br>  kristie<br>  kelsy<br>   or for boys<br>  nick<br>  peter<br>  anthony<br>  anderew<br>  christian

Colton is probably my favorite, just because it has the most nicknames and it's unique without being so in your face. Elijah is strong and Biblical, which is what I love about that name (would you call him Eli?). Levi is cool, but it reminds me of the demin company. As for the girls, I'm not sure. I like Riley, but I'm kind of on the fence about Raeleigh. Is Reighlyn pronounced like Rylan? If so, I love the name Rylan, though I prefer it for a boy. Reagan is my favorite out of the three girls names.|`|ZW1ohMP3aa	I like Levi and Elijah a lot, but I dislike all of the girls names, sorry.|`|ePZi2zPGaa	Levi and Elijah are very cute.<br>  Reagen for the girl.|`|47M20WOUaa	I like Colton :)|`|sR9XV5Z1aa	Levi sounds great, not fond of the others though.|`|f5yIF5CFaa	Colton is our pick for a boy's name when we have a son!

oXzHvsBpaa	I gave birth 4 months ago. We still haven't had sex yet. No you are supposed to wait 6 weeks or till your doctor gives you the okay.|`|M5E3mDBJaa	I am a foster/adoptive mom so I don't have the postpartum period to blame of lack of sexual activity.  My newborn daughter is just over 3 weeks old and we have only been sexually active twice in the past month.|`|Grmsgziaaa	3 months? 6 weeks. Thats the norm unless you tore.<br>  I had a c section at ws told to wait 6 weeks but we waited 10 days. LOL No you dont have to wait the whole 3 months,6 weeks is the norm but many start earlier. That time is given for YOU to recouperate. but get on some kind of BC.|`|SjX72fPyaa	I'm not sure where she got the 3 months from. My doctor told me 6-8 weeks. I didn't last that long though. We started having sex again 4 weeks PP. Its all based on how your healing. If everything feels normal down there and your not bleeding anymore then go ahead and try. If it hurts, stop and wait a bit longer, if it doesn't then have fun! :)|`|OwLcbnTvaa	I had sex about 7 weeks. I felt i was ready and not sore etc.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	It was 4 or 5 days.<br>  <br>  Prohibitions against sex are cultural, not scientific.  Parts of the US moms are told 6 weeks, in other parts they are told to have sex before their 6 week visit so they can discuss any problems.  I'm not sure where you live that you are told 3 months.<br>  <br>  Ultimately mom knows herself better than anyone else, if you feel you are ready you are ready.  Obviously if it hurts, or you feel the need to stop you should listen to that.<br>  <br>  You aren't any more open to infection than you are on your period, the cervix is pretty much closed after 24 hours, and the placental implantation site is 'scabbed' over.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vhi.ie/hfiles/hf-269.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.vhi.ie/hfiles/hf-269.jsp</a><br>  Resuming Sex?<br>  <br>  If you don’t have any stitches, are not feeling any soreness or pain and there is no medical reason to avoid sex, then you can start to have sexual intercourse as soon as you like after giving birth. In fact, resuming lovemaking after the birth may help to re-establish the feelings between you and your partner, strengthening your relationship.<br>  <br>  If you are breastfeeding your breasts may be very sensitive and feel uncomfortable. Some women feel that while they are breastfeeding their bodies are dedicated to their babies and raised hormone levels during lactation may enhance these feelings.<br>  <br>  The usual lubrication of the vagina does not return until some weeks after childbirth and this can cause sexual intercourse to be painful. Using a dissolving vaginal gel available from the chemist can provide additional vaginal lubrication. If you are aware that you have little natural lubrication, you should avoid having a bath before having sex, as this will dry out the tissues further.<br>  <br>  It can be frightening to start having sex again after you have been cut or torn and have stitches. In the week or so after having a baby, most women experience some degree of pain when emptying their bladder or bowels and find that walking in the early days after having perineal stitches can be difficult. As a result of this, many women can’t bear the thought of being touched, let alone having sexual intercourse.<br>  <br>  When a woman does decide to attempt penetrative sex, intercourse may be painful. The best thing is to take it slowly and tentatively with the assurance that your partner will wait, or stop altogether, if you say so.|`|Kbz8XEf9aa	Its best to ask your doctor, but if you dont feel comfortable doing so, wait until bleeding has stopped and you are healed. You dont have to wait 3 months..thats a general guideline..if your bodys healthy and sex wont jeopradize your recovery then go for it! Just know you can get pregnant now, so take precautions.|`|dRKGXQmeaa	We waited 4 weeks, but my tearing was really minimal and I healed super fast. You may have had a little more trauma down there for your midwife to suggest 3 months, so you may want to take their advice to avoid infection. We were told 6 weeks and definitely didn't talk to the doc first. It wasn't exactly planned - I was the same as you and I couldn't wait for it after having my son lol<br>  My H is gypsy too :)|`|a9b3850496c6d2e026d3e06d78b32ecfaa	THREE MONTHS!?!  Noooo-- 4-6 weeks! <br>  I am hoping that is a typo but you wrote it twice. <br>  <br>  It is only 4-6 weeks.<br>  <br>  I have had stitches with all 3 of mine. I wait a week until they are out- and by then I am no longer bleeding. Generally, my doctor likes you to have sex before your 6 week check up to make sure all is well down there.|`|irGE84Qdaa	man m horny too lol most of the time but i ,ll wait unless DR say its ok to have sex cuz m still sore and its really hurts so i,ll wait for sure but m having sex dreams and orgasm in my sleep its sucks.|`|I7Sd9qd6aa	It was a really long time. lol. my doc said 6 weeks, then I was just too damn tired from taking care of my baby, then I got an IUD and bled for 5 months which ruined things. now I have the Nuvaring, life is good again.|`|EwG7o8QEaa	I had normal delivery and sex after 3 weeks!!! without any problems..)|`|Ph3sh6Goaa	3 months|`|nxHztcslaa	6 weeks... at least!! you must wait until your bleeding has stopped to make sure you dont get an infection... we waited 8 weeks.|`|9IOVZV1Zaa	I believe you're supposed to wait until your 6 week postpartum visit to get the go ahead from your doctor.  I had sex the day of my six week appointment.  I guess if you didn't have any tearing/stitches after delivery and you feel like having sex before then it probably wouldn't be a huge deal to do it.|`|uBr7rzJKaa	My daughter is 7 weeks old today and I had sex after the 6th week.

yQ0OzEbZaa	It is irresponsible of her to have all of those children without a job and means of support.  She’s still jobless and husband-less with 14 kids. On welfare. Splurging on video games. Moving out of a home owned by her mom, who’s $20,000 behind on mortgage payments.<br>  <br>  Now Octo-mommy is moving in to a half-million-dollar southern California home arranged for by dad and reportedly paid for with the cash she’s been raking in from her Octo-mom notoriety. <br>  <br>  I know I’m not the only one with the sick feeling that taxpayers will be on the hook for this financial basket case sooner rather than later.  o_O<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2009/03/09/octomom-new-house/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tmz.com/2009/03/09/octomom-ne...</a>|`|Q1PczvzKaa	I support her .

She already had six kids.

While she needs the help, there are other people in this country that need help as well.  These companies are giving her a copout.

If they won't take something back, then you either keep it or pass it along to someone with a new baby.|`|GognIJnBaa	Babies-R-Us used to take stuff back without receipts, but now they need a receipt or "proof of purchase," meaning the credit card the item was bought on or the phone number of the purchaser so they can look for the card number.  I heard the Carters store will take anything Carters back, even if it wasn't bought there.  Not sure what Wal-Mart will do.  Target will let you have two returns a year of up to $75.00 without receipt for store credit.|`|z8YGEk0qaa	Walmart will if it still has the tags on and is in good condition.

No idea where he picked those up! :)|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	18 months- 'bob bob' for Spongebob, 'ax' for Max, 'help', 'boo boo', 'up', 'box' for x-box, 'ball', 'cat', 'socks'.

Sometimes he even comes over to me with arms outstretched saying, expecting to then be hoisted up to the nearest light switch so he can practise turning it on and off!<br>  <br>  He can also say Mama clearly, Daddy clearly, Bye bye (ba-bye), dog (doh), lorry (loh), and there (dere)|`|Jz15JG6baa	She is 17 months and can say<br>  Yes & no - she understands the difference and can use them in context<br>  Mummy & Daddy<br>  Cat<br>  Doggie<br>  Teddy<br>  Shoes ( she says shoosh!)<br>  Lottie (her name - she says Loffie)<br>  Raisins (she says ay-sons)<br>  plus animal sounds - baa, moo, hiss like a snake, squeak like a mouse etc.<br>  She is very talkative, lol!|`|nBlSS6HUaa	Mommy<br>  daddy<br>  baby<br>  puppy<br>  up<br>  All of which she says very clearly.

1499d5ff7bda6bad70405d7fa5a9c5ddaa	Baby's daddy can mean anything from a one night stand to ex-husband. It is one of the phases that can be put as If you have nothing good to say don't say anything at all.  I don't know anyone who would on a daily basis talk bad about the father of their baby so they just say my baby's daddy. Who would want their child believing their father was a jerk at a young age. Some times it happens on accident and they don't believe in abortions. I don't know anyone right now who's lives are stable. No one at this time knows if they will have a job in a month or even a house. You even say that you wouldn't do it if you couldn't support it yourself or with your other you won't have done it, I think the majority of people believe that they will be helped by the other person and the father doesn't come through. I do agree that it takes two to tango and that it is better if the parents are together and everything is great, but life isn't perfect.|`|VCCKfT3taa	People are feeling that you're judging them because you used the phrase "but I believe...".<br>  That's putting your own beliefs into the question and (directly or indirectly) imposing them on others.<br>  <br>  To answer, "baby's daddy" can be used as loosely as a simple slang word. There might not be so much thought to it, it might just be a popular way to describe the man you're with that you might or might not be married to. <br>  I haven't heard it used to describe someone who's married though.|`|PvnnWE1Baa	I'm engaged & pregnant...In my opinion, you can't judge people regardless of their situations. People weren't complaining back in the Great Depression when the 'Baby Boomers' generation was being made, so don't complain now. To me, this is one of those questions that shouldn't be asked. That's like asking, Why is gay marriage allowed? Why are men trying to get pregnant? Why do people smoke, knowing they can get cancer? Why are people alcoholics knowing they can destroy their livers?...It just doesn't seem important because having a baby in marriage or not, is a blessing within itself. "He who is without sin, cast the first stone."|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	Before you get slammed with answers, let me start by suggesting that you acknowledge that there is a lot area between a baby daddy and a husband.  My partner and I are on a committed relationship, probably older than you are (33 & 35) and chose to have a baby.  We were thinking that we'd really like to have a family together.  We will be married, but the most important thing is that we are a loving family, even if he is not my husband.|`|KDb96QS7aa	As I was reading the answers something occurred to me. If you want your answer look at your friends. And by that I mean the generation BEFORE the one to which you directed your question.<br>  The mentality was not born with this generation, it was instilled by the previous one.<br>  BTW- I must say that I believe some of the answers you are getting are because people will feel judged no matter how you word the question.|`|f4HsyUfQaa	It's a term or phrase people choose to use to define their childs father. There are many people who choose to have children and not be married. I support people's choices. But there is nothing wrong with the phrase or terminology. <br>  <br>  I am married to my "baby's daddy".|`|AA12243380	Well, I am married and was before I had kids but marriage doesn't equal stability.<br>  <br>  The divorce rate is around 50% so it doesn't matter anymore if people are married.  I think that unmarried people can be a loving couple and great parents.  Who cares?|`|Plu6OVoGaa	Wow, that was very judgemental. I don't have a baby daddy and plan on having a hubby. The reason is quite simple: It's because they got pregnant outside of marriage.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	Nunya. Nunya dam* business. Seriously, there are bigger problems in the world to worry about then some unmarried person you've never met having a baby. Get over yourself.|`|Hf5doDxsaa	Your first line is "I am not judging you...", maybe you should look up judging in the dictionary.  Not only are you judging, but it seems that you are trying to stir up trouble.  The bottom line is mistakes happen (not that all unmarried people have babies by mistake) and people make decisions for an abundance of different reasons.  I think it would be a pretty boring world if everyone did exactly the same thing for the same reason.  That said, everyone makes mistakes-it doesn't mean you are unstable, unable to financially or emotionally provide for the child, and it certainly does not mean that you are unable to raise your child.  And just because someone is not married doesn't mean they are raising it without both parents.  You are very ignorant and I think you need to get out more.|`|WtTUNC8Naa	Well hate to tell you, it wasn't planned... Things happen. Not saying having my son was a bad thing (god no, i would never go back and change a thing... I love my son more than life itself). But you know, not everyone that has a child is married, nor do they get married once the baby is born. Not saying it doesnt happen, it does. But you can't sit there and judge someone for not being married. I am a single parent, does that make me a bad parent? No. My son still sees his dad, i would never take that away unless my son's father was proven to be an unfit parent. We just didnt work out, and it was best for us to be apart. I work my butt off to support myself and my son. And im doing a great job at it, thank you very much. Just cause i am not married at the moment doesnt make me any less of a good parent or a good mother. I am a great mother to my son. I have a great boyfriend too, that is very supportive of me, and is great with my son.<br>  Hopefully when i have my next child, i hope to be married<br>  Things happen sometimes. You can't predict everything. And you should never be forced to marry someone just cause of a child you bring into this world. I don't think you should judge people that have a different belief than you, or happen to be in a different situation than yours. Shouldn't be so quick to judge.|`|er7NYdRdaa	Times have definitely changed. I don't think people are necessarily just "having babies" without caring about being married and stable. I think it comes down to... it was just an accident. In your generation, people weren't having sex UNLESS they were married. And typically if you were married, babies were of course, the next step. The New Generation has been taught women's rights, with believing they can do anything a man can. Time to get up with the times....|`|otFCWMuUaa	well im 19 and im going to tell you i didnt PLAN on gettin pregnant.. i didnt take the precautions necceary honestly out of STUPIDITY. im not proud that im pregnant it wasnt my GOAL but i do have my life in line and i am getttin married this summer. Just because im not married doesnt mean i dont have the finnancial means to care for the baby. My fiance has a job makin $17 an hour (just started), full benifits for the three of us at no cost and 401 k plan..<br>  <br>  it all depends on the person.. sometimes things happen and you make poor choices... i dont know very many girls out there TRYING to get pregnant out of wed-lock and the ones that are just never really had anyone to teach them different i guess. i agree that a baby should be brought into the armys of  a fully committed married couple who not only has the financial support but the emotional support. Sometimes that ideal situation isnt possible and you do the best you can to provide your child with everything you can. Sometimes those mommies turn out to be the best kind.|`|qesCemuRaa	You could have completely worded this post different and still got your point across without seeming so judgemental. It almost seems like you think you are better than everyone else. My daughter wasnt "planned" and in fact I was on birth control when I got pregnant. But I wouldnt be able to live with myself if I ever gave her up for adoption & after not knowing my real father I would never do that to anyone else. If waiting to have a child meant I wouldnt get the beautiful amazing daughter that I have now, then I would make the choice to have her all over again.. Maybe next time you should think a little bit more about the wording of your posts and you wont get such harsh replies..|`|3CVfUiiJaa	I intended on being married before we tried for a baby, but it turned out that we got pregnant while we were engaged.  We did get married before the baby was born though as I was planning the wedding already so we just went ahead with it.  Our son was born a week after the wedding, almost a month early!<br>  <br>  I think it's just that society has many different view on marriage.  Some people think there is no point...and with the divorce rate as high as it is, who can blame them.  It is just a piece of paper in other peoples minds as well.  To me marriage is important in a relationship, but when pregnancy happens before hand, it's not a big deal.  To each their own I think.|`|ndvSK783aa	I know my brother in law got his wife pregnant on accident and she was on birth control. They were married, but even if they weren't this child would still have been born so I guess there are those out there that do protect against getting pregnant but still end up pregnant.|`|723QHuicaa	My life IS satble without a marriage certificate.<br>  <br>  W live together, have 2 cars, I stay at home, he works full time, Im going to medical training and we are having another baby.<br>  <br>  In what way wouls me changing my name and a piece of paper make our lives better?<br>  <br>  we did mean to get pregnant - both times.

I say "boyfriend"|`|IlyS8KGzaa	For someone who isn't judging, this sure is a very personal and somewhat touchy subject you have chosen to discuss.  <br>  <br>  As for me, I had sex with this guy who just happened to say all the right things to me, for that very brief moment, and he decided 2 days before I found out that I was pregnant that he wanted to try and patch things up with his wife.  So he moved to Texas to be with his wife.  Did I mention that he also had another girl that was obviously cooler than me because she moved to texas with him, and his wife.  No joke.  <br>  <br>  I admit, I was very stupid, and should have used some type of protection.  But I would not trade the life that I have now with my daughter, for anything in the world.<br>  <br>  He knows about my daughter, but his wife and other girlfriend still do not.  I don't want anything from any of them, unless and only unless the day comes when my daughter wants to know about her father.  At this point, I don't know what else to do.  But I will say this, I take very good care of my daughter, and she has a ton of people in her life that love her very much.  I can only hope that the love she receives from all the people in her life, myself included, will be good enough until she is old enough that I can explain to her about her father.|`|vOomJtbsaa	I agree with Sarah and Gracies Mommy, if you didn't mean this question to sound judgmental, exactly what did you mean it for?!  Because that's how it's coming off.   Quote from you...."Why it doesn't matter that you're married or that your lives aren't stable?"  You assume because someone isn't married that their life isn't stable?! Go figure!  That's a very large generalization.   Really, marriage is a very personal decision as is having a child, it's for some and not for others.  I've been living with my fiance for over 2 years, we have a 6 month old son and our wedding is in 2 weeks.  However, this lifestyle isn't for everyone.  The only reason we really felt a need to get married was because our families really wanted it and either way it didn't matter that much to us.  It's just a piece of paper, married or not married we are extremely happy.  We are in a committed, loving, healthy relationship, one of the best I've ever seen to be quite honest and with or without marriage we will thrive.  So it's not a question of marriage really.   Whatever makes a person happy is what's best for their lives.  So honey, live and let live.  What is it hurting you if others don't follow in your lifestyle or your beliefs?  You can't stick people in a box that way, it's unfair and yes it comes off as really rude.  People are entitled to live however they choose.    So one could ask, why take the risk in marriage when divorce rate is on the rise... I believe it's now 60%??  I know I'm doing it, but you have to be able to look at both sides of the spectrum if you want to be able to consider yourself an open individual.|`|NpSVEC2naa	have you heard of a thing called divorce? Married happy families dont always last. in fact they dont last very often at all. i assume your American, do you know the divorce rate? i dont know off the top of my head but im sure its not good. <br>  <br>  just because your not married doesn't mean you cant support your children or that your not in a strong healthy relationship. <br>  <br>  and yes, you are judging "us"|`|AA11476782	You may not be trying to judge, but you are coming off as being very judgmental, as well as misinformed.  Not everyone fits into your stereotypes.  I am unmarried, in a long-term relationship (going on 12 years), a licensed attorney who can support my child, and *we* *planned* to have our child when we were ready, at 29 years old.  And I've never referred to my significant other as "my baby's daddy."  My values just aren't your values.  Does that make sense to you?<br>  <br>  **I have tried to explain why it is okay with me.  Do you not understand?  I finished school, had a job with benefits, a long-term stable commitment, the ability to support my child...shall I continue?|`|E5CnUdhsaa	life is full of surprises...sometimes its a line on a stick youve just peed on...my point??? you can use all the contraception in th eworld and still get pregnant...i would never give up my child planned or unplanned, my partner left me and baby while i was pregnant.....somethings were not our choice and we move forward and deal with it. my daughter is happy cared for and nurtured i am happy that i canprovide her with as much love as i do...ok she doesnt see her father everyday so what?????? that was his choice and if i parent her well she will grow to learn that we are sometimes dealt a rough hand in life but its possible to make it a better one!|`|MR9iBgafaa	I am married.

And I personally do not have a problem with that.<br>  <br>  I was once married to my "baby's daddy" before we had children. We got a divorce and what not..and decided we still love and want each other...and then we started having children ( on #2 right now) yes we are going to get "re"-married, but we feel , its just a piece of paper, and we will get to the whole "ceremony" when we can. But in our eyes and under our beliefs ( God & Jesus) we are married. And if anyone says different then that is just fine...but no one is better then anyone else .Been with my "Hubby" since I was 18 yrs old, I am now 30. ( - 1.5 years)<br>  <br>  --EDIT <br>  "I am not asking this question of those women who have stable relationships or stable lives, I am asking it of those who don't."<br>  <br>  You didn't state that in the original part of your question. If you did, you probably got some more answers from single mothers who are not in a relationship with anyone. <br>  You just asked in the main headline about "Baby's Daddy"<br>  and then went on to ask why "you" meaning us, "are not married and just having babies."...and then maybe its the whole phrase at the end...."So, tell me please, what are you thinking?" got some a little upset at you. Because you are/did , like it or not, come off judging.|`|f4zg7LHLaa	HAHA! i love the "I am not judging you" <br>  <br>  you ARE judging, and you should get down off your pedestal and live in the real world. <br>  <br>  so tell me please what are you thinking.... <br>  <br>  I was 17, in my last year of grammar school, with my BF for 1.5 years, just finished my exams. we had a very active sex life, but i had been on the pill for 1.5 years (the time i started going out with my BF) i took it properly to prevent pregnancy. one day at the start of the summer holidays, we had to do a test. it was positive. for a few seconds, it felt like everything i had worked so hard for had come crashing down around my ears. then i realised, the best thing in the world had happened.<br>  <br>  our son was born 4.4.08, are in the middle of buying a house and we are getting married next year. by which time we will have been together 5 years. we are damned good parents, and don't need a piece of paper to prove this. my fiance is a wonderful man and father, who works his *** off for us so i can stay at home with our little boy.<br>  <br>  <br>  just because you have some crazy outdated opinion, don't try to make others feel bad. <br>  "And "baby daddy" isn't something I pulled out of my butt here"<br>  maybe you should pull your head out of your butt<br>  baby daddy is a slang term actually and not used in lieu of husband. i have never used it, apart from the sentence above, and i have never heard anyone from where i am from, or my contacts use it either.<br>  <br>  you are right about one thing. you are in no way better than me.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	What does marriage have to do with having a stable relationship?  Its not like divorce is exactly hard.<br>  <br>  I'm not religious and neither is my husband.  He's a lapsed Catholic and I'm not a lapsed anything -my mom was a lapsed Anglican and my dad a lapsed Jew.  Neither my mom or dad went to church/temple when I was growing up.<br>  <br>  I've been with my "baby's daddy" for 10 years.  I usually call him my husband though we aren't legally or religiously married just to avoid ignorance like yours.  Or I will call him my fiancee which is technically correct as he did propose way back at the start of our relationship, though this was before we knew what each others view of marriage was.  We used to discuss getting married in his church because he thought that was what he wanted, and I thought it was important to get a piece of paper before we had kids.  Then we both grew up enough to know that being married in a church neither of us wants any part of is wrong, and that a piece of paper is no guarantee of the security I wanted for my kids.  The commitment is what is important not "the wedding".<br>  <br>  So we took the money we had set aside for a wedding and bought a house which is a much better investment for our children's well-being.<br>  <br>  I'm glad we are still together, but it wouldn't be the end of the world for our children if we weren't.  Children would rather be from a broken home, then in one.  I'm glad that we have both managed to put in the work to keep a relationship working, and glad we didn't make a mistake when we were both obviously immature when we got together and picked the wrong person.  But having both parents in the same home and married isn't exactly top on my list of things that make you a great parent.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	Ever heard the phrase "accidents happen". That's what happened to me. I was on birth control and we used a condom. Can't explain what happened but it did. I was not about to abort a child that I knew that I could care and provide for. Her father and I were together for 2 years prior to me getting pregnant and 2 years after she was born. We just didn't work out and it is a much better and healthier situation for everyone now. We work with each other on visitation and are civil to each other. I was 18 when I had my daughter. I am 22 now. I am the best mother I can be and I do everything with her in mind. I support myself and her with no help from her father financially or from my family. I never understood why people automatically assume that because of my age Im a bad mother or an idiot. Frankly, I think I'm a better mother than half the women judging me.

VoQhvrONaa	I'm not sure what someone is supposed to say to this other than "Take a test."<br>  <br>  Do you have any other symptoms? Sore breast.. heightened sense of smell.. <br>  <br>  Sure the things you listed sound like pregnancy symptoms, but they could also be your bowels, you worrying yourself sick, and your period may just have been a little crazy.<br>  There's a million different things it could all be.. so really a test is your only answer, which you said you'll be taking one, so you're already doing whats best for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck with baby/no baby.|`|CQTV4ntqaa	Sorry, but It doesn't sound like your pregnant. Maybe the hormone level on your birth control is too high. Good luck!!
fd1fd50a357b80da51e4a050c31b47baaa	Well if your parents dont feel ready to meet this boy.. maybe you should just show her how happy he makes you and show her that she would like him as much as you do! My mom didn't feel comfortable meeting my bf... and when she realized how happy i was she loosened up!|`|kYfZCy9Kaa	if she's open to you dating then sure!<br>  if not, i wouldn't put him through the drama|`|iL1tYfJMaa	good idea.|`|AA11296427	Invite him over for dinner :)<br>  <br>  :]|`|KmWjsc71aa	There's got to be a reason why she won't listen to you. Does she think you're not ready? Does she approve of your friends? Does she let you go out? <br>  <br>  It's hard to grow up but take one step at a time. Before having boyfriends, friends and good relationships outside your home, make sure you have a healthy relationship with your parents first. Communication is key. <br>  <br>  It's best not to bring home anybody unless your mother is willing to listen to you and you listen to her too.|`|UhZk09GDaa	I dont get the question. Why wont she listen? And depending on how your mom is, then go ahead.|`|iW9GBrg6aa	sure why not|`|50mArJLLaa	how old are you?
nVqVV2mOaa	GABRIEL.<br>  <br>  my names gabrielle =)|`|cyBcZ1dVaa	Dennis...my husband's name is Gabriel and he hates it.  People always pronouce it "Gabrielle" and when he was a kid, he got tortured..."Gay Gabe" etc.  However, it is much more popular now than it used to be, so your son might not have the same problems.  Good luck!|`|K7b3cLZEaa	Gabriel deffo even though it is after the angel in the nativity but is cute. Dennis is the greek god of fertility.You do not want that on your sons shaulders at the age of five!|`|nWKWoJAQaa	I prefer Nicholas!!  But Gabriel is I had a second choice.  Dennis reminds me of that movie.. Dennis the menace.|`|N4U2oKwEaa	Gabriel.|`|ua4SfHivaa	Gabriel all the way! Dennis sounds like an old mans name.....no offense. Good luck!:)|`|47M20WOUaa	I like them both but if I had to pick one I would go with Gabriel :)|`|VkXQq2y2aa	Gabriel  :]<br>  <br>  Dennis is cute too though.<br>  <br>  congrats!|`|utfoP7GWaa	gabriel|`|fD1ZJsUaaa	Gabriel.|`|1KfbgBupaa	Gabriel, definitely.  Dennis is not used much these days, and would  be considered old fashioned.  However, if there is a familial reason to use it, you should.  A nice variation on it would be Denny.|`|61NKzPzMaa	Gabriel.|`|euFDn0FBaa	Gabriel|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Gabriel
3CVfUiiJaa	My son wouldn't take naps at that age all the time either.  I never knew what to do, and if he did fall asleep he would wake up as soon as I put him down in his crib.  It did change though, and since he was 5 months old he's been having strict naps every day, twice.  Now that he is 9 months they only last for an hour each, but occasionally 2 hours.  I would sometimes have to just hold him in my arms and let him sleep that way.  I couldn't do anything, but at least it stopped him from getting over tired and fussy.|`|tZt7fUYYaa	No. She wont. She goes to sleep at night in her cot at 9.30 til 7 (with two feeds) and then has a nap with me on the bed from 8 til 11. She wont really sleep during the day, sometimes 20 minute cat naps ut nothing of any length. Some times she will have marathon sleep sessions during the day but usually about once every 2 weeks. Porbably so tired from not sleeping. We try to get her to sleep but she wont have it. too worried about missing something.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	My daughter is like that too, she has slept through the nigh since about 6 weeks so really it's a trade off. She is now 5 months and is starting to take 1 nap during the day which is great, I put her down around 10:00am and she will sleep for 30 minutes to 2 hours, if she has a shorter nap in the morning then I will try to put her down again in the afternoon for a while, but the only way she will for sure sleep for any length of time in the afternoon is if I lay down with her. She sleeps from 8:00 pm to 7:00am with out waking.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	My daughter went through a stage like this.  She's now 5 months, and takes two 2hours naps, and one 30min nap in the evening.  I just started persistently putting her in her crib, in her room where it was dark.  It was a pain for the first few weeks, but after a while she just started  sleeping better and longer.  I thinks it was a combination of getting older, and being in a place, where if she did wake up briefly, nothing distracted her or caught her attention, and kept her up!|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	right now he's being a little twit and refuses to nap (even though I know he;s tired) you watch... he'll decide to sleep right before we have to leave to go babysit, then it's too late for Mr. Man to get a good nap and mommy will have a screaming cranky baby on her hands. <br>  <br>  <br>  sorry... I am a little stressed right now at his refusal to nap. <br>  <br>  I love my little man but he pulls this bit every once and awhile and I know what I'll have on my hands later on.|`|nmu6coapaa	My little guy always takes about 3 1 hour naps a day. Except this week it's been a whole lot more, he's teething|`|GZzUyJ0laa	a good thing to do is give your son a little time to attempt to fall asleep. i can remember at three months i had to leave the room and let him cry it out for about ten minutes or so. if on the other hand,youve attempted this, and hes not super fussy when hes awake, then hes not a napper, most likely. let him do what he wants to do, forcing naps makes everyone in the process miserable. another thing to remember is babies routines change constantly, and theyre addicted to phases, so this may not even last that long.|`|6nn7f41Faa	My son is an amazing sleeper, but my daughter was a nightmare, literally.<br>  <br>  My grandmother bought me this book: The Happiest Baby on the Block by Harvey Karp. While it is generally for colic issues, it does delve upon sleep issues as well. We tried the steps to help with colic, and surprisingly, they work to help her get to sleep and sleep well.<br>  <br>  Try the swing, the car or swaddling, try shushing too. Pick up this book. It is a god-send!!|`|fsDof9pgaa	Some babies just won't nap... they seem not to need them.  Mine napped, but not that much.  My mom always wanted him to nap more and even asked our doctor about it.  He said that babies know when they need to nap.  Specially if yours is sleeping through the night, I wouldn't worry about it.  It seems to be common.|`|4U9y2pLBaa	My daughter is just over 3 months and she rarely naps. She takes 2 naps at the most in a day and they are only usually 20 minutes. But she sleeps through the night, going to bed at 8 and getting up at 6 or later.|`|61uwsGVuaa	my middle son ddint nap either and he slept all night long too there wasnt anything to worry about the doctor said but once he got a couple months older and was able to get around and play like crawl and stuff he started taking naps but he did things durin the day untill 3 month olds..|`|XfIrOjkBaa	my daughter doesn't sleep more than 2 hours a day...MAX. 2 hours all together..(10-30min at once).... but she is really good at night, she only wakes up once or twice|`|I7sS4w0maa	No my babies are 17 16 and 14 years old, but at the end of the day I sure could use a NAP|`|dl5ZWzpGaa	put in his fav. movie and give him a bottle while you hold/rock him.

Bu6eSZSlaa	I hope not cause my lil one is here banging away at the comp while I type & if I try to pull her away she screams & fling her hands in the air, guess I have a comp genius on my hands lol. When she was around 2 mths I found that everytime she would cry & I would sit with her at the comp she would go silent & just stare & coo at the screen. What I tend to do is simply lower the brightness.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I asked my doctor this question and she said no.  As my son has gotten older I have realize that it is harmful to my *computer* however.|`|I7Sd9qd6aa	lmao, I read this question and the answers and can't help but laugh. I thought I was such a bad mommy because My daughter is always playing on the laptop with me, she loooooves it. It seems to be a bit scary for the laptop now she is older since she wants to bang the keys and use it to stand up. Glad to know I'm not alone. hehehe|`|a9b3850496c6d2e026d3e06d78b32ecfaa	Good question! I hope not because I am power nursing ours as i sit here! *snicker*<br>  <br>  I found this: <br>  <a href="http://www.hps.org/publicinformation/ate/faqs/computervdtscreen.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hps.org/publicinformation/ate...</a><br>  Nope- it doesn't appear so. <br>  Probably a good thing since I have not the attention span for television!|`|irGE84Qdaa	lol same question i asked to my hubby he said no lol but he is not a DR.
VdTBXoclaa	Well my little boy is not here yet but i just want to say i like the name you chose.  I hope he fills your life with laughter as his name truly means.
Fd4lITkvaa	It takes a while to define your new roles and adjust to a new lifestyle after having a baby. Even if you don't fight over who should do what you are likely to be cranky from lack of sleep and adjusting to your new life. My son is 12 months this week and things have just started to calm down in the last couple months. I'm not saying they are perfect but things are getting better. As your baby gets older you will have more time for just the two of you which helps a lot. It's just the 15min of snuggling before bed but it's time we miss, it's time we had before our son.|`|zwJbUbWMaa	We didn't fight or argue any more after having our first.  Maybe it is just because you two are just tired, stressed, and still adjusting.  Maybe once she starts sleeping good and starts becoming more independent things will get better for you.|`|698b3b0b5ebf7083a923b4bde2eb3921aa	it will last as long as you make it last. If you see you are picking fight stop it. Let his comments roll off your back and refuse to argue. Pick your battles. If its minor let it ride. If its major find a respectful way to talk to him. For every bad thing you think or say about him, tell your man 3 good things about him. Build him up and he will appreciate it and act differently. Stress from lack of sleep makes people argue but you have to overcome it.|`|AA11537580	you might need some alone time together as a couple without the baby.<br>  get a sitter or grandparent to watch your child for an evening while you go out to dinner and a movie or dance or anything.<br>  try to go out together once a month even just for an hour for coffee.|`|Ks7lENScaa	I think a baby can bring a couple closer together.  If you are arguing it may be about something that has nothing to do with the baby.|`|9Zjk9dRqaa	it's going to last for ever or until you both calm down and try to figure out some kind of agreement.|`|4Qb1FNH2aa	Chill out, man, you have a newborn and probably haven't slept in 6 months either. Just be patient with each other, pick your battles and if there is any issue that could possibly wait until your baby has been sleeping full nights for a month, then wait for that.<br>  <br>  Good luck, it is tough, but if you hang in there together your reward is a happy family that will last a lifetime.|`|uGqYoZNEaa	I read that the first year your hormones are still getting back to normal and that many women are angry at their husbands and want to leave them.  But of course there are the normal hormonal things and then if there are really things that are needing to be argued about, ya know?|`|IKl1hS4qaa	it lasts until the couple decides that love means sacrifice. yes, more work, more patience, more understanding is always required, that's not optional.<br>  <br>  Once a couple centres the relationship on _self-giving_ love the fights and arguments cease for the most part.
lTkYWiy5aa	Depending on age and other factors, you have a 20% chance of getting pregnant before ovulation (max 33% chance on the day of) and a 0% chance of getting pregnant the day after ovulation.|`|JIrud5INaa	Shouldn't be having sex at 15. Should wait till your older. Enjoy high school be in sports, enjoy school dances, enjoy being with friends, a baby will change everything and you will most likely not have much of a social life anymore! Just wait no need to rush your too young!
wqRwSaGSaa	cute baby :)<br>  i would say probally 50 pounds or so.<br>  trust me when she starts walking and you follow her around everywhere to make sure she doesnt bump into anything.<br>  youll lose a few pounds just that way.<br>  when she starts eatting real food dont eat her leftovers while eating another meal thats a way i gained more weight.<br>  just do simple things like eat right.<br>  try to walk or run sometime when your husband can watch her? maybe like 45 min walk a day or every other day.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|PDJbNAZqaa	Lose your baby weight if you were looking real good before you had the baby :)<br>  <br>  As for your hair, maybe dye it a soft brown?

Keep the baby. They are blessings. Do what your mind & heart tell you do.<br>  You can always continue your career after. They dont ruin lives.<br>  <br>  you can have the baby & both of you look after baby once its born. Or since he is the father of the baby. You can have the baby. Look after them for the 6 weeks after. Then give the baby to the father to look after.<br>  if he is willing to do it. Then he is worth giving the child to. Not every boyfriend or husband is like this.<br>  <br>  God Bless x Babies are blessings x Everything changes when the first kicks are felt & once they are in your arms|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	Well girl, not sure are you pregnant? If you are well then your party times are over.Of course you can still see and hang out with your friends, but NO DRINKING! and no dancing etc.<br>  It's great that you're carrying on with the pregnancy, you're giving that baby the chance of life.<br>  Now it's time for your to grow up and be responsible... you werent before -hence you're in this situation-so now you have to do the right thing, finish high school and become a mom. There is also adoption.. but your bf seems to be interested in the baby!! That's a lot more than many guys out there!! <br>  Im sorry I was so harsh but I think you need a dose of reality.<br>  It's too bad that your dad kicked you out, it's not fair, but at least your bf wants you to move in with him! Is there a way tat you can get a part time job now? so you can save up some money? <br>  I think you need to start thinking that you're having a baby and that you are becoming a mom soon and need to start working on that.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	First off are you even sure you are pregnant.  Before you go off thinking about how a baby will effect your future plans you need to make sure you are pregnant.  You may not be pregnant.  But if you are pregnant a baby will make you life change.  Sometimes for the better sometimes not.  You should not put your dreams on hold because you will be a young parent.  It will just make you resist the baby and the boyfriend.  Just make sure you have a plan, assuming you are pregnant, before the baby gets here and you will still be able to have a life with a baby in tow.|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	You had sex, deal with it. Seriously! This is why teenagers SHOULD not be having sex. Grow up before you open your legs so pregnancy doesn't happen. Or STDs. How does aids sound to you?!?!|`|98WKYtfwaa	You should find out if you're pregnant first before over thinking this kind of stuff.|`|c5AJGcYcaa	First things, life does NOT stop because you have a child. Yes you are young, and some things you may miss out on, but you made the choice to have unprotected sex.<br>  <br>  If you dad is anything like mine, (i got pregnant with my first at 18 as well) he was very upset and hateful about it, til he realized it was not going to "disappear" and the first time he held his grand-daughter in his hands he softened up so much.<br>  <br>  Only you can make the decision, we can only offer our advice.|`|g7wQij2Oaa	your baby will become your life. but in a great way. sounds like baby already has a wonderful dad. <br>  you are just going to be doing things a little differently than your friends who will be going off to college and partying, but believe me, you're getting the better end of the deal. you're not missing out on much. <br>  you can still follow your dreams with a baby.. it just might take a little more determination.<br>  congrats and good luck. you will be fine.<br>  <br>  :)|`|h5cFkP35aa	well if you feel like it's not the right time in your life and you want to have fun and know that your baby is alive and well, why don't you give it to your boyfriend? he's obviously excited and seems to want the responsibility and plus, i'm sure you'll be able to see the baby when you want. glad to hear you're not considering abortion. good luck.|`|xCXyCojGaa	At the moment it sounds like that your feeling unsure of what you want and how its going to effect your life BUT the baby is already there, and at every second its developing into a little human being. You need to think about your baby and give it a chance, your very lucky that you have a man that is willing to stick by you, so consider your self lucky, don't make any decisions that you may regret later.|`|azE51WGRaa	You decided to be an adult so now face up to the fact that you're gonna be a mommy soon.

I would never kick my child out because she is pregnant. I don't care how old she is. Now about the rest of your question, finish high school, if your boyfriend is being a man and willing to take care of you and your baby I would take him up on his offer. Some men don't take ownership for their mistakes and would rather leave you high and dry. As far as having fun, you might not be able to party every night or go to the movies as much. I really missed it just being my husband and I when my dd came. But I find joy in her learning to smile and look forward to being able to feed the ducks at the park with her and video her making her first mess with baby food. I do other things now that are fun like taking Natty for a walk and laying in bed as a family watching movies. I guess what I'm saying is it's attitude and finding things you can do that are fun and include your child. Go window shopping with friends still and join a mom's group for play dates. If I lived in the neighborhood I'd hang out and show you things that are fun and with a kid.|`|uOw6J5D2aa	I totally understand where you are coming from BUT you should have thought about that before having sex.<br>  <br>  I have a 1 y.o daughter and Im still able to go out and do things, Im doing college classes online, and if he is willing to help out and let you follow your dreams then there is nothing holding you back.<br>  <br>  Im not trying to make a decision for you but if you give the baby up for adoption (which would be the only way if you dont have an abortion), down the road are you going to regret it?<br>  <br>  Write down the pros and cons, that might help you decided.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck. :-)|`|6fjrcdYjaa	I know what you're feeling. I was 18 when I got pregnant with my first son.... so, please, listen to me when I say this: KEEP THE BABY! Your dad WILL GET OVER THE SHOCK AND DISAPPOINTMENT the SECOND he lays eyes on his new grand baby. He will fall head over heels, just as you and your boyfriend will. DO NOT ABORT the baby. You will regret it the rest of your life. Be strong! Have the baby! Do EVERYTHING in your power to have a healthy pregnancy... to grow your child in a perfectly healthy, safe environment! If you have your baby and STILL feel like you don't "want" it, the possibility of adoption is STILL POSSIBLE. If you choose to abort it now, there won't be any other possiblilities and no way to turn back the clock. Keep your chin up, girl! Stay strong! Pretty soon, you'll meet that sweet baby and your heart will overflow for it. I promise.<br>  <br>  (Wow, there are a lot of "caps" in my answer, but I promise, I'm not "SHOUTING"! :)
ooNfqGxzaa	Right now I am 12 weeks pregnant and before this pregnancy (which ended up in a miscarriage) I had allott of cramping. I feels just like period cramps. Well, I went to the doctor and he told me that it's totally normal, that some woman will get it and some people won't. Although, I started getting this cramping when I was about 4-5 weeks pregnant. But I believe it is normal.|`|5axGfFofaa	I think I had them...it felt like something was pushing down inside of me and then it felt like i had gas but i did not.  wow that is a really early positive!|`|QFNvYVtyaa	A bit of cramping about eight to ten days after ovulation might actually be a sign that you are pregnant. These pains -- known as implantation cramps -- can happen when the newly fertilized egg burrows itself into the wall of your uterus. If implantation is to blame, cramping should be minor and brief (lasting only a day or two), and may be accompanied by light spotting called implantation bleeding. Wait a few days, and if your period doesn’t show up when expected, break out the pregnancy test. (Good luck!)<br>  <br>  If at any point in your pregnancy cramping is severe, lasts more than a couple of days or occurs after a positive pregnancy test, head straight to your doctor. It's probably just gas or the feeling of your growing uterus, but it's important to rule out miscarriage, pre-term labor, placental abruption, preeclampsia, and urinary tract infections.
2Pp2cDbJaa	Here are some of the side effects of plan b, and they can vary from woman to woman<br>  <br>  nausea, abdominal pain, fatigue, headache, menstrual changes, dizziness, breast tenderness, vomiting, and diarrhea. After taking Plan B, women should be informed that their next period may be heavier or lighter, earlier or later<br>  <br>  <br>  the thing is, plan b has some of the same side effects as pregnancy symptoms, and you can also get the same symptoms when you are about to get your period, the only way to know if you are pregnant for sure is to take a pregnancy test, because you should never go off symptoms alone. If you took plan b within the 72 hour time period and you took it correctly you should be safe from pregnancy. If you are still worried take a test to be sure. Good Luck hope this helped|`|GS0Cgrykaa	I am in the same situation as you. Took the pill on Tuesday and started spotting on Sunday through Tuesday. My boobs are sore and Im sick to my stomach. I called my dr. she said it could be from the pill I am going to see her the 26th. I think I am not pregnant from what I have been reading but am still a little curious. I will let you know after my dr. app.

AA11659150	Well, if that's what you want then go for it!  It sounds really cute and who cares what most people do??? LOL.  I think it sounds fun!  The "baby enough" part will be you there with your fat baby belly!!!  That ought to make it plain enough what kind of party it will be!  :)  Have fun and GL<br>  <br>  EDIT:  (And as an invitation idea, see if you can find a hula girl invitation.  In the words, you can say something like "Our hula girl is about to be a hula mama!" or something silly like that.  Then "please help us welcome 'baby name' (which will let people know if it's a boy or girl." or "please help us line her tiki hut with essentials for 'baby name'.)  Just some thoughts.  Cute idea!  :)
hvW61zLMaa	While you're walking/in motion you're rocking the baby to sleep. Have some juice or cold water and lie down. The baby will start kicking in no time. Also my son had days where he wouldn't be active at all but I never worried because just like us, babies also have their "off" days. So there'd be days where he was rearranging my insides and others where it felt like he was just turning over to go sleep again. He was 4.240 kg's at birth and is now a healthy happy 6 month old. I wouldn't worry so much if I were you but maybe to put your mind at ease you should make an appointment with your OBGYN just to be reassured. Stress is no good for baby.. Good luck!|`|CFFuFof1aa	When you don't feel her moving, drink you a big glass of orange juice or coca cola. Lay down on your left side, and you will feel her move. If you don't feel her move within one hour(time it), then you should go into the doctors and have them do the stress test.Call your doctor regardless, just to be safe, but I called my doctor telling him that I couldn't feel her moving atleast 10 times,and even went to the L&D for them to do stress tests on her 3 times. Everything was normal. That is just the joys of mother hood (worrying) you will do that forever. Congrats!!!!!<br>  <br>  Also, she has less room to move around. She is cramped up, the further you get a long the less you will feel her move.|`|VCCKfT3taa	My doctor said that if I notice a decrease in movement that persists more than 48 hours then to come in and see him. <br>  Then again I had a "high risk" type of pregnancy because of my weight. <br>  If you notice a steady decrease or stop of movement and what you're used to doesn't come back in a day or two then I'd go in for a check up.<br>  <br>  It could be nothing at all, the doctor will be able to tell you with an ultrasound.|`|8YrBbgXXaa	Just try to relax. Drink a BIG glass of cold water and then lie down. You should feel her move. If not, try and eat a sweet snack and lie down again. Sometimes babies are still while sleeping.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Okay, calm down.<br>  <br>  Drink something cold(ice water or OJ) and lay down on your side for about 30 minutes to an hour to see if your baby moves. If not, phone into your OB and tell them what's going on.|`|irHF6CBPaa	At this point baby will have days were he is moving a lot and some days he will be lazy as long as you feel movement everything is fine If you have not felt baby move in a couple of hours drink some juice(peferbly sweet) If 1hr goes by and he still doesn't move call your clinic tell them baby hasen't move they will sent you to the hospital for a Non-stress-test(NST) but baby should be fine if he moving even a little Congrats on Baby<br>  <br>  No there is nothing wrong My baby will move for a 4days non stop and next 3-4 days very little

It was amazing, I met a couple of friends there who I'll see when I go back this summer.  And I met a REALLY hot guy, so that was a plus :]<br>  <br>  My worst was when my parents thought it would be a good idea to drive from Massachusetts to FLorida.  It was 24 hours in the car.  I don't remember the actual vacation, I just remember driving.|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	Best:<br>  <br>  I went to Japan on a school trip! It was so fun and I took so many pictures! I got to go to school in Japan and live with a Japanese family. Tour down to Hiroshima, Kyoto and Osaka. I got to go with 15 of my friends - It was so amazing. I remember all the lights in Tokyo, the festivals we went to, the amazing food and restraunts. It was last September and I want to go back again!<br>  <br>  Worst:<br>  <br>  I went to Coffs Harbour in NSW with my mother. It was by far the worst 'vacation' I have been on. I was car sick the way there and back. She refused to turn down the radio. I then finally got there and was bitten by some insect that I had an allergic reaction to. My mother than got sick and was rushed to hospital.

Turns out he had family friends that lived in the same city as my family, and we lived an hour way from each other in the states.<br>  <br>  The worst was Tenessee when I was 16. We were only there for a weekend, but we had to leave a day early because we all ended up getting food poisoning.|`|64R1DrtHaa	Best:<br>  Zell Am See, Austria. Great ski resort, Fantastic runs, food.

I used to go there all the time, but then we just stopped. God, I love that place so much =]<br>  <br>  -Catherine|`|zAKFuGGiaa	You want to be careful in Rio, some parts of the city are really dangerous... Don't go out by yourself and stay in touristy areas...<br>  <br>  The best trip I ever went on was a trip that I took to Italy with my sister and my two cousins when I was 14... It was winter break and we went over there for two weeks after Christmas. We were all between 14 and 18 but over there we were treated like adults and it was really an eye opening experience! When we were in Milan we stayed with family, but then we traveled around to Rome, Venice, Lake Como, and Switzerland and we stayed in some hostels and so many things went wrong (my cousin was booked on a different flight from Milan to Rome, they didn't book a room for four in Rome so they wouldn't let us stay in the hotel so we had to go around with our luggage looking for a hostel... Even with everything that happened we had the time of our lives! It was the last time we really did anything like that because my sister found out she was pregnant with my oldest niece a month after... Now when we travel it's always us with our kids and while it's fun it's not the same, we can't just get up and go...<br>  <br>  The worst trip I ever took was a trip to Mexico with my parents and my sister when I was 12. It was over Christmas and my dad was a total prick the entire time (we never found out why...) The weather sucked the entire time (it rained) and Christmas just wasn't the same without decorations, a tree and our family...
ADjeuxIiaa	How many naps is she getting during the day? By a year old, your daughter should only be getting 1-2 short naps a day. If she is getting more, that could be the source of her not sleeping through the night. Could you provide more info on her daily schedule?|`|pT7jrsAgaa	Hun, my oldest didn't sleep completely through the night until he was 10!  I was a walking zombie!!!  Hopefully your baby girl will settle quicker than that, just be patient. And drink lots of coffee!! :)
DHyUnhS1aa	I would let her do it.  At least your daughter said she wouldn't hit him as hard as she possible can--just hard enough to get the point across.  If he ever did that to any other girl he would definitely get kicked in the nads... HARD.  Better he learn the lesson now with someone who won't kick him hard enough to sterilize him.  Besides, your daughter sounds like a good kid for even asking you instead of just doing it.  You don't want to teach her that she should let people hurt her and not fight back when the person hurting her deserves to get hurt back.  And your son deserves a kick in the nads.<br>  <br>  If your son comes crying to you afterwards be sure to tell him that now any time he gives her titty twisters she is allowed to kick him.  Because you told him countless times to stop.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	How many times are you going to ask this?<br>  Let her kick him.<br>  He so deserves it.<br>  One time never *really* hurt anybody.|`|FNl3IIrlaa	This is a tough one. I wouldn't let her kick him, because if you fight fire with fire, you just get a bigger fire. Find some other way to resolve it. Try talking to your daughter and tell her not to rough house with hime any more.|`|1enIWBGnaa	If your lectures haven't worked - then allow your daughter to fight back!<br>  Once he get's a taste of his own medicine - then, hopefully, he will stop.<br>  YOU don't say anything to your son - let your daughter tell him!|`|8i9Ji3QQaa	your daughters right.|`|AA12240972	OK, you are wayyyy off base on this one.  Your daughter is 12 she is no longer at an appropriate age for your son to be doing this.  Whatever your strictest form of punishment is you should be using it for your son NOW,  What he is doing is not only VERY painful, but has become defiant and inappropriate since he continues to do it even when he knows its wrong.  Wise up, he's taking you for a ride.  NO more converying, let him know that under no circumstances is this acceptable behavior and it will not be tolerated.  If, and I pray it doesn't happen, he does this at school while playing rough with another girl you will regret you didn't step in as his mother earlier and guide him correctly.<br>  <br>  Under no circumstances should you give permission for your daughter to do the same, but at this point I would say your son definitely deserves it.|`|D08pc5zvaa	OK read this first. the first thing you have to do is realize that if a guy get hit to hard he is unable to have kids and if a girl is hit to hard she can develop breast cancer. now that that is out of the way i can say this phisical dicipline will stop that but if you dont want to hit you kids mail me at bladewee@yahoo.com and ill tell you how to get them to stop.|`|t0magGXQaa	If my brothers did that to me I would kick them in the balls!!<br>  Let your daughter do it to get revenge|`|9NNChMSNaa	I cannot believe that someone would even contemplate allowing another person to kick their son in the scrotum.  That is sad.  You would feel terrible should she kick the &%^$ out of his poor friends.  Additionally, what are you teaching her... "it's okay to hit back?"  <br>  <br>  Check out <a href="http://kidshealth.org/teen/sexual_health/guys/testicular_injuries.html" rel="nofollow">http://kidshealth.org/teen/sexual_health...</a><br>  <br>  Also, how do you know how hard she would hit him.<br>  This honestly sounds like child abuse to me.<br>  <br>  oh, look, it is......    <a href="http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/define.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/l...</a><br>  <br>  Find some honest form of controlling your son.  <br>  <br>  Lastly, don't you think it sad to have your 10 year old son refering to girls breasts as "titties"  .  They are breasts.
BHIiO22taa	Ahh tough one. No, as a mom u should not "give permission" for your children to behave violently towards one another. However, if your daughter does it on her own without permission, I wouldn't blame her haha! How about this: tell them if they can't wrestle without inflicting pain, they aren't allowed to do it at all. <br>  <br>  Also consider that at their ages they may be getting curious about the opposite sex's private parts. Your son may use the titty twister as a excuse to feel a womans chest because he is naturally curious. He isn't being "bad" as he doesn't have mean intentions but it is still inapprppriate and painful for your girl! Maybe they need more educational material like books about puberty to help them explore what is going on. Good luck!|`|DvnOIx1laa	To be perfectly honest, at that age your children should not be touching eachother in those places, even if it is considered rough housing! Retaliation is not the answer! It never is!! I am having a hard time believing that this is even a real question! Why dont you just put your foot down! Tell him if he doesnt stop doing it you will ground him or take certain priveleges away!|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	I would let her. Since talking with him isn't working, Id step it up. <br>  Give him fair warning though, if it happens again son, she will be allowed to give it back to you, and let him deal with the info how he needs to. <br>  I'd also let him know, that if he was to do it to any other girls, he would be in some serious trouble. Not only with you, but the girls parents, the school if need be and the police if it came to that. It could easy be interpreted as an assault. <br>  <br>  Good for you for talking about this with him first. Too many people skip that step.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	the problem with telling her that she can do it, but not too hard is that most children don't know their own strength. If he really hurts her and she gets angry she could really do some damage to your son. Maybe you should allow her to give him a "titty twister" back instead?|`|2jrffIoWaa	You need to stop that behavior.  Not only is it completely inappropriate for a 10 year old to be touching any girl (especially his siters) there, but you need to step up for her and teach her how to have a voice when she is being mistreated (specifically in that way).|`|Z5g7hCXraa	Warn your son that he might get a taste of what he's dishing out.  I would allow her to hit him or get really rough, but I would not let her target his jewels!  Be cautious in this - don't encourage your daughter, just give permission.  She needs to be aware that he might hit her even harder!  This needs to be a calculated risk on her part.  He might outgrow her soon, and they'll have to find another way to play.<br>  <br>  Tell your son that touching ANY girl there is completely off limits.  He needs to respect her as a girl, and vice versa, which is why she must keep away from his private parts.<br>  <br>  If they really like rough play, that's a privilege too.  Take away that privilege.  I once forbid my two kids from joking around, and they missed each other so much that the goofing around is appropriate now, when it wasn't before.<br>  <br>  You've already lectured, so now it's just time for action.  Actions speak louder than words, remember?|`|4Qb1FNH2aa	I say you give him a final warning that if he will not stop on his own, you are giving her permission to retaliate.|`|1f5bd1801fd517e30868fcf2fe264afaaa	i feel you...i have two girls and two boys and i go through stuff like this with the younger two...but never the "twister"!!! :-)  But instead of the lower level, maybe let her do a twister on him...or better yet, you do one on him since it is really the job of the parent to reprimand.  I have hit my children how they have hit their sibling just so they know how it feels...if your daughter does it, then he will just see it as sibling rivalry and maybe say, "Oh, that didn't hurt!"  Maybe I'm wrong about encouraging this, but I'm just that kind of mom...it's not abuse, it's a taste of his own medicine.|`|vEv2YwWdaa	Both of your children are acting incredibly inappropriate.  You (and your husband, hopefully is is a two parents household) need to sit down with your son and tell him that what he is doing is wrong.  He can NOT touch his sister or any other female on their chest.  <br>  <br>  Your daughter wanting to kick him there is simlpy put strange.  You telling her you would think about it is appuling.  You should have said absouluty not, first we do not hurt others and we do not touch people ( in with out feet) in private areas.<br>  <br>  I am sure you will say he would never do it to anyone else but what are you going to do when he does that to a girl at school and he is charged with sexual assault.  This is serious.  You need to take charge.  Your child is acting out in a totally inappropriate way.  You better pray to God they have not told anyone else they do this.  No parent will let their child around your son.    <br>  <br>  A rule of thumb is "if DSS would investigate you" if they knew of this.  You should work to stop it!
dR4QN0gHaa	I am going to get a lot of thumbs down but here goes......Every time he gives her a titty twister, I think YOU should pop him upside the head. It hurts and it is extremely inappropriate.  Kicking him in the privates is only going to make things worse between them and he will retaliate. Not to mention that it could cause damage for him.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	I think that's between them, she's big enough she can get him - and purple nurples hurt boys too.   As for what he's doing, as soon as he starts puberty he's going to feel very bad about it.|`|QveBSjFSaa	Keep them from rough-housing and everyone's a winner.|`|9ZTYDMNPaa	I wouldn't actually tell her no but I wouldn't encourage either.  Just tell her it's between them and you will stay out of it.  Someone else suggested let the father speak with him, that may help abit if not he better be wearing a baseball cup because sis won't hesitate.|`|s4aX6bF6aa	i think taking privileges away is a fine thing...i would not encourage your daughter to do something back to him...that would just result in further rough house that would become too rough...keep talking to your son...sooner or later he will outgrow this need to gve titty twisters...i know you're hoping sooner rather than later...good luck.|`|e3fa2fb97cbca43e2c3086607351d4caaa	I'll tell her to go for it!|`|qieTdigdaa	I don't think its a good idea.  I see your point and I understand what you are trying to do, but if she hits him even a little too hard, it could cause serious damage to his testicles.  <br>  <br>  I know you've tried everything, and maybe having a male explain it to him - a dad, grandpa, uncle - someone who can explain it a little better suited to him.  Good luck.|`|AA10484853	When I was that age I would kick my brother in the nuts (and I thought it was funny) when he would pick on me to get him to leave me alone. He finally just hit me in the chest and it hurt so bad I didn't do it to him again. We called a truce at that point on the disrespect.|`|RLtzqQB9aa	you asked this like yesterday|`|hcH1AQ8faa	kick your son in the balls himself|`|RHX1yFb5aa	I say let her do it. Obviously your tactics aren't working so if she does it maybe he will learn a lesson. If I were your daughter though, I would not have asked for your permission to do it, I would just go for it!  <br>  <br>  My brother is much younger than me (15 yrs) and he is special needs so mentally he is around 6 but when he gets mad he hits and kicks with the strength of a normal 12 year old.  The last time he hit me in my stomach (I am pregnant) I punched him in the chest as hard as I could. I felt bad for doing it, but guess what...It taught him a lesson and he has not hit me in over six months.  He still hits my mom when he gets mad, but he doesn't hit "sissie" anymore.  Once your son realizes how it feels he should stop.  If not, let her do it every time he titty twists her and eventually he will stop!
2irmTjQ3aa	They all sound like possible pregnancy symptoms! If you miss your period take a pregnancy test to be sure. <br>  Good Luck!|`|qCe9Pnlgaa	If you have missed your period, leave now, and go get a test!!!! Why wait?

XYBHM8aSaa	For my 1st labor my Dr. cut it.  I didn't feel a thing.  Personally I think that was better.<br>  <br>  For my 2nd labor I tore and it hurt sooooo badly.  It was horrible, now I have a scar there and it hurts during sex.|`|9hrJfhIIaa	No, the vagina widens/expands. What you're thinking about is an episiotomy. The doc will cut your perineum and stitch it up after birth - but don't worry, you won't feel it because everything is stretched out.|`|b7ff0c6859d6ba5cc891050de578e39daa	No, that's not true.  Sometimes there is tearing and stitches, but that is the easiest part of delivery.  Work on reducing your stress and imagine an easy deliver.  The more relaxed you are the easier it will be.  If you constantly worry about what will go wrong, you will have a much harder time.|`|98WKYtfwaa	It doesn't burst, it might tear although you won't feel this happening because the amount of pressure down there, it'll probably just feel like a burning/nipping sensation.<br>  <br>  A doctor might perform an episiotomy which is when they slice your perenium (sp?) with a scalpol to prevent you tearing badly as a jagged tear is harder to stitch up than a straight tear. Most doctors are stopping this now as it takes longer to recover this way.<br>  <br>  If you need stitches, they usually give you an injection to numb the area, this just feels like a tiny nip and they get to work. If you've had an epidural then you don't need the numbing injection.<br>  <br>  You won't be that bothered about it, you'll have your baby in your arms and you'll be so overwhelmed by it all that you'll not notice it happening, sometimes they'll ask you to take some gas and air to prevent you feeling the nip of the numbing injection.<br>  <br>  Don't be scared.|`|peQGGFPYaa	No it does not burst. You may need an episiotomy and that is when the dr cuts a small part of your vagina so the baby can get all the way through and not tear you. and yes if an episiotomy is done or you tear you will get stitches down there.|`|Ihfq3Ih5aa	My vagina certainly did not 'burst', but it did tear extensively.<br>  <br>  Trust me, while your pushing, tearing is the last thing on your mind!|`|3fMK5moxaa	I wouldn't use the word burst.<br>  But mine nearly ripped though to my but they call it a third degree tear, im not sure if there's such thing as a forth but i heard you can rip all the way, and it does feel like your bursting you can also tear the wall of your vagina.<br>  But don't worry i was stitched up nicely and every things fine down there now.|`|bcM7Lxpeaa	bursts?? no you might tear a little and they will stich you up its not a big deal but with tearing there is more recovery i tore in two places with my first and didnt tear at all with my second one
2irmTjQ3aa	Take another pregnancy test, or go to the doctor's and get a blood test. Don't take your b.c. pills until you know for sure.<br>  Good Luck!|`|MPX0f5jzaa	I guess it depends on whether you plan to keep it.  I'm guessing maybe not since you were on birth control in the first place?|`|AA10624857	Regular use of birth control pills while unknowingly pregnant has no link to birth defects or abnormalities.  It is not uncommon for periods to be different when you switch birth control methods.  Since you had some bleeding plus a pregnancy test came back negative it is not likely you are pregnant.  However, it wouldn't be impossible either.  You should check with your doctor for a professional opinion, but I suggest you continue to take your pills as directed and see what happens with your next period.  In my own personal case, I conceived very unexpectedly when I was reliably taking birth control pills for 11 years.  I had no idea I was pregnant and for me, the hormones in the pills caused me to have what seemed like normal periods.  I didn't find out I was pregnant until I was at my doctor's for my regular yearly physical.  She discovered the pregnancy during my internal exam.  Since I was having what seemed like normal periods, I had to have an ultrasound to determine gestation.  We were all shocked to find out I was 17 weeks pregnant.  I had taken a birth control pill every day of that pregnancy up until the day I found out I was pregnant.  I was panicked at the thought of what I had done to my baby, but my doctor assured me that the baby would not be affected by the pills.  She did, however, say that the recommendation is not to take any unnecessary medicaton while pregnant and since the pill was obviously not needed I should stop taking them.  After I stopped then I didn't have any further episodes of period-like bleeding.|`|7b2ddd2f8ffad9c0b9a57aea08694331aa	Birth control pills don't hurt the baby. Most women find out early enough to stop. I mean you obviously wouldn't take them throughout the pregnancy, but there's no harm is continuing them if you are sexually active until you know for sure. <br>  <br>  Take another test in a week or so.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|c8e5d630616fd991d57af8eb76b7b3fbaa	I doubt that you are pregnant.  Your period is probably light because of the switch in bc, I would continue to take the pills.|`|LUbW8kTBaa	It's best to contact your gynecologist.  He/She will tell you what you should do.  As good of advice as people give on this site, I'd rather be following my doctor's orders!|`|qCe9Pnlgaa	Go to the doc asap and get a blood test. It will be more sensitive and pick up a pregnancy if you are pregnant. Don't take the pill until you know, and don't have sex unless you want a baby until you can take birth control or use a condom. :)|`|deScN1zXaa	I'm sorry i do not know, but if i were you i'd play it safe and ring the doctors or the NHS, and just not have sex or take the pill until you've seen them, better safe then sorry.
sRy2SKpXaa	It's very possible that it was a false negative test. When I first took a test for this pregnancy, it was negative. So I waited another week until my period was missed and sure enough it was positive, and i'm going to be 33 weeks tomorrow. I'd say wait until your missed period (if there is one) and test again, you're more likely to get accurate results then. Good luck.|`|do8pdlluaa	I found out I was pregnant at only 2 weeks with a blood test. A blood test is the only sure way to know so early.<br>  <br>  Also, ask your family about their pregnancies and the history of any problems. It's very important.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1178393/family_history_can_be_a_guide_to_your.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a>|`|qCe9Pnlgaa	Urine tests don't usually pick the up the pregnancy hormone until the day of the expected period. If you were pregnant, only a blood test would have caught it. :)|`|2jrffIoWaa	it could be too early.  just relax and take a home pregnancy test in about a week.  good luck!!!|`|LKIhUMCgaa	urine tests are 50/50 chance when it comes to negative results. it could be either too early or ur hcg level might be too low to be detected by a urine test.|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	it could be too Early. wait another few days and see if your period comes or not. if it doesn't test again :)

Personally prefer Camilla to Camille. <br>  Kiera Raine- 9/10 oh this is adorable Kiera is a great name and Raine wow prefect if she is born on a rainy day! Great great choice<br>  Kaelen Ryder - 6/10 a little masculine <br>  Lyra Mae - 9/10 this is again really nice name with Raine it would be 10/10 very unique but not too unusual so sweet. <br>  Aline Maxi - 4/10 not to keen that's the same for Elanena Jolie. <br>  Boys... <br>  Keeghan James - 7/10 like this name a lot prefer spelling Keegan however either spelling is nice love the name James with a passion <br>  Lisle - 2/10 unsure about how to say it <br>  Wyatt - 6/10 oh cool Wyatt James is a wow name not as good as Keegan/Keeghan. <br>  Suggestions:- <br>  girls... <br>  Abella meaning breath - french name <br>  Ailie origination's from France but is seen as Gaelic too<br>  Cathleen an Irish name meaning pure <br>  Allison meaning honest and noble an Irish name <br>  Boys... <br>  Aimon meaning rich protector an Irish name <br>  Cace meaning  vigorous an Irish name <br>  Albaric meaning blond ruler a French name <br>  Geoffrey a french name meaning devine peace<br>  Hope this helped!|`|cErLq7f3aa	Jolie Camille<br>  Keira Raine<br>  Lyra Mae<br>  Kristen Jolie<br>  <br>  Keegan James|`|hLWy1evQaa	Jolie sounds like you're naming her after Angelina Jolie. I know it's a french girls name, but beware. <br>  Camille is very pretty. <br>  Kiera Raine sounds kind of like a porn star name. <br>  Kaelen Ryder is pretty and unusual. But again, kind of in line with movie star worship (i.e. Winona Ryder)<br>  Lyra reminds me of licra, by Mae is pretty.<br>  Aline is pretty, but Maxi reminds me of Maxi-pads. <br>  Elaena ( pronounced ah-lain-ah??) is also pretty. <br>  <br>  Keeghan is an interesting name, but unless you're actually Irish, may cost him some pride because kids can be cruel. Same with Lisle. <br>  Wyatt is a very nice boy name. <br>  <br>  Boy Irish suggestions:<br>  Aidan         Dylan<br>  Colin          Andrew<br>  Colm         Cormac<br>  emmet       Finn<br>  <br>  Girl:<br>  Alanna    Brianna<br>  Briget     Claire<br>  Caera (keer-ra)<br>  Fiona<br>  Muireann (Meer-ran)<br>  <br>  French Boy<br>  Beau<br>  Louis (Lou-ee)<br>  Jean (John)<br>  Jamie<br>  Maurice<br>  Mason<br>  Marshall<br>  <br>  French Girl<br>  Denise<br>  Michelle<br>  Sophie<br>  Adele<br>  Dominique<br>  <br>  There's plenty of sites out there to google each though.

scdOdaTKaa	You can test early, HOWEVER< realize that the result if negative may not be accurate so are you really helping yourself by testing early. My advice is try to wait until the date of your period, if it doesn't show then test. That is proven to be more accurate. GOod luck and lots of baby dust!|`|2irmTjQ3aa	You can go ahead and test early, you might get accurate results. But if you test negative you need to take another test after your missed period to make sure!<br>  Good Luck!|`|WnlzScIyaa	I'm in the same situation, AF is due Thusday, but I have been having cramping in my overies, and constipation. I also believe I experienced implanation bleeding last Thursday, it lasted two days, and was light pink.

It is best to test in the morning, but I am going to try to hold my pee for at least 4 hours and not drink anything and test this evening! I will let you know if I get my BFP. I think you should do the same, and let me know!<br>  Good luck!|`|JDJRRcJsaa	As you already have the test you will struggle all week not to use it, you could always test first thing in the morning and if its negative then buy another test and test again when your period is due, im the same, i have cramping and tender boobs and my af is due on friday to! Im scared to test though cos i dont want it to be negative! Good luck and lots of baby dust x x|`|9CbMqw9haa	test early b4 u drive urself mad
JOVWBOOCaa	This makes the situation more difficult and in the end, it is your child. This child will forever be some part of him and although you feel there was not much good out of your husband, he did help to create your son! My daughter is 4 now and her father was also EXTREMELY abusive! I lost one baby and got pregnant one year to the day with my daughter. The day I found out, I left him to protect myself and my unborn baby. I did give her his last name and I don't for a second regret it. She is part of her father as well, I would never and will never talk bad about her father. She will figure it out herself as he calls maybe 4 times a year. She does ask about him though, quite often! I have made her aware of who he is and I reassure her that he loves her. (which he does love her, just immature) Just as this man, regardless of how he treated you would have loved his child and obviously his family does too. There comes a time when we have to let go of our pain and suffering, our anger and resentment and look at the fact that we cared about this man enough to have a baby with him. Our child will forever be half of that man so apart of you will have no choice but to love that man until the day you die in some way or another. If you feel angry or resent him forever your child will pick up on that and it will make him feel that you love him less. His dad is dead which makes it even harder. He will never have to find out the things the two of you went through and do you really want him to? He is already missing out on so much. It is up to you and nobody has the right to tell you what to do or what to name your child but it is something to think long and hard about. He will wonder about his daddy, he will have so many questions, there are days it will break your heart and you will want to yell about what an SOB he was but you will have to look your son in the eye (seeing his father) and tell him the good things. Thinking about the reasons you married him not why you reluctantly stayed married. Explain to him how much his daddy would have loved him. You do not have to lie to your child but some things are better left unsaid. Give him another person to look up to and don't pass on the anger. I love the name you picked out and I would explain to his family that this is the name you have picked and with good reason. You may want to consider giving him his fathers last name though. What if you get remarried some day and then you don't have the same last name anyway. It would be a way of keeping the family name going for his family. Kind of meet in the middle. It will be up to you and whatever you decide will be right for you and I am sure that you will make it work. You are left in a tough situation. Trust me I know, my mom wanted me to use her family's last name, my dad his family's, and of course my daughter's father expected his. There is no right or wrong I suppose but it is so dang hard under the circumstances! LOL Good luck and I am sorry for your loss, especially for your son!|`|AA10976444	Tell them the truth, then don'w worry about it.

They should be thankful that you even decide to give this baby their last name, because you could give it your maiden name  and only list him as the father. If they don't like your decision then that's their problem. This is their issue not yours. They'll have to decide at that point if they're going to be in this child's life or not. Let them deal with your decision however they decide. Obviously you didn't need them before and you don't need them or their input now. This is your baby and your life, do what you want to do. If you let them influence you now, then they'll try to keep influencing you throughout this baby's whole life if they decide to stay around. Good Luck!!!!!!!!!|`|gUIhXGNeaa	Don't give him his fathers last name. I did that and it was a huge mistake.

I would tell them exactly as you said it above.  They must know he was abusive.  If you don't want to deal with a straight answer, you could tell them that you don't agree with naming kids the same as their fathers because you want him to have his 'own identity'.|`|698b3b0b5ebf7083a923b4bde2eb3921aa	Just tell them the truth.

It's your child, he was irresponsible. You dont even have him around anymore anyways, so who cares what anybody thinks or wants to do. YOU DO WHAT YOU FEEL is the right  thing to do. I just have a suggestion:  don't give him no one else's name make it special, make it his own! and thats what you tell him when he grows up.  Make one up :  mix two names to make a new name.  a special one NO ONE EVER has! like Rhianna's name: I had never hear this name before. I'm sure you will make one up. Not confine him to a BAD memory for the rest of his life.

Anyways, I think that you should either tell your teacher about her or somehow get her to notice it. As said above, you could leave an anonymous note or get your teacher to look in your direction more often.<br>  <br>  As far as the anonymous letter, if you really don't want her to know who it is then I would type it up and I wouldn't say 'my friend' anywhere in the note. If you don't really care about the teacher knowing who it is, then go ahead and write it however you want. I have been in this situation many times and by telling an adult about it, that person got the help that they needed and is doing much better today. <br>  <br>  If you want to get the teacher to look in your direction, the raising of the hand asking a question is a good way. Or if you don't really care about her knowing that you want her to see your friend, then just tell her to keep an eye out or make some kind of signal with her so she'll look over there. <br>  <br>  You could also go to the school counselor for help, they're trained to help with those kinds of issues. The anonymous letter thing would be quite easy and your friend would still get the help that she needs. Best of luck and I hope that your friend is okay.|`|SWemIRRjaa	no, i reckon telling a teacher is probably quite a bad move, i reckon that its up to the girl.

I have only found out today that my friend self harms, it was a big shock. If you tell a teacher when the girl really didn't want you to, she might feel like she is backed up in a corner.

He loves me and cries with me; for my heart has been broken. I so wanted to be your little girl. I don't quite understand what has happened. I was so excited when I began realizing my existance. I was in a dark, yet comfortable place. I saw I had fingers and toes. I was pretty far along in my developing, yet not near ready to leave my surroundings. I spent most of my time thinking or sleeping. Even from my earliest days, I felt a special bonding between you and me. Sometimes I heard you crying and I cried with you. Sometimes you would yell or scream, then cry. I heard Daddy yelling back. I was sad, and hoped you would be better soon. I wondered why you cried so much. One day you cried almost all of the day. I hurt for you. I couldn't imagine why you were so unhappy. That same day, the most horrible thing happened. A very mean monster came into that warm, comfortable place I was in. I was so scared, I began screaming, but you never once tried to help me. Maybe you never heard me. The monster got closer and closer as I was screaming and screaming, "Mommy, Mommy, help me please; Mommy, help me." Complete terror is all I felt. I screamed and screamed until I thought I couldn't anymore. Then the monster started ripping my arms off. It hurt so bad; the pain I can never explain. It didn't stop. Oh, how I begged it to stop. I screamed in horror as it ripped my leg off. Though I was in such complete pain, I was dying. I knew I would never see your face or hear you say how much you love me. I wanted to make all your tears go away. I had so many plans to make you happy. Now I couldn't; all my dreams were shattered. Though I was in utter pain and horror, I felt the pain of my heart breaking, above all. I wanted more than anything to be your daughter. No use now, for I was dying a painful death. I could only imagine the terrible things that they had done to you. I wanted to tell you that I love you before I was gone, but I didn't know the words you could understand. And soon, I no longer had the breath to say them; I was dead.I felt myself rising. I was being carried by a huge angel into a big beautiful place. I was still crying, but the physical pain was gone. The angel took me to Jesus and set me on His lap. He said He loved me, and He was my Father. Then I was happy. I asked Him what the thing was that killed me. He answered, "Abortion. I am sorry, my child; for I know how it feels." I don't know what abortion is; I guess that's the name of the monster. I'm writing to say that I love you and to tell you how much I wanted to be your little girl. I tried very hard to live. I wanted to live. I had the will, but I couldn't; the monster was too powerful. It sucked my arms and legs off and finally got all of me. It was impossible to live. I just wanted you to know I tried to stay with you. I didn't want to die. Also, Mommy, please watch out for that abortion monster. Mommy, I love you and I would hate for you to go through the kind of pain I did. Please be careful.<br>  <br>  Love,<br>  Your Baby Girl|`|HAueVh8Naa	i had one when i was young and regret it everyday and its been 5 years .but i was stupid back then and didnt really think about it but if people actally talked to me about my options i would of given baby up for adoption because every baby deserves to see the world .|`|Q8fcepcZaa	i think up until the stage where the baby can be aware of what's happening to it, there isn't a problem. up until that point it is no different to wearing a condom to prevent a baby. i have a thumbs down already but i wish i knew on what grounds.|`|9hrJfhIIaa	Why? You can't form your own opinion on the subject? This is not the place to post stuff like this...|`|ul79DG2kaa	To 7 mos prego with a baby boy.  First I want to congratulate you on your pregnancy.  2nd I think you are a horrible person for posting that filth.  You think that there is never a reason to have an abortion, have you ever had to make that hard choice?  What if having a baby were to kill you?  What about an abused little girl who has already been through a terrible ordeal.  Should she have to go through carrying and giving birth to a child?  I knew a girl who was being abused by her own father.  She was a quiet, lovely girl.  She was 12 when social services took her away.  I was never able to keep in touch, we had been best friends.  As a young girl I didn't know what was happening to her, but as I grew older I understood some of the things she said, she shouldn't have known.  I knew her since we were 6, I think it started before we met.  If she had become pregnant should she have suffered through giving birth to her father's child after being raped by him?  How would that have helped her?<br>  <br>  I don't believe in abortion as a form of birth control.  I believe you should be responsible for your own reproduction.  If I was forced into sex I don't know what I would do, but I wouldn't want someone telling me I was wrong for making the best decision for me.  No matter what that decision was.|`|2srWJtjPaa	I mean no one likes abortions. But sometimes the situation your in you kind of have no choice. I feel if you do it it should only be once and It better be worth it. I had 1 before and felt bad but at the end of the day I was not finally stable and if I have a child I want my baby to have the world and not struggle.Its something that will never ever forget if you get it done. And sometimes you might just cry 4 no reason. So just make the right choice|`|WljG2gXsaa	if yur thinking about it. DONT DO IT. trust me yur gona regret it forever. yu dont know what you have til its gone and once yu have an abortion theres no turning back. I am 1 million percent against abortion. my mom pressured me and brainwashed me into having one after she knew how i felt about them. I dont agree with them and I think they should be illegal. just remember that baby is a part of yu. dont do anything stupid please|`|nxHztcslaa	i hate it.. totally agaisnt it, would never consider it... i think its wrong to kill and its murder... HOWEVER it should be legal.. people are always going to do this no matter what i think and i think it should be done in a safe way, not down some alley..|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	Stop posting these effin abortion questions! Were pregnant and its a very happy time. We don't need you in here, wanting to know all about killing unborn babies. So piss off!|`|g7wQij2Oaa	I am totally against it.<br>  Yes it offends me.<br>  No i do not prefer it.<br>  No it is not worth it.<br>  No i have never had one.<br>  and i would never.. no matter what the situation was.<br>  Youre Welcome.<br>  <br>  :)|`|8to6MsWuaa	Well, i personally wouldn't, but i think there are certain circumstances, like a rape victim, where someone would want one. If i ever got one i would probably would regret it.|`|a67f223481e1f00da8ea5d7d5f8d576caa	Well, offend me?  I don't think that is the word.  Devastates and breaks my heart more likely.  I was unable to conceive until receiving medical assistance but babies are precious.  I know so many women who want them and their bodies don't allow it.  I know many women as well who had abortions and never, ever got over what they did.  So many people think the baby is a blob of tissue.  But around the time you know you are pregnant the heart begins to beat.  It is alive or it would not grow.  I found out I was pregnant at 9 weeks and my precious little baby already had arms and legs with hands and feet with fingers and toes.  The eyes are in place and everything.  Baby is moving but you cannot feel it.  Your body is nourishing this life within you.  If you are having a girl you very soon are carrying the person who will later provide you with grandchildren and what is so odd to realize is that the ovaries and eggs that will produce YOUR GRANDCHILDREN are IN YOUR WOMB.  <br>  <br>  I have and never would have an abortion.  I will tell you this, it affects the mother AND the father.  My husband dated a woman before he met me and she became pregnant.  (This gal was super fertile... he was an idiot for going there.)  She told him and asked what he wanted to do.  He hardly knew her and did not want a kid with her.  He took her to the clinic where she underwent the "procedure" also know as allowing an abortionist to tear your child from life and your womb.  As soon as she walked out after the "treatment" he knew they had made a grave error and never has gotten over it.  In fact I think he said he felt responsible for my infertility as he felt it was a result of his choice.  As much as I am glad they don't share a child together this is not how I would have wanted it to happen.  He will carry it forever.<br>  <br>  So no, I would say it is NOT worth it.  He does not think so.  His heart is broken and he wonders if it were a son or daughter.  Now we are miraculously pregnant with his third living daughter (since we are not sure if the baby that was killed was a girl or boy) and he cherishes this and is so grateful.<br>  <br>  If you are pregnant and considering your options I ask you this... please look into baby development and make a decision that is fully informed.  When a baby's life is ended it is so sad.  When someone is misled to thinking it is not a living being yet and would not kill a living being but does so because of lies... well that is just not okay.  Women have given birth to babies they were told were blobs of tissue to have this tiny, living baby somehow survive and even cry while the abortionist sometimes throws this living baby away.  They are obligated by law to try and save this little human being.  Some don't.<br>  <br>  Be aware.|`|HEXHdNKLaa	I find abortion to be an abomination. That baby is ALIVE and a PERSON. it already has its own dna, and noone has the right to take its life.<br>  i have never had an abortion, but i have talked to plenty of women who have, and they HATE themselves for it. it is thier number one regret in life. every single one of them. i have never met a woman who had an abortion who thinks she did the right thing or thinks it was worth it.|`|WEeWYNroaa	I think that abortion is awful. To me its a legal form of murder. I think that if you think your old enough to have sex then your old enough to have a child. Its an obvious consequence. The only time I think it should be an option is in the case of rape. Because you did not chose to lay down for that.|`|uZ8mIhJ1aa	I had an abortion at 16 and I have never regreted it wouldn't of been fair on the baby and to put it up for adoption....isn't there enough children in the world that need a family.

But hey we do things we know are wrong all the time. Like having sex before were married. Sin is sin in God's eyes.But if you feel you have no othere option, do as you feel.

No matter what they tell you.|`|k8jCIfLTaa	i dont ever think abortions are exceptable..i think it's wrong to have an abortion...killin an innocent baby is rediculous no matter how old you are if you wasnt ready for the chances of ahving a baby you shouldnt be spreading your legs...i just turned 18 and i think im pregnant i wasnt really ready for a bbaby but i have to own up to my responsiblilities..so ABORTIONS IS A NO!!!!|`|HSa041M0aa	Late term abortions should be banned!  Anything within the first six weeks is OK with me.  I have never had an abortion...  An ex girlfriend who was at least eight months pregnant left the state and headed to the West Coast--she came back not pregnant.  She had a late term abortion and I could no longer stomach her presence....our friendship was based on our kids--they met at the library--we did not live in the same neighborhood--my son was friends with her son, the Mom was an addict and alcoholic --the grandmother now has custody of both her kids...why did she wait until the eighth month..only God knows.  (Still sickens me when I think about it--PLEASE practice safe sex, NOT ONE DRINK when pregnant --no smoking or illegal drug use!)|`|azE51WGRaa	Why would you ask a bunch of pregnant or trying to conceive women what they think about abortion???

gyYXV3Bxaa	Milk is easier to get from the bottle than the breast.  Is breastfeeding something you want to continue for awhile?  If so, I would stop offering her the bottle.  Try putting her to your breast as often as necessary.  Try skin-to-skin contact.  If your baby ABSOLUTELY will not breastfeed, then offer her the milk in a bottle.  But don't give up without a fight!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Help -- My Baby Won't Nurse! <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/baby/back-to-breast.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/baby...</a><br>  Introduction<br>  <br>  The following techniques have proven helpful for a wide range of problems with baby refusing the breast. Some of the babies who might benefit include:<br>  <br>      * a newborn (or older adopted baby) trying to figure out how to breastfeed<br>      * a previously-weaned baby whom you wish to breastfeed again<br>      * a baby who seriously resists nursing (or even being placed in a nursing position)<br>      * a baby with nipple confusion<br>      * a baby who is a fussy nurser (but does not completely refuse the breast)<br>      * a baby on a nursing strike<br>  <br>  Even if you have a baby who adamantly resists nursing, getting your baby to breast is very possible but it will probably require time, patience, and kangaroo-style frequency. Expect "two steps forward and one step backward."<br>  <br>  If you're getting discouraged working with your non-nursing baby, read this: My Baby Just Doesn't Get It. If you have a newborn who is not latching on, do keep in mind that almost all reluctant nursers will start latching by four to eight weeks of life. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ============<br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org//NB/NBMarApr99p43.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org//NB/NBMarApr99p43.ht...</a><br>  I leave my babies infrequently, but when Walden was six months old, I needed to leave her for two hours with my husband. I left plenty of pumped milk and lots of instructions for Walter. Among his many options for feeding the baby, he chose to use the bottle. She took to it well and fell asleep in his arms. I nursed her immediately after I walked in the door and she latched on fine.<br>  <br>  The next day was a different story. She was fussy at the breast for most of the day and in the evening she bit me. The day after that was even worse. She bit me so hard that I yelled, and that triggered a six-hour nursing strike. I was scared to nurse her again for fear of being bitten, and she refused to latch on. Finally, she became sleepy and we nursed lying down in a dark room.<br>  <br>  At one point, while I was carrying her around in an attempt to calm her, we walked past the drying rack in the kitchen, and she reached out for the bottle! I felt awful! That was the clue that made my co-Leader suggest that the bottle triggered the nursing strike. I had thought she was too old to have trouble switching between bottle and breast, especially since she seemed to nurse well just after she had the bottle.<br>  <br>  Then I remembered that my older daughter also had problems with artificial nipples. When Meridian was 14 months old, I was providing childcare for other young children and they used bottles. One day, Meridian decided that she needed one, too. I gave her one filled with water. For the next week nursing was very uncomfortable for me, and she left teeth imprints on my breast, which she had never done before. Things did improve, and after that I avoided giving her bottles even to play with.<br>  <br>  We say babies have "nipple confusion" if they have difficulty breastfeeding after using artificial nipples, whether bottles or pacifiers/dummies. The term is usually associated with newborn babies, and some authorities disagree about how significant it is. Whatever the label, it makes sense that an older baby might struggle, too. He can bite on an artificial nipple (or on a cup with a spout) with no consequences. Sometimes, a mother may even be unaware that her baby is biting these inanimate objects. But she can't fail to notice when he does the same thing at the breast.<br>  <br>  =========<br>  <a href="http://www.breastfeed-essentials.com/nursingstrike.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.breastfeed-essentials.com/nur...</a><br>  A nursing strike usually lasts just a few days but may persist for a week or two. Even though a lot of mothers do choose to wean during a strike, most babies can be coaxed back to the breast with some patience and determination. It may take some detective work to find the cause. All of the following are known to occasionally result in a strike: teething, illness, sores in the baby's mouth, a change in the taste of the milk, apprehension as a result of the mother's reaction to being bitten, prolonged separation between mother and baby, the frequent use of bottles or the pacifier, low milk supply, etc. Some lactation experts believe that a nursing strike can many times precede the baby's mastery of a developmental skill such as crawling, standing, or walking. And sometimes the cause is never known.<br>  <br>  Following are some suggestions that you may find helpful in persuading your reluctant nurser back to the breast:<br>  <br>      * Before attempting to feed at all, pump a few minutes. This will elicit letdown so that the baby gets a quick reward. It will also elongate the nipple for him.<br>  <br>      * Also before feeding, offer him your index or pinky finger nail-side down to suck on for several minutes. This suck-training teaches him to drop his tongue down as he must do with breastfeeding. This is also a good way to calm the baby should he become upset as you offer your breast.<br>  <br>      * Breastfeed frequently - as often as you can. Attempt to feed before the baby gets too hungry - when he is sucking on his fingers or rooting, but before he cries. If you can catch him early he may be more willing to work with you.<br>  <br>      * You also might try nursing when he is a little drowsy. Some babies are more willing to take the breast when they are semi-asleep than when fully awake. Try nursing as he is beginning to get sleepy or just beginning to wake up. Some mothers find that their babies will instinctively nurse well once completely asleep.<br>  <br>      * Try different nursing positions. Nursing while lying down often helps minimize any distractions that may interfere with nursing. Nursing in a quiet, dark room may also be helpful.<br>  <br>      * Nurse while in motion - as you walk, sway, rock, bounce, etc.<br>  <br>      * Provide lots of skin-to-skin contact when nursing and at other times as you can. Undress baby to his diaper and remove your blouse if possible. Try nursing while you both enjoy a warm bath.<br>  <br>      * Drip expressed breastmilk over your nipple in the corner of the baby's mouth using an eyedropper or feeding syringe while he is at the breast.<br>  <br>      * If the strike persists for more than a few days, the baby may be more willing to nurse at the breast if the flow of milk is instant and constant. A nursing supplementer can help you achieve this.<br>  <br>      * If baby becomes upset as you are trying, stop and attempt to calm him before trying again. Nursing should not become associated with unpleasantness.<br>  <br>  ==========<br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org/NB/NBNovDec92p173.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org/NB/NBNovDec92p173.ht...</a><br>  Possible Causes of a Nursing Strike<br>  <br>  Sometimes the cause of a nursing strike is obvious, but other times the mother may never discover the reason. Some common causes for a baby to refuse to nurse include:<br>  <br>      * mouth pain from teething, an injury, a cold sore, or a fungus infection, such as thrush,<br>      * an ear infection, which may cause pressure or pain while nursing,<br>      * pain while being held in the nursing position, perhaps due to an immunization or an injury,<br>      * a cold or stuffy nose that makes breathing difficult while nursing,<br>      * too many bottles, overuse of a pacifier, or frequent thumbsucking, which >may lead to a reduced milk supply,<br>      * regular distractions and interruptions while nursing,<br>      * an unusually long separation from mother. <br>  <br>  There may be situations or actions on the mother's part that contribute to a baby's refusal to nurse:<br>  <br>      * a strong reaction to a baby's bite,<br>      * a major change in routine, such as moving or traveling,<br>      * limiting and/or rigidly scheduling feedings,<br>      * talking in a loud voice or arguing with other family members while nursing,<br>      * overstimulation, stress, or tension from an overly full schedule or an upset in the home,<br>      * repeatedly putting off the baby when she wants to nurse or letting her cry. <br>  <br>  Becki Hallowell from Guam discovered on the third day of six-month-old Todd's nursing strike that "we had all the usual causes and then some. We all had bad colds. (Todd's was the worst.) We were all very tired and in a new situation with extra stresses. Todd's grandparents, whom we hadn't seen in a year, were visiting us for a month. During their visit, Grandpa ended up in the hospital. Todd had been biting me due to teething, and I had reacted strongly."<br>  <br>  Other, less common causes of a nursing strike include sensitivity to a food or drug the mother or baby has ingested (including vitamin or mineral supplements, fluoride drops, dairy products, or caffeine), creams or ointments applied to the mother's nipples, change in the taste of the mother's milk due to a breast infection or change in mother's diet, or a reaction to a new product (such as a soap, shampoo, or laundry detergent) the mother has used on her body or clothing.<br>  <br>  Naturally, not all babies will respond to these situations by refusing to nurse. Some babies are more sensitive than others, and different babies will display a wide range of reactions to the same thing. For example, one baby with an ear infection might continue nursing well, while a second baby becomes fussy at the breast, and a third baby refuses the breast altogether.<br>  <br>  ===========<br>  <a href="http://www.drjaygordon.com/development/bf/striketips.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.drjaygordon.com/development/b...</a><br>  Things that can cause a strike:<br>  <br>      * A separation from mother that is longer than the child is typically accustomed to having between nursing sessions<br>      * An illness that is causing a stuffy nose, making it difficult to breath while nursing<br>      * An illness causing a sore mouth or throat<br>      * Nipple confusion caused by artificial nipples and/or pacifiers<br>      * Teething pain<br>      * Pain while in the nursing position, due to an ear infection or injury<br>      * Too many distractions in the nursing environment, such as other children, phone, etc. drawing the baby's attention away from nursing<br>      * A dramatic reaction to baby having bitten you whil|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	check for toothers!!  my 7.5 month son just did that, he has his first tooth coming in.  If i give him a teething ring out of the fridge, then nurse him he's fine.  the bottom middle come in first usually, but it could technically be any tooth.  feel for any unusual bumps, red spots, or a white spot that looks like it's being stretched. Mine has his bottom middle right coming in right now.|`|XSol0H6Uaa	I use to wish my baby would take to the bottle.   He never did.

K7XSAjOvaa	why are you trying to get pregnant or what?there are other ways to protect yourself from getting pregnant.God most give you the egg at the precise time.My wife and I had sex for over a year with no protection and one day walah!!God made it happen at the right time.Only God can create life so when you realize that you will have a better chance.Maybe your just not ready but don't be a fool when you do get pregnant don't abort it,the life given to you will be a blessing don't give it up.You never know if you will have another chance.God will give you a life when he is ready to make life believe it or not.I'm no God freak but all life is a gift from something way larger than man.Just think about how many different things have to be in order and at the exact time just to conceive,Then everything that takes place during the first 6 weeks it is amazing!!!! do some research and study the beauty of life before giving birth to it.Good luck and may God be with you!!!!!!|`|I3TWkMaqaa	if your really that worried i strongly advise for you to go to the doctor and get some fertility tests done. but its possible you just havnt had sex on your ovulation days, and ive heard that small window is your only oppertunity to become pregnant.<br>  <br>  hope i helped, and everything works out the way you want it to.|`|h5cFkP35aa	in my first marriage i tried like hell to get pregnant with no success for years. after my divorce i started dating my now boyfriend and got pregnant a month later. it could depend on the person or you may have a hormone deficiency, which is common and easily treated. just go to any ob/gyn clinic, explain the situation and ask for hormonal blood testing.<br>  <br>  dude, alice - pop a f-cking chill pill, damn.|`|ptTZMe0Oaa	maybe you r the kind of girl that will need to take pills to become pregnant|`|uKXgg9heaa	Get tested to see who's the problem.|`|wvPwc4PGaa	Doesn't always happen
YFPMcHCbaa	No one here will be able to tell you if you are pregnant. Almost all of the symptoms you get during pregnancy can be associated with something else.<br>  <br>  Take a test, go to the doctor or do some research. This type of question is asked a thousand times a day.
1thzSbS8aa	Yes, you can get pregnant from doing that. So don't let him do that.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	If any sperm got inside of you then it is a possibility.|`|jjUcYwG3aa	Yes u can get pregnant.

2674548b6a4c9cdbb098044c58c7af7aaa	No.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Nope. No fasting needed.|`|077a430c1a605554bc4be87a313735a9aa	The only blood test you have to fast for is the glucose test, and you only have to fast for 2 hours.|`|PfIywLLyaa	No you do not have to. They are measuring a hormone in your system and eating will not affect that outcome.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I ALWAYS need to fast before a blood test. (I don't know why) but never a pee test.
rDw9N09iaa	i had the same exact pain when i would walk. my doctor told me that i needed to drink more water and that my body was exausted and thats what causes the pain.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	How often are you getting these pains?|`|sR9XV5Z1aa	Its probably just your muscles, they are already stretched so when walking or excersizing you will feel them pull.|`|e5CZUPZMaa	i am 33 weeks too and just as you i have experienced frequent pains down the center of my stomach...but mine is usually when im sitting for more than a few minutes or after i sit and have bent over. from the responses i've gotten and information i've read they are braxton hicks contractions and for some they can be slightly painful...especially approaching due date. its best to not worry, but just mention it to your midwife. relax as much as you can with your feet elevated and wait for the big day to come. congratulations...---wonder who will go in first?|`|CFFuFof1aa	It's called Braxton Hicks Contractions. It's very normal, the further along you get the more often and harder they will be. It's just your bodies way of getting you ready for labor. Congrats. I would still go to your midwife and let her check to see if you had dilated or effaced at all.
67Lvls2zaa	No! The two functions can't happen at once. It's not likely, but some women experience vaginal bleeding. Bleeding may or may not be problematic. It's not abnormal for it to happen, but can cause complications. If this is you or someone you know, I would strongly advise seeing a GP. If you ovulate when you're pregnant, you'd lose the baby. If you're on the pill when you get pregnant, and this is where the misconception of being able to be on your period comes about, you might have bleeding episodes for a while.|`|9noaDDbcaa	I don't think so. Your period consists of blood built up to protect the sperm as it travels to the egg. When you don't get a sperm in there the wall breaks down and blood comes out. So, no. There is no physical ways to be pregnant and have a period.|`|c3WJMgA1aa	yes some women still have full-blown periods while being pregnant.<br>  Its not too common, but its possible.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	It's technically not a period, but it does happen sometimes.

You can go to the feed store and buy one of those water basins. Like they used to use for baths back in the old western days. That would be fun for him to play like he's a cowboy in the old west and take a bath like they used to do.|`|yZDyUfSNaa	I don't know of any toddler baths per say, maybe they exist -- I just don't know of any, but I think the Eurobath for babies is quite large and might fit a toddler (it says it's to 24 months). Otherwise, you could probably pick up one of those large plastic tubs that people use to put ice and soda in for parties and use it as a bath instead, or even a really large rubbermaid-type storage container would work, minus the lid of course. ;)

If she must have one for sleeping, wash it regularly.<br>  Wash bedding regularly.<br>  Clean the room thoroughly, especially carpet, and open the windows to let out stale air.<br>  Keep pets out of her room.<br>  Elevate the head end of her crib by placing a book or some magazines under the crib legs.<br>  Put a vaporizor in her room.  Make sure it's clean if it's an old one.<br>  No smoking around her - vehicle or house.<br>  Change your furnace filter.<br>  <br>  Most of the above ideas are just to keep her environment cleaner, in case that's the cause of her cough, and even if it's not, dust and things in the air can irritate colds too.<br>  <br>  Read about croup, which causes coughing fits at nighttime.  When my kids had croup, we kept the temps lower in the house, and even took them outside during an attack to get the inflammation to go down.  But, if she can't breath, swallow, or talk (as in, vocal cords not producing sound) while coughing, she needs to go to the e.r.<br>  <br>  Keep her active during the day, lots of exercise, running, etc.  Sometimes that clears out congestion too.  Even a good laugh makes a person cough up junk sometimes.|`|vEv2YwWdaa	See another doctor.  A ear nose and throat specialist.  Most doctors do not give cough syurp to a child so young.

She may have some sort of obstruction.|`|1f5bd1801fd517e30868fcf2fe264afaaa	she may have acid reflux...when you lay down you may get post nasal drip that goes into her throat or the acid from her stomach may come up.  this has happened with both my 6 year-old and myself...we're both lactose intolerant so I think that also plays a role in it...we were both given prescriptions...hope this helps.|`|DUjr9tNUaa	Go to the doctor.

79cN4rs6aa	You must live in France.

We only get a maxiuof 12 weeks off and thats WITHOUT pay for msot companies. Don't tell them, wait until you're showing.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	where do you live because i want to get a years paid maternity leave!|`|LFXTpqfdaa	What country do you live in? Who's paying your maternity leave?|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	I'm from ontario canada too (haha, don't you love our health care here ;) ) and this happens pretty often. As far as I know, you'll go back to work, even if it's only for a couple months. You'll then get maternity leave again for a year, but you won't get as much pay. The amount you are paid is based on how much money you made in the year before you got pregnant, so making less money = getting less money. It's usually about 75% of your normal wage for normal 40 hour weeks, so if you only worked 2.5 months for 40 hours a week then you would only get like, 18% your normal wage. <br>  <br>  (Yeah, just checked my manual), it has something to do with how many weeks your back at work, like 100% of your first two weeks and 90% of each 4 weeks after that? Does that sound right? That, divided up by the year, so you should be getting like 96% of what you would make in 6 weeks, divided up over a year. .. It was kind of confusing and it might vary by company as well. <br>  <br>  oh, and isn't Mat Leave only 50 weeks? Just wondering....(I could be wrong).. I know it's BASICALLY a year... many women here take their 2 weeks vacation at the beginning or end to make up to 52 full weeks off. <br>  <br>  I'm not entirely sure who you would talk to about that one, but I would start with HR at your work (or whoever handles that kind of thing)...

Perhaps inquire what they are willing to do.  Maybe suggest that you are willing to come back to work now or ask if they would would be willing to hold your position even without pay until after your second is born.|`|LUbW8kTBaa	I've never heard of any place giving a year's paid maternity leave.  That's great though if your employer does.  However, maybe you should go back to work now and save the rest of the year's paid leave for the next child.|`|rC6gL7KOaa	1 year of maternity leave? Wow! You must be from another country. In the US all we get is 12 weeks. You need to contact your employer to find out how that works.
yKE9lU00aa	Whatever you do don't make a scene on the plane with the child if the child cries, one woman got her kids taken from her because she spanked one and they accused her of that new "terrorist law" because she argued with a flight attendant for a brief second in a high enough voice, the flight attendant came to see why the child was crying, it wasn't even about child abuse, it was that stupid stupid terrorist law (check it out too) so she started aguing with the flight attendant and this horrible horrible  thing happened she even did jail time, look up the story you will find it.

QTfTVWmZaa	Totally normal everytime I was sick mine would seem to move less also around this time the baby is getting very cramped in there and instead of kicks I felt more rolls and adjustments I'll call them LOL the pain under your ribs is probably just the baby kicking your ribs mine does that all the time Ouch! To help with the heaviness you could try one of those belts from pregnant bellies they sell them at Babies R Us, I've never tried one though. Good Luck only a few weeks to go.|`|BHrKHNsoaa	at 35 weeks, it could just be the baby getting too big for the womb.  its also your body adjusting itself for you to actually go through labor.<br>  <br>  if you are really concerned, call your doctor. but it seems like ordinary aches and pains to me. :)

I7ktUFQfaa	I feel your pain, I also live in Canada and get killed with boredom in the winter months. Ok, 10 months old.. hmm. You could play with her in the snow.. make snow angels, snowmen, or just make a little fort. You could put her in daycare for maybe 4 hours a week so she would be occupied and you go out shopping / have a bit of free time. You could take her sleeding actually, if you get a taboggin ( sp ).. you could put her in the middle between you and your husband and go down little hills. You could take her to a movie, or to a mall or something.|`|I12nj0M7aa	Take up a hobby, learn an instrument, paint, learn to knit, learn to crochet, learn some cool recipes and cook, write a childrens novel.|`|AA11537580	sliding<br>  swimming at a pool<br>  join a mommy and me group<br>  play groups<br>  invite  a friend over  for coffee<br>  get a hobby<br>  bake<br>  do some finger painting with your son<br>  read with him<br>  sing with him|`|Kbz8XEf9aa	Why dont you go to some drop in moms programs, check at your local community centre and you will find very affordable things or free groups, where your babe can meet friends and you can talk to other moms.

I used to live in Canada, but live in a country with a warmer climate, and when I go home in the winter time, and as much as I love going home, I start feeling depressed.  I personally would start networking, check out your community centre and see what type of programs they have available for children your age, and through that you may meet some other moms in the same situation.  Perhaps you guys could start your own little play group.  It's kind of tough cause your child is very young and you cannot enjoy that many outdoor activities with him as of yet.  Why don't you try taking a mommy and me swim class that would be fun and perhaps remind you of back home a bit.  I am trying to think of stuff, cause you lived in Florida, where 98% of the time you probably did things outdoor.  A walk to the park or playground or go to the beach and play in the sand for hours, at least that is what I do with my kids, even in the winter months.  Yeah, I think I would start with networking you need to establish your social circle again, I think it will be so beneficial for you(I hope I am being coherent cause I am just writing exactly what I am thinking right now, I am literally putting myself in your shoes, knowing full well what your move means)  GOOD LUCK AND WHEN THE SPRING ROLLS AROUND THINGS WELL GET BETTER FOR YOU I PROMISE.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	art ..we do lots of beading and glueing..learn an instrument..bird watch ..make feeders<br>  cabin fever sets in for  months|`|AA11108018	Visit your local mall the library.

Yet studies suggest that mothers and infants intuitively sense each other's presence in bed.<br>  <br>  At the University of Notre Dame's Mother-Baby Behavioral Sleep Laboratory, our studies of breastfeeding mothers who sleep with their 2- to 4-month-olds reveal that both mothers and their babies are extremely sensitive throughout the night to each other's shifting position in the bed.<br>  <br>  During my many years of studying sleep-sharing, I've never heard of a single instance in which, under safe conditions, it was proven that a mother suffocated her child. Notice that I said safe conditions: Babies can and do accidentally suffocate when one or both parents doesn't know a baby is in the bed, is drunk or desensitized by drugs, or is indifferent to the baby's presence. The smaller and younger the baby, the more possible it is that a rollover might occur, according to recent data.<br>  <br>  Hope you find this helpful as well.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	The big CON is the very real danger of smothering your baby.

I can't wait!!|`|QFNvYVtyaa	The Test/Result line turns pink only if pregnancy hormone is detected. If not, the moisture passes over this strip and does not turn pink. It may, however, become more visible when the light hits the moisture on the strip-- it may appear gray, colorless, like a "dent" in the test, or like a "ghost line." It may appear at any time-- as soon as the urine hits it, after a few minutes as the test absorbs the moisture, or after the 10-minute time limit. It may appear when the test is drying, or after it has dried. It may disappear as the test is drying, or after the test has dried, or not disappear at all.<br>  <br>  The simple fact is that there is always "something there" that is slightly visible-- it's simply the antibodies on the test that would turn pink in the presence of hCG. When the test becomes wet, or as it dries, or after it dries, the antibody strip may become more visible. Therefore, all tests may have them. It is not a defect; it's just how tests are made. <br>  <br>  A real positive is identified by its color (pink or blue, whatever the color of the test's dye is) and its appearance within 10 minutes of urinating on the stick. A line that appears after 10 minutes, regardless of color, must be considered an evap line and is caused by the test's chemicals changing. HPT's are rapid assay diagnostics, which means any results appearing after the "rapid" time limit of 10 minutes are invalid.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  GO TO PEEONASTICK.COM SEARCH FOR DOLLAR TREE TESTS

4sjW4Ig5aa	Let the punishment fit the crime. My son used to have a not so lovely habit of slamming his door when in a fit. I quickly tired of that, and warned him the next time he slammed a door, any door, I was taking his door away. Sure enough, he did, and sure enough I did. I took his door off the hinges. He had a cow. He needed his privacy. How was he supposed to get dressed? He had rights. etc.etc.blah blah blah.<br>  <br>  I calmly explained to him that a door was a privilege. I wasn't required to provide him with one. He could change in the bathroom. Not my problem. If he had wanted to keep his door, he'd have treated it with more respect.<br>  <br>  The same goes for anything else that is being abused or disrespected. Take it away.  If need be, throw it away. She'll get the idea very quickly that you mean business.<br>  <br>  Be creative, let the punishment fit the crime, and be consistent. There is no overnight cure, but over time, if you stick to your guns, she'll get the idea.<br>  <br>  As to my own door slammer, that was when he was 9. He hasn't slammed a door since.

Before then, children merely accept your authority as the ultimate truth. But now she's in the stage where they figure out that you *don't* necessarily know everything, and that she can question you, she doesn't have to respect you unless you have good reason to be respected, etc. I know, you'd like to go back to the days when life was easy and your word was like that of God ;)  Instead of being stressed, think of this as a time to re-examine the way you do things. Explain to her why you have set the household rules that you have...if you can't come up with a satisfying reason for her and yourself, then perhaps that is cause for changing some of those rules ;) Just be patient and understand that she is developing and that isn't a reason to be smacked.|`|RHX1yFb5aa	Why do you feel it wrong to spank your child? I know some ppl disagree with it, but with some children it is the only way. (I am talking about spanking your child on the buttocks with your open hand, not a belt or paddle or on the child's legs) I received a lot of spankings growing up, but I feel that I earned a lot  more than I got. <br>  <br>  As a parent I use spanking only as a last result and can count on one hand how many times I have spanked my daughter.  <br>  <br>  Since your daughter has anger issues, talk to a school counselor or pediatrician to see if they can recommend a child psychologist to you, as this helps my brother tremendously.  He is 12, adopted, special needs and has the mentality of a 6 year old.  He has a lot of psychological issues as he was a crack baby and can not control his anger or emotions.  <br>  <br>  If your child is on medicare or some type of insurance, they should pay for it.  You may need a prescription from her doctor to get the insurance to pay for the psychiatrist, but it would be well worth the effort.  Good luck!|`|I12nj0M7aa	Let her know that her behavior is NOT acceptable. When I was little I was horrible, and my parents didn't believe in spanking so I felt like my behavior had no negative consequences. One day my mom had enough and she starting spanking me whenever I disobeyed or did something bad. I learned pretty quickly because I hated spankings so much. I also have no anger towards her because I would probably still be a brat to this day.|`|gswHFVOAaa	You need to take her to a counselor and maybe if you need to go then go ! Don't ever think that she doesn't love you because she does ! :)|`|ggilREqfaa	Try spanking her every time that she doesnt listen to you|`|ONe2T42Vaa	My sister had the same exact problems with her first daughter, who is younger than yours.<br>  What we learned to be a very good technique is, whenever she does something that you told her not to do, or doesnt do something you told her to do, or whatever the case may be, put her on the wall, dont say a word to her no matter what. Make her stand there with her hands on the wall and nose touching the wall. If she cries, tell her in a strong stern voice, "You WILL stay there until you are DONE crying, and I will tell you when you can get off." If she is crying loud when you say that, just talk right over her and leave the room. If you see her off the wall before you said she can come off the wall, drag her over and put her back, and repeat as neccassary. Even if you have to do it a million times a day, eventually they will get it. Ask before you take them off the wall in a stern serious voice, "Are you done?" If they ignore you ask again, and if still nothing walk away. If they say yes, take them off, sit them down, and tell them why they went on the wall and to not let it happen again, then go on as normal. Remember, no matter how many times you have to do this or how tired you get, they will learn that you are the boss and that you are serious and need to listen or else things will happen.<br>  Try this for a month, and if still nothing happens e-mail me at LaChola_99@yahoo.com<br>  Me and my sister will be more than happy to help, because my niece was OUT OF CONTROL but now she knows more than better.<br>  We don't hit her either unless the people across the street hears her freaking out, but she doesnt lose it really anymore.<br>  If you are stern and serious when needed and playful and loving when needed, they will respect you and love you, and not grow up in the wrong direction.

Not all mothers who take contraceptives containing estrogen will experience a low milk supply, but these unaffected mothers appear to be a very small minority.<br>  <br>  Safety: Both progestin (progesterone) and estrogen are approved by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) for use in breastfeeding mothers. See below for additional information on side effects related to lactation.<br>  <br>   <br>  Progestin-only contraceptives<br>  <br>  Progestin-only contraceptives are the preferred choice for breastfeeding mothers when something hormonal is desired or necessary.<br>  <br>  Progestin-only contraceptives come in several different forms:<br>  <br>      * the progestin-only pill (POP) also called the "mini-pill" (Micronor, Errin, Nor-QD, Ovrette, Microval, etc)<br>      * the birth control injection (Depo Provera)<br>      * the progesterone-releasing IUD (Mirena, Progestasert)<br>      * the birth control implant (Norplant, Implanon).<br>  <br>  Milk supply: For most mothers, progestin-only forms of contraception do not cause problems with milk supply if started after the 6th-8th week postpartum and if given at normal doses. However, there are many reports (most anecdotal but nevertheless worth paying attention to) that some women do experience supply problems with these pills, so if you choose this method you still need to proceed with some caution.<br>  <br>  If you're interested in one of the longer lasting progestin-only forms of birth control (the Depo-Provera shot lasts at least 12 weeks, but effects may be seen up to a year; the Mirena/Progestasert IUD and the Norplant implant can last up to 5 years), it may be a good idea to do a trial of progestin-only pills (mini-pill) for a month or more before deciding on the longer-term form of birth control. If you find that you are among the women whose supply drops significantly due to progestin-only birth control, you can simply discontinue the pills - rather than struggling with low milk supply for several months until the shot wears off or you get the implant or IUD removed.<br>  <br>  Do note that the Mirena/Progestasert IUD delivers its hormone directly to the lining of the uterus, which only leads to a slight increase in progesterone levels in the blood stream (much lower than that found with the progesterone-only pill). As a result, there is much less chance of side effects from the progesterone than from the Depo-Provera shot or mini-pill.<br>  <br>  Milk composition: At higher doses than normal this type of pill can affect the content of breastmilk. At these higher doses it has been shown to decrease the protein/nitrogen and lactose content of the milk. At regular doses, this does not seem to be as likely.<br>  <br>  Safety: Progestin (progesterone) is approved by the AAP for use in breastfeeding mothers. See below for additional information on side effects related to lactation.|`|lJ5Ao2aIaa	Contraceptives that contain only progestins are compatible with breastfeeding and are a safe option, assuming you don't have a medical problem that would preclude the use of this hormone.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, combined contraceptives — so-called because they contain both estrogen and progestin — aren't good choices for a nursing mother, particularly in the first six months, because they may cause you to produce less milk. This applies to all methods that contain estrogen and progestin, such as the combined birth control pill, the vaginal ring (NuvaRing), and the patch (Ortho Evra).<br>  <br>  Hope you find this helpful :)|`|emSPe0YDaa	i started with the mini pill too, but the dr. specified you HAVE to take it the exact same time every day - it works a little different than the regular pill , and if you're not precise in the time you take it, you can get pg. If you miss a dose your chances are more that you will get pg.<br>  i stopped taking any contraceptive, even though they said it was safe, i was afraid of my daughter getting the extra hormones.<br>   in my case, a newborn is contraceptive enough, lol! now, we figure, if it "happens", it happens!|`|AiJeS6I1aa	Yes, yes, yes!  Whether it is the mini pill (progesterone only) or the regular pill (estrogen and progesterone).  The mirena iud is a great choice and there is minimal absorption of progesterone from the iud into the rest of your body.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats for making such a healthy choice for your son!  Get lots of help... breastfeeding can be hard at first, but it is easier and more convenient than bottles once the learning curve is over.  And, for some, it just goes smoothly from day 1.|`|MeYILJeSaa	Yep. They usually give you the mini-pill to start out with until you establish a milk supply, then it;s fine to start on a normal form of birth control.<br>  The concern with normal birth control is that it messes with your milk supply.|`|ndvSK783aa	I'm on low dose birth control.

I would probably be a bit more worried if he was unsettled through the night.<br>  I work in a nursery and we put all babies (0-2yrs)down for a sleep after lunch.

1YdeUn1Caa	My Dr. told me not to quit. Quitting causes stress and will harm the<br>  baby. So I cut back to 5-7 a day. The result. 3 pregnancies, 3 big<br>  and healthy babies. All because I listened to my Dr. His advice<br>  benefited my children.|`|VHHis05Naa	I quit cold turkey and so can you.  Yes, it's hard, but you have the best motivation in the world to quit.  Quit now.  It's a disgusting habit that will affect your health and your baby's health.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Speak to your doctor about a cessation program.  Just do the best you can.  If you can quit completely, do so ASAP.  If not, the less you smoke the better.  <br>  <br>  (And yes, some people will smoke through pregnancy and have healthy babies.  But it's a known risk factor for many health problems, so if you can quit, you avoid those risks.)|`|UYfqzCoMaa	It is hard. I quit cold turkey when I got pregnant with my second child. I didn't smoke before I had my first. I had only started after I had her. Every time that I wanted to pick up a smoke I thought to myself what am I doing to my child? That helped a lot. Just keep going down and it will make it easier to quit. Trust me if I can quit cold turkey so can you. I was smoking a pack and a half a day and did it. I am glad to say that now I haven't smoked since then. Quitting cold turkey was the best thing that I could have done for myself.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	your just gonna have to suck it up. your baby received the first 30% of Oxygen you in hail so the baby will be getting all that smoke, and its not good. Try gum, patches, there are cigarettes  out on the market they cost a lot of money but they dont have nicotine in them and after a while of smoking them it starts to taste nasty and you have no Desire to smoke. Sorry I know its hard to quit but there is NO excuse to smoke during pregnancy|`|s1utniuvaa	My doctors told me not to quit with my first 2 because it would have ended up being worse for the babies but they did want me to cut down as much as I could. I did cut down and my kids were born between 38 and 39 weeks. Both of them were around 7 lbs. Son was 21 inches daughter was 19.5 inches both healthy. I know I'll get a bunch of thumbs downs but it is what it is, I was going on the advice of my doctors.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	well i'm a smoker, and i've tried everything, even prescriptions from my OB/GYN to help me quit, and still haven't. i'm 32 weeks pregnant, so far my baby is perfectly fine. my mom smoked with me and i was born on the due date w/ no health problems at all. also i've had lots of friends who've smoked throughout their pregnancies and their babies were fine.<br>  <br>  i'm not saying it's ok, everyone is different, but my OB/GYN has told me the same thing throughout my pregnancy, if u can't quit, at least cut down to 5 cigarettes a day, which u've already done. this lowers the risk of any harm to be done to the baby.<br>  <br>  if u have Medicaid, call them and ask them if they cover any quit smoking aids. my Medicaid covered the gum, patch, Wellbutrin and Centix. and then talk to ur doctor and ask him wut would be the safest for u to use right now and ask for a prescription. <br>  <br>  good luck.<br>  <br>  EDIT: also, it is true that if u quit cold turkey it could put ur baby through withdrawal, my doctor told me the same thing, but it's not that dangerous while the baby is in the womb. wut is dangerous on the other hand is u quit cold turkey, ur baby goes through withdrawal AND the stress that u're going through on top of it bc u're craving cigarettes. so quit cold turkey only if u can do it without a second thought, u have to make sure ur body won't go through a lot of stress in the process.|`|bW8AJSivaa	I completely understand where you are coming from! I was smoking for 4 years before I found out I was pregnant and when I went to my first ob appointment I was begging for Chantix or something to make it easier! I found that all the new hormonal changes I was experiencing did  not help me quit! At first I cut way back, I was like you, went from a pack a day to just a few. It gets easier, I promise! It took me a couple of months, once the hormones seemed to level out it seemed to be easier and I really just didn't want them anymore. I'm in my third trimester now and let me tell you, in my opinion, if you decide to keep smoking it's not worth it. By the time you get to the third trimester and your baby is pushing against your lungs, just breathing will feel like it takes a lot of effort!|`|VFUdAtrHaa	the most important thing is you are trying to quit and you cut back ALOT thats a great start! Do it at your own pace! your baby will be fine. I smoked regular with my son and he is fine but i cut back with this one and im stopping all together now. I know its hard its just like labor something that takes awhile , its hard but all worth it in the end! Good luck!|`|E5CnUdhsaa	please dont fall for the i smoked and my baby is fine....not all babies are fine thats why people urge you to stop! <br>  <br>  try counselling for smokers...alot of doctors offices have it for smokers. please try to quit...5 a day is still harmful to your lungs...every penny on a packet put it in a bank for the baby. go for a walk instead of lighting up...have a snack|`|BHgtqH9Yaa	I quit when I found out I was pregnant. I just quit cold turkey. You do what you have to to protect your baby. If you are smoking, your baby is smoking and that's not fair to your baby.|`|tnllPS8oaa	NEVER EVER smoke when your pregnant cause you never know. Talk to a doctor about it.Not only does smoking hurt the baby it hurt you|`|sYUUKa7yaa	its a bad idea|`|azE51WGRaa	To all of you who consistently shun those who smoke during pregnancy: It's not like we don't give a s*it when we smoke during pregnancy, it just may be that it is too hard to quit!!! Let's see you give up an addiction in the blink of an eye!!! When you do, then you can criticize!! <br>  To answer your question, it is hard to quit. If you can, then great! But sometimes, with pregnancy and every other stressful thing going on, it may be too hard to quit. The more you cut down, the better. Every cigarette that you can cut back on is a better chance for your baby to be born healthy. I'll admit that I smoke and I'm 37 weeks pregnant. I also went from 2 packs a day down to a half a pack (some days even less). I've been so stressed though, that I have been unable to quit. My son is measuring fine, so I do take some comfort in knowing that my cutting back has done some good. It's super hard to beat an addiction, especially cigarettes. Don't overly stress yourself on trying to quit. Just take it a day at a time and if you can do, then more power to you. But if not, don't feel like a piece of crap just because everyone else wants to judge you without understanding what it's like. For some of us, it's easy to put the habit down. For others, it takes a lot of working and even then we still can't do it. That's just the way it is.<br>  Also: If you ask any doctor, they will tell you that quitting cold turkey can actually be WORSE for the baby as it could make the baby go through withdrawl symptoms the same way it makes the person quitting go through them. If you're gonna quit, do it gradually.|`|HNlw65VLaa	I personally think it can b easier than u think to quit. All u have to do is try smoking 4 a day and then once u have that down u can smoke 3 a day and then u can do 2 and then 1 and then none at all! Try it!|`|wNBbeDhFaa	you will have handy cap kids
AjqO1aJgaa	Will she eat soup?<br>  <br>  Vegetable soup is dead easy to make and a lot of kids like it, especially if you don't tell them what's in it. We had "brown soup" (mushroom), "green soup" (mixed veg) and "orange soup" (carrot) for years :) <br>  <br>  There are hundreds of recipes available, but basically you just cook veg in water and then liquidise the whole lot together. You can also add cream if you want.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Meatloaf with grated veggies in it?<br>  Pasta? (If she'll eat tomato sauce, that's a veggie.  And you can add other veggies too.) <br>  Stew?

The peas/carrots/corn mix are similar in size and make the pasta look festive.  It's not fresh veggies, but it's still healthy.  I put the frozen veg into the boiling water and then it cooks the same time as the pasta does.  With the sauce on top, she might not mind it as much.  You can puree (I know, she hates puree but bear with me here!) some sweeter veggies like carrots or cooked squash and use that in cakes and cookies.  Use honey instead of sugar to sweeten it.  Good luck.|`|Sn72zeBhaa	I put pureed veggies into many of my sauces.  Even mac-n-cheese you can add some squash or light colored veg.  Most pureed veggies are a little sweet.  I do this to the whole meal for everyone, not just a picky eater.  Only once did my husband notice something different in a spagetti sauce.<br>  It might take more time to prepare but this will not last forever.  And like I said, I still do it... Extra veggies can not hurt the family.  They just wonder why I don't worry if they don't eat all their broccoli!!
MMx7TeEBaa	I would only be a surrogate mother for one of my sisters.<br>  Reason for this is because personally i would not be strong enough to give a baby i had carried for 9/10months to a couple i did not really know that well, even if they seemed perfect....it would tear me up inside as i would find it hard to let go of the baby because during pregnancy you have a bond.<br>   But if i was to have a baby for my sisters i would be part of the baby's family and it would not be as hard because i would always see the baby and be in its life forever. <br>  <br>  I think women who are surrogate mothers are amazing and it is a lovely thing to do for a couple.|`|9AP8gf7zaa	only for someone I cared about deeply and if they desperatly wanted the child|`|bcM7Lxpeaa	only if they used there egg or someone Else's not mine because if it was mine swouldn'tdnt be getting the baby|`|H1imIpMqaa	money, and being a good friend|`|obN6p3Cgaa	Only for close family and a best friend......|`|aLAmvX5Naa	While I think I could physically and emotionally handle being a surrogate but I don't want to be one.

I'm not very close to my step-siblings and my cousins are all capable of pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Could you sit by and watch the person carrying your child have free will and do what they want? Imagine a first time mom sitting by while her friend carried her child and did "dangerous" things like eat lunch meat! Gasp! I could just see a lot of nagging on both ends. I'm also a very private person and I'd feel guilty telling my friend/family that she can't be in the room to watch the birth of her child or even for a trans-vaginal ultrasound.<br>  <br>  It would just be too complicated I think.|`|4YIUxSlYaa	I would for my brother or sisters.

I wouldn't go thorough all that pain for someone else to have the baby, only if it was someone I loved and cared for. <br>  It might sound selfish but I would feel dead guilty otherwise.|`|PDJbNAZqaa	I wouldn't because the child will be growing inside of me. Which means I would feel deeply connected to the child. I couldn't deliver it and not raise it.|`|ypJt6poOaa	my mom was a surrogate mother and she's probably going to do it again.<br>  it was great.|`|rUPjr7hjaa	I think so. We'd have to be very close friends though!<br>  I want to be pregnant again very badly, but I don't want another baby yet :)|`|slyLXuROaa	depands on the errson and not if i had any ounce of thaought that i might not want to give the baby up when it is born|`|hWe8vhKKaa	i would do it for my brothers and sisters
2pxiK9waaa	Well, you can't successfully potty train if diapers are still available. At this point, he should be in pull ups at night only, and in underwear all day. Put him on the toilet every 30 min to one hour and let him sit there until he goes. Give him a reward when he does. It'll take a couple of weeks, but he'll be trained in no time.|`|Sn72zeBhaa	My boys both took a long time.  And I didn't rush.  We did make efforts to try, but even after a few successes, I could not get them to stick with it.  When I quit trying, it didn't take long for them to decide on their own.<br>  My oldest had occasional accidents until he was almost 6, and still occasionally bedwets.  Their bladder develops at a pace of its own.  Don't let him feel bad about it, shame will not encourage the training, it will make it harder.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Don't tell her anything except vague comments about him "doing really well".<br>  <br>  Your son's at the old end of normal for being potty trained - but some kids are slower than others, that's just the way it is.<br>  <br>  18 months is ridiculous. The only way a kid is trained at 18 months is if the PARENT trains themself to know when the kid's about to go, and gets very good at catching it. That's not potty trained.<br>  <br>  Have you tried just taking the nappy off? And the underwear? Have him run around with nothing on his bottom half at all for a few hours and observe. Does he know when he's peeing? If so, he's ready to be trained. If not, put the nappy back on and wait another month.|`|lr9E8IC5aa	Don't worry, my oldest was the same way. He wasn't fully potty trained until he was just about your son's age, maybe a few months older.<br>  <br>  He will not be emotionally scarred. My 5 year old still sucks his thumb when he's tired and I really could care less. To each his own.<br>  <br>  Your son will "graduate" when he's ready.|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	Every kid is different. Some kids can't control their bladders fully yet. If her kids could do it, fine. But those are HER kids. She can't criticize you just because your son isn't fully potty trained yet!|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	I partially agree with the second answer, abotu puttinghim in underwear, but at the same time, I know that it is unrealistic to some of us parents to be running to the potty every 10 minutes or cleaning up pee constantly or running numerous loads of dirty laundry. Also when out and about you don't want to have to worry about weather your son is going to pee in the booth, or at the bank, or int eh shopping cart, somethings just aren't feasable. Take him to the store, let him pick out some packs of big boy underwear. Let him run around the house in just the underwear (no clothes = less clean up). If you go out try pull ups. I would still use the diapers at night until he has gained enough control (my daughter still wet the bed up until about 6 months ago and she will be 4 at the end of the month) Also on another note, my daughter was not day time potty trainned until she was just over 3. Try not to let this turn into an arguement with your family, jsut say politely that you are working on it. Best of luck to you!!<br>  <br>  Oh also I heard for little boys when teaching them to stand and pee, there are these dissolvable things you put in the toilet that you can teach him to aim at, he might think thats kind of sun and like it. Also try a potty chart, like he gets a star everytime he uses the potty and once he gets so many stars he gets something special, like a small chocolate or something he likes but isn't allowed much of.|`|AA10120592	No there's nothing wrong with what you're doing. waiting till your son is ready, instead of forcing it and it taking longer, is the best way to go. I did the same with my daughter, and she was potty trained in a week, because we didn't force her on the potty. Don't worry about what other people say.|`|Cx5QtfXXaa	I think 3 years is too long. He needs to be in underwear all day and pull-ups ONLY at night or if you run to the store otherwise while at home or in daycare he should be in underwear so he'll learn that he needs to go...yes, every kid is different and 18 months is not unrealistic...my daughter is 15 months old and is potty trained--on her own!|`|rUPjr7hjaa	She thinks they should be potty trained by 18 months?  That's a tad unrealistic.<br>  I do think 3 years is too long, but if he's not ready then he's not ready.  It can't be helped :)
fudLpR9taa	First of all I would die for my babies.  They are the heart and soul of my wife and I.  We would do anything to protect them.  My wife didn't really start showing until she was about five months along.  Every woman is different so some may show earlier and some may not show at all.  At three months the baby would be about the size of a lime so just over 2 to 3 inches long.  A OB/GYN can tell how the baby is progressing and will measure your cousin's stomach to see how she is growing.  I know how it is with the first child so I totally understand the concern but I am sure everything is just fine.  Good luck to you and your cousin.|`|vomMV5hzaa	1st baby- didn't show till nearly 6 months preggers (boy baby)<br>  2nd baby didn't show till 4 months preggers (girl baby)<br>  3rd little angel- I was 15 weeks when I lost it but you couldn't even tell I was pregnant (had a feeling it was a boy)<br>  <br>  <br>  I think it depends on the baby's position when it attatches to the uterus and the mothers size also.  I am very petite and tend to show a lot later than most people.|`|2grSXmhnaa	my cousin didnt show till she was about 6 months in her first pregnancy, and she is only tiny, I am bigger and have found I have started to put on weight already and have been doing for a few weeks and I am 14 weeks this week, so I guess it cant even depend on yoru body type!<br>  <br>  and I am pregnant it wasnt planned but I know now I wouldnt change it for the world, I wouldnt know what to do if anything went wrong right now so yes sure I would die for my baby!|`|bW8AJSivaa	I was about 6 months before I really started showing. I'm not almost 8 months and it feels like my belly ballooned out over night. I've been told that women show at different times. My doctor said that first pregnancies don't normally show as quickly as second pregnancies because the muscles have not been stretched in that way yet and are still tight.|`|2ImIgJwXaa	I didn't get a bump until almost 5 months. I didn't get huge until about 8 months! So everyone is different. Its probably nothing to worry about.<br>  <br>  And to the second question--Absolutely. I know that he would have people who love him and would care for him as I would.|`|HNlw65VLaa	She has nothing to worry about. When my neighbor was pregnant she didn't start showing till like 4 or 5 months.<br>  <br>  I don't have a baby, but yes, if I had 1 I would die 4 it!|`|yzakyjNKaa	with my first i didnt show  till i was 8 months along and then i looked like i was 4 months<br>  <br>  <br>  yes i would die for my baby and my 2 yr old as well|`|ck5edW9kaa	I was about 5 months before you could start to see the baby bump, and yes I would die for both of my kids they are my world!!!!|`|n3FfpRqCaa	It takes awhile. I didnt really have a noticable bump until about 5 months pregnant.  At 4 months, my clothes were snug.|`|QwPpLgX7aa	I just had my first child in Jan. and I did not show any until I was 24 weeks.  It is  completely normal to not be showing now.  As long as she is gaining weight then everything is ok.  Congrats and good luck!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  I would definitely die for my daughter. I would so anything to help her or make her happy!!!|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Tell her not to worry. Women start showing at different stages. I didn't start showing until 4 months. <br>  <br>  Yes I would die for my baby. She's my world.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	By now your cousin should have seen a Dr. anyways.  It's perfectly fine not to be showing yet.<br>  Yes, I would die for my son.|`|5RoYyprkaa	Some women don't start showing until 5 or 6 months. It depends on her frame and build. When my roommate got pregnant, she weight 110 pounds, and by 3 months, she just looked like she was gaining weight. By 5 months, it had rounded out more and looked like a baby bump. A girl I went to high school got pregnant, and was 26 weeks along before she started showing.<br>  <br>  And yes, I would die for my baby if I could ever have one.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	If it is her first then it is normal for her not to be showing yet. I would absolutely die for my baby. If I had a chance to give that child life even if it meant losing my own I would do it in a heart beat.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	Yes, totally normal some women show their bumps early some later.<br>  <br>  yes, i would die for my son. i havent seen or held him but i already love him and i would give up my life for him in a heartbeat|`|c8e5d630616fd991d57af8eb76b7b3fbaa	I just really started showing a few weeks ago, I am 6 months pregnant.<br>  <br>  Yes I would die for my baby.|`|AA11220327	this is totally normal, especially if this is a first pregnancy. most women in a first pregnancy dont show at all in the 1st trimester, but she will start soon, dont worry. I know women that have not started showing untill 6 or 7 months. typically women will show faster in 2nd or higher pregnancies, because the uterus already has a memory of going into that shape, but even that sometimes doesnt happen. <br>  As for the other question, i wouild willing die for all of my kids if there was ever a choice.|`|LyatdgVZaa	It's perfectly normal to not see a baby bump, but if she is really worried about it then she can go and see her doctor. The more reassurance the better, right? But from personal experience, the only thing I had going at three months was that my clothes were a tiny bit tighter in the hips. <br>  <br>  As for the other question, I would absolutely die for my baby as long as it meant she would live. She is my whole world. Well, my family is my whole world, but you get what I mean.|`|uJJPFJoyaa	3 months pregnant is still very early in the pregnancy for any sign of a "baby bump" to show. All women are different, some show early and some show later in their pregnancy. I didn't notice a bump after 5months, strangers and friends didn't notice til around my 6month.<br>  <br>  Yes, I would die for my baby.|`|2B2fgmw9aa	Ummm... totally normal that she sees nothing yet. Most women don't notice until they are well into their second trimester, especially if they weren't stick thin to begin with.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh and what woman in their right mind wouldn't die for their child?!?! You guys are bored, lol|`|Bg6txvxqaa	No, don't worry, I'm pregnant with twins and I didn't start showing until I was about 15 weeks.<br>  <br>  Some women don't start showing until they are about 30 weeks! Depends on where the baby is positioned and the build of the woman carrying.|`|GUUgeptjaa	She might not show until later, due to it being her first, with my first I did not show until about 5 months and then wow I popped out<br>  <br>  yes I would die for my babies, without question|`|KMtd5gr0aa	She is too early for a bump i am almost 5 months and just starting to see one. Also yes i would die 4 any of my kids.|`|7b2ddd2f8ffad9c0b9a57aea08694331aa	I didn't start showing until 3 months. And I had a really small frame before. I just started showing, and it's like doubled every week. I definitely feel pregnant now. Don't worry, she'll be just fine. The doctor would have mentioned something if the baby looked too small.<br>  <br>  That's a really open question. Not much elaboration. If I were in a car accident with my baby, and I had to choose to save myself or my baby, I'd save my baby. If the baby was going to kill me during labor, I'd have to say I'd save myself. It'd be hard, but since the dad isn't involved, I'd feel really bad about leaving my baby with no mom and no dad. Not to mention, I'm not 100% sure my family would take it in...<br>  <br>  Good luck!
5RoYyprkaa	I'm sorry about your mother. My aunt had breast cancer that progressed into bone cancer, and sadly she lost the battle with cancer a few months after she was diagnosed. All of this happened a mere 6 weeks after I lost my father in a car accident. I know that it's hard, but if she's responding well to treatments, then there's a good chance that she will go into remission. <br>  <br>  Try putting things that she likes or needs often down lower. Put things that she can't get to ( like things upstairs that she likes) downstairs. Make sure she can find or see everything that she needs.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you and your family will make everything as easy as you can for her.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	I;m really sorry<br>  I think you should get rid of all big furniture. (so you have more room)<br>  and if you have carpet get rid of it. It will be hard for her to move with carpet.<br>  <br>  Good luck and God Bless<br>  :)?|`|2Q1niQAvaa	So sorry.. but pick up any floor rugs.... those little guys are the #1 cause of falls, and will cause problems for the wc. <br>  But it sounds like you are a very mature person. She is very lucky to have you as a child, and with your positive attitude, she will be so happy to have you helping her at home, and will be so much more comfortable.|`|9773a1274f33361977f590679b7c92a8aa	I'd make the living room her new bedroom.  Buy some of those stand up folding (Shoji) Japanese privacy walls.  <a href="http://www.chopa.com/ShopSite/low_shoji.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.chopa.com/ShopSite/low_shoji....</a> .  Mount the TV up on a wall bracket so she can see it easier when she's lying down.  Also, get one of those remotes with the really large buttons.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend getting her a wireless doorbell and mounting the buzzer on her bed on the side she has use of for her arm, the bells can be mounted where you guys can hear it, so she can get help when she needs it.  I'd get one of those tables, like they had at the hospital for easier access to stuff.  They make ones with a lip on the edges so stuff won't easily roll or slide off. <br>  <br>  Make her as comfortable as possible.  Always have her favorite flowers out, spend as much time with her as possible.  <br>  <br>  It sound like it is a terminal situation and I'm really sorry to hear you're going through something like this.
edzU8VJiaa	Don't think so.  What you are suggesting is calling her sweaty (ie covered in perspiration).<br>  <br>  Even if it's "Sweetie Pie", how would you like to have to put that on forms when you're 60 years old? (Or at any age, really...)<br>  <br>  I would think the poor child would suffer total embarrassment all her life; talk about low self-esteem....|`|Elxuvon8aa	yuck sounds like a cookie|`|Cj4i2pbTaa	I don't think I understand.  Do you mean to say "Sweetie Pie", and as a nickname?|`|3qCOYHTaaa	maybe as a nickname while there in the age 1-3 range but not as a full-on name. sorry|`|2jrffIoWaa	no.|`|3AlFMrA5aa	im sorry Creeper, but ur not the next Slappy|`|dNtnYBblaa	Well, sure, for the first couple years of her life.

pvrLSTZzaa	Make sure that you and your husband talk about when you will be able to have alone time. You are going to be really busy with a new baby AND moving. With our second child, I took a nap when my husband got home from work. Another idea is to go to bed a couple hours early. That way you can get a couple hours of sleep while your husband watches the baby and getting up at night wont be as hard. You also need to have something that you can do by yourself (read, do puzzles, scrapbook) and make sure to keep in touch with your friends and family!|`|Kq1zpgU5aa	Aww. Congratulations! I would just prepare yourself for a long day. Get a lot of baby toys and diapers. Baby toys such as the kind where it will keep them occupied for more than about three seconds. Blocks are fun, build a small "tower" then let them knock it down, eventually, when the are a little older (7 months or something) you will get a funny laugh from that. Make a big deal out of it.

You may get bored but stick it out.  Before I gave birth for the first time, I read many many books on parenting.  But much of what I did came naturally because my own mother was gifted.  I wrote a book on the subject of successful parenting by following natural mothering principles.  You can look at my profile if you want to seek out that information.  There are so many nurturing principles, I can't list them all here.  You can also write to me if you'd like.  One more thing, don't listen to criticism about staying home with your children ;o).

fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Bigger pieces.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.borstvoeding.com/voedselintroductie/blw/engels.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.borstvoeding.com/voedselintro...</a><br>  Many parents worry about babies choking. However, there is good reason to believe that babies are at less risk of choking if they are in control of what goes into their mouth than if they are spoon fed. This is because babies are not capable of intentionally moving food to the back of their throats until after they have developed the ability to chew. And they do not develop the ability to chew until after they have developed the ability to reach out and grab things. The ability to pick up very small things develops later still. Thus, a very young baby cannot easily put himself at risk because he cannot get small pieces of food into his mouth. Spoon feeding, by contrast, encourages the baby to suck the food straight to the back of his mouth, potentially making choking more likely.<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  There is no need to cut food into mouth-sized pieces. Indeed, this will make it difficult for a young baby to handle. A good guide to the size and shape needed is the size of the baby's fist, with one important extra factor to bear in mind: Young babies cannot open their fist on purpose to release things. This means that they do best with food that is chip-shaped or has a built-in 'handle' (like the stalk of a piece of broccoli). They can then chew the bit that is sticking out of their fist and drop the rest later – usually while reaching for the next interesting-looking piece. As their skills improve, less food will be dropped.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i just started my 9 mo old on the chunkies; at first she swallowed it all whole, but now, about a week later, she is starting to gum at it before she swallows....he may not be ready if he's gagging and such, just try again in a few weeks....|`|AjqO1aJgaa	It sounds odd, but...make the chunks bigger.<br>  <br>  Lots of babies are confused by small lumps, but cope well with big pieces that they can chew on while they are holding them.

75zggy81aa	good luck, i was induced and loved it! My labor went SO FAST. They gave me pitocin so if you get pitocin brace yourself it makes your contractions more painful then natural contractions. I think I was at a 4 when i got my epidural, so if its in your birth plan you can ask for it pretty quickly. I was induced at 10am and gave birth at 5:43 pm  I pushed through 4 contractions and she was out! CONGRATS|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I chose to induce because I was in the military and I had family flying in from out of state to be there for the birth. I didn't want them to take time off work and me to not go into labor. I waited until I was 39W5D to induce. I went to the hospital at 7:30am, checked in went up to L&D got in my gown and my bed and all hooked up to the monotors. They came in and gave me my IV and I asked for anxiety medicine because I was VERY scared, They gave me some drug I don't even remember in the same IV I got my pitocin in and I went loopy. I was looped up. I don't even remember a lot of the little things, my doc came in and popped my water at 9:30am. I was dilated to a 2.5 for 2 weeks before I went into labor and thought it was going to be a breeze, I sat there for another few hours not dialing at all. My mom left for lunch and when she came back I decided I wanted to take the epidural because the contractions were close together. They didn't even hurt a little bit but I knew if they started to hurt that I wouldn't be able to sit still for the epidural (like I said, I didn't dilate AT ALL) so they came in, gave me the epidural, told me it was going to be a "slight bee sting" it was very painful but only lasted a few seconds (and I'm a wuss with little pains like that)  they layed me back, gave me the catheter and checked my dilation.....9.5. I went from a 2.5 to a 9.5 in about an hour or two. My doc was in the room next to me delivering a baby and then she came in and delivered mine. I pushed for about 20 minutes. The epidural made me numb from about my boobs down (I didn't like it at all) and I was getting really angry when I was being told I wasn't even pushing. A few pushes later my son was in my arms.  I went in at 7:30am and had my son in my arms at 2:36pm.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	get some sleep and lots of rest<br>  eat a healthy meal <br>  induction can be harder and longer i was in it for 18 hrs and was so tired no sleep as i didnt have a epi<br>  good luck tho we are all diffenert and goes diff for all|`|AA10071149	I was induced with my daughter. First, my water was broken at 7:30am. We waited for a few hours to see if any contractions would start and when they didn't, I was given Pitocin. Contractions soon followed and at 5 cm I requested an epidural. I was ready to push at 9pm and, with the assistance of a vacuum, I delivered at 9:18pm. There were complications with the baby and they needed her out so I was given a fourth degree tear (Ouch!!) and the vacuum was used.|`|sqaey2Siaa	I was induced with my son. They used pitocin however. I went in at 12 and started the pitocin drip and was ready to push around 6 45 that night. It makes contractions stronger and more sharp, but the epideral helps a good bit. Youll be fine.|`|peQGGFPYaa	i was induced with both of my pregnancies, but i was put on pitocin right away. My first was 8 hours of labor and my second was 6 hours.|`|a67f223481e1f00da8ea5d7d5f8d576caa	Sounds like I was a rare case... I was induced for hypertension as well and on magnesium sulfate and pitocin both.  NOT FUN.  Anyway I was in labor for 30 hours and tense as can be so I finally got the epidural and began to dilate.  Another 10 hours later and she was in distress they said and rushed me to the OR.<br>  <br>  Be sure to use every tool to relax possible.  It makes a world of difference in accelerating your delivery and in pain management.|`|KMtd5gr0aa	I was induced with 3 of mine and all 3 i had to have the pitocin. 1st baby i was in labor 10 hours 2nd baby was 8 hours and 3rd baby was 17 hours, The last baby after all the hours of pain i ended up having a c section. I also didnt have any pain meds with any of the kids. Well when i went into the emergency c section i did ofcourse but thats it.|`|CQTV4ntqaa	My daughter was so overcooked. She was suppose to be due on June 12 and they induced labor on June 20. I was admitted into the hospital on June 19 at 7p.m. They gave me some type of medication to help me go into labor but by 8 am., the doc broke my water bag. <br>  <br>  Needless to say, thank goodness for drugs because the split second my water broke, the contractions started. I delivered my daughter at 5:36pm. So labor was for about only 8 hours or so. <br>  <br>  Good luck!! They say you forget the pain once your child is born. Honestly, that bs , but its so worth it!!|`|M6tyMdJqaa	i WAS INDUCED 2 TIMES AND NEEDED POTOCIN BOTH TIMES. JUST ENJOY YOUR NIGHT AND HAVE FUN TOMORROW.  IT MAY TAKE A LONG TIME AND IT MAY TAKE A COUPLE HOURS EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT. MY FIRST TIME WAS 8 HOURS AND MY SECOND WAS 6 HOURS. GOOD LUCK AND CONGRATULATIONS...IAM JEALOUS I STILL HAVE 11 WEEKS LEFT|`|sR9XV5Z1aa	I was induced with my son and they used the gel, first night done nothing so they re-applied in the morning and he was born in 45 minutes.<br>  You must be soooo excited that it's nearly here, good luck!!|`|n3FfpRqCaa	I was induced with Pitocin due to being overdue.  My water broke on its own about 2 hours after I received Pitocin & it was 19 hours of labor until I had my baby.
qCe9Pnlgaa	It's a little discouraging, but remember, teen girls are extremely fertile. They can get pregnant almost any time of the month. The older we get, the harder we have to 'try'. You should expect it to take up to one year to get pregnant. Have sex every day and twice a day during your fertile week. Stay away from coffee and alcohol and you will probably get pregnant right away. It worked for us. We tried for 2 months. :)  Good luck!|`|1fQJlHJIaa	i have been the same i had a miscarriage in dec me and hubby been ttc since sept and a young 18yr old at work is preg due in may (not planned baby),i just felt terrible when i had to retur back to work after losing baby and seeing this young girl now single living with parents not sure if she actullty wanted baby.and we so do i felt jealous for a time.<br>  <br>  unfourtunltey i think this is quite normal.<br>  i feel a whole lot brighter about it now though.|`|JDJRRcJsaa	Thats the way the world works im afraid! ive been ttc for two years now, i know alot of people who have taken along time to concieve but they achieved it in the end, 7 months is not that long really ( although i know it seems like it) im sure it will happen for you, i still believe it will happen for me i just wish we had more control over it,life would be much easier x x|`|6Z4fKZ8aaa	I have been TTC for 29 periods and 29 months. BFN 12/18/2006 @ 19 years old. BFN 10/30/2008 @ 21 years old.  22 years old now. Two false pregnancies; 1 at 19 and 1 at 20.  LMP was 2/2/2009.  Yes I do get annoyed and depressed when I see other people, both teenagers and older women getting pregnant when they don't even want the baby or will just put it up for adoption or abort it and I can't get pregnant,but everything is from God. Don't give up hope on getting pregnant.  If possible, try something else like a hobby to take your mind off of getting pregnant. I'm currently in my 2nd semester of college, studying for my A.S. degree in Early Childhood Education.  Actually the 20s are a woman's prime fertility time.  Once you hit 30, your fertility decreases, and once you hit 35 your fertility increases dramatically.  Teenagers are more fertile then all other women combined because their eggs are still fresh. A woman is born with all the eggs she will ever use. She loses around 12,000 eggs a year and by the time she gets her first period, she's already lost a lot of eggs.  As a woman ages, her eggs also age and disintegrate.  A woman can NOT get pregnant after her first period. She usually ovulates 12 to 18 months after her first period. So contrary to popular belief, a woman can not get pregnant right away after her first period.|`|b0ff0526fe90638f8e2ac0fea7c1171caa	My bf and I have been trying for 15 months and yes it makes me mad, sad, angry, jealous...all of the above when it seems like EVERY1 is getting pregnant but me. My BF and I have been together for 5 years....both have good jobs, live together, late 20's and its just not happening for us. <br>  <br>  Theres nothign we can do but live our life and not be envious of others. Who knows what their story or deal is. I truely belive things happen for a reason. I know it will be our time eventually I just hope its sooner than later. Good luck with getting pregnant again. Look at this way.....at least you have one child. I would do anything in this world to be able to have what u have. So see...you can be jealous of others while others can be jealous of you. Its a vicous cycle. I hope we allllll get pregnant!!!!! Except for the little girls that dont even want to be :)|`|4WNeBRjVaa	It is discouraging and it hurts every time I hear about it and I get jealous really quick but then I remember that I'm going to be bringing a baby into a warm healthy environment and enriching their lives. I think some of those Moms 14,15,16 year olds will do a good job. But just remember that you waited until you could bring a baby up the right way. Baby dust you're way!!|`|N89HLv92aa	It is aggravating, because they dont know how much some people want what they have.  My husband and I have been trying for 16 months. He has a low sperm count.  I get jealous of people all the time to the point I skip their baby showers and dont come to see the baby. Thats aweful I know but it hurts me to see the babies.|`|WWfL5tMvaa	Well, i think the younger the woman is the higher the chances but still there are older women and they still get pregnant easily.<br>  some times i think how can women who do not want babies get pregnant but us TTCers we keep trying and trying. I guess it is just life every one get a share but in different ways. <br>  i wish you all the best of luck<br>  BABY DUST TO ALL OF US TTCERS|`|N0rMaN3Waa	i completely understand. It too is hard for me.  I not only see younger pregnant girls but It seems that everywhere I go women are pregnant.  Not only that but I work part time at a maternity store... hello! they are all pregnant or just had the baby! that really suck... you get all the complaints about being pregnant and here i am praying to any god that will listen to me that if i get pregnant ill do anything.. give me the worst pregnancy and ill still be happy... on top of that its hard seeing people that I know are pregnant. My friend had a baby then she got with a new guy and though she was pregnant again and she doesnt even like him! i was like wow... all I want is to be pregnant with my boyfriend that I will marry and love to death, but it seems like everyone else is pregnant.. and literally at work they all are... it makes me very sad and discouraged... i keep trying to stay positive.. my boyfriend helps with that... he says every month i get a BFN its just one more month to try again! GOOD LUCK AND BABY DUST TO ALL!!!!!
iCejKSpSaa	i'm in the same boat. my discharge is like slick (snot) and stretchy. but i only got it for two days. let me know when you find out. baby dust!!!|`|YIb23obFaa	i dont know for sure but i have heard from several people and things online that clear discharge is a sign of pregnancy. good luck|`|ObngKaoWaa	me too! i ovulated around the 4th of march but have had a discharge since then.yesterday and this morning it was kinda yellowish but in the afternoon today it was creamy white.
qo79EUHKaa	I say you should just take a home test or go to the doctors and take a test there. I prefer going to the doctors because if you are pregnant you can start early on prenatal care and start learning new things early. There is a chance that you are. I seen that you said you haven't had any symptoms...well everybody's body is different and handles everything in different ways. Also some people don't even experience much symptoms during their 1st trimester.|`|P19m74Itaa	There is a chance that you are pregnant since you had unprotected sex. My advice is to take a pregnancy test. Either way you should not be having severe back pain.|`|sweB7TRkaa	The only advice i can give you is take a pregnancy test and if you are you will just have to tell your boy friend.|`|VeN2WBOOaa	Yea. There is definatly  possiblity. It take a test.|`|5RoYyprkaa	Test. It's the only way to know for sure. Lower back pain could be a sign of just a late period.|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	ya you could be take a test to be sure

sxecXFgraa	If you know and trust the family, I would let him go.  Get him a prepaid cell phone so he can call you anytime.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Has he even been invited?<br>  <br>  If and when they ask him to come with them, you need to have a long discussion. But this sounds like it's missing a step - it's a long way from "my son's friend is going to the beach and my son wants to go" to "my son's friend's parents are happy to take someone else's 8 year old on holiday with them".|`|GMIsOYYCaa	Yes, he can get into trouble. But he can get into trouble doing a lot of other things too...going to school, being at home, going to the park. Life in general has its benefits and consequences. There are risks involved in almost anything, but you have to think of the benefits as well. Your son is benefiting every time he hangs out with his friends. Social development plays a big part in your child's life. Even though it may not seem like a big deal to you, because he is so young still, he is still rapidly developing his social skills, and you letting him be with his friends would only improve his self-esteem within his friendship circle. It would also increase the trust and parent-child bond that you have, that you trust him enough to go on the trip.<br>  <br>  think about it =)|`|Kbz8XEf9aa	I would let my son go if I knew the parents and trusted them. It really depends on your relationship with them and for how long he is going.. I would say 2 days max..cuz i would get paranoid after that lol. Just make sure they phone you everyday and update you|`|ZZztSumhaa	I would let my son go, if you do know these people and its only for a few days im sure things will be fine. You could lend your son a cell phone for the few days and call him to check up on things.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I'd get to know the parents and then decide. Have them over for dinner and get to know them . I'd only let him go if i knew the parents and were comfortable with them.|`|tTaDBaM4aa	Do what your gut feeling tells you to do!  If your gut feeling on everything is always no then maybe you need to examine that.  If you believe in God pray about it!  I can't tell you how many times I had a bad feeling about something my three boys wanted to do over the years.  Almost every time later I found out there was a legitimate reason I felt that way and was glad I had made the decision I made.  No one ever wants to say no to there kids for no reason but sometimes just a bad feeling about it is enough as a parent.|`|hzZyNJGWaa	first find out as many details as you can, where, who, what they will be doing, will there be constant supervision, then decide
OG661H9qaa	yes..if itis light pink or brown blood that this is implntation bleeding..you can wait for 1 week and then can take a test...|`|D0oqTblpaa	Sex can cause light spotting.  If your vagina is irritated or dry it can cause small abrasions (scrapes) in the vagina that bleed a little. <br>  <br>  If you are two weeks late take a test.

Not that he doesn't still from time to time.<br>  <br>  I also recommend a vinyl floor mat.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	He thinks its hilarious.<br>  <br>  Make things easy for you clean up so you don't go insane, and you might want to only feed him when he's really hungry.|`|RgEtKVaKaa	I remember this so well.  I read that if a child does this, mom should take his/her food & the meal is over.  No way!  I dealt with this by ignoring it - & by keep a lot of damp cloths close by.    It will stop - when he is on to something else.  Hopefully,his next trick will be less messy.  Good luck to you.  Good luck to you.  Enjoy this - it will be over soon & as you said, he thinks it is hilarious.  ;o]
yQ0OzEbZaa	Big Mistake #1, #2, #3 etc. I feel a woman should first be married and financially stable to bring a child into the world or even a whole litter of kids.

sxecXFgraa	That sounds just like normal discharge and it happens everyday.  If it starts changing colors and/or starts smelling, then you may have a yeast infection or something else so you should see your doctor.|`|Zb7CtLxbaa	It's called discharge. Unless it a color other than white (yellow, green, brown) or has a bad odor, it's completely normal. You should start your period between 6-12 months after you begin producing this discharge.|`|vdhU2IWhaa	As long as it is white with no foul smell its normal.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Its called discharge. And it is very normal for a women/girl to have 2 teaspoons of discharge a day|`|maSZlX5Yaa	Oh that's discharge for you!
hSJnaysiaa	I like Maximilian.<br>  <br>  Corizo sounds too much like "chorizo" which is a mexican sausage 'nuff said...<br>  <br>  Raikas is a bit too foreign sounding for my taste.<br>  <br>  Same goes for Loic.<br>  <br>  Is Kaiel pronounced like "Kyle"? I don't like it when people spell common names differently..<br>  <br>  Thaddeus I like, Thaddy the nickname is cute.<br>  <br>  Sascha I always equate to being a girls name.<br>  <br>  Tybalt I like, shakespearean.<br>  <br>  Cannon, this is ok. We considered Gunner and Diesel for our son so Cannon isn't too far off.<br>  <br>  Alakai is sort of like Malachai, reminds me of alkaline batteries though.<br>  <br>  Mikey or any variants of michael are too common.<br>  <br>  Our list of boys names before choosing a name was:<br>  <br>  Jude<br>  Stetson<br>  Trey<br>  Maverick<br>  DIesel<br>  Jaegar "Jaggy"<br>  Atticus<br>  Talon<br>  Darwin<br>  Frey<br>  Gunner<br>  Mannix<br>  Slade<br>  <br>  So we like different-ish names.|`|dMLLQruOaa	Maximilian (Max)-Eh its ok. Not unusual or out of the ordinary to me. <br>  Corizo-Absolutely awful. Looks like Chorizo a mexican sausage<br>  Raikas-Not a fan, but im sure somewhere this is a normal name, just not for me.<br>  Loic-Nope, dont like it.<br>  Kaiel-Okay, but still wouldnt choose it.<br>  Thaddeus (Thaddy)-More normal, i like THAD for short<br>  Sascha-If its pronounced SASHA, thats pretty normal, and cute.<br>  Tybalt (Tybbie)-EH its unusual, and doesnt sound like a name.<br>  Cannon-Its ok. Sounds like a last name to me though<br>  Alakei (pronounced Alla-key, actually my son's middle name)- I accually would have loved it if it were ALLEKAI, allekey is cute. <br>  Mikey-Cute, not unusual though|`|ln0wLqZhaa	Maximilian - I know a girl who just named her baby this i personally don't like it  Tho max is a cute name .<br>  <br>  Corizo - nope<br>  Raikas-no<br>  Loic-no<br>  Kaiel - I heard this name a couple times around don't like it .<br>  Thaddeus- never<br>  Sascha- no<br>  Tybalt- nuh uh <br>  Cannon - no <br>  Alakei -  I think it's one of those names the more u say it the more u like it kind of deal. <br>  Mikey - I know lots of mikeys it's usually a nickname for Micael  , but i would use this one if i had to pick  one off this list to use lol|`|nYioXmnGaa	ME personally would not use any of those names|`|ppBYeYG9aa	I think their all pretty cool names but personally i would not use them. Maybe Alakei or Sascha except i'd spell it Sasha|`|D2Vkk5WDaa	I like Cannon.|`|Elxuvon8aa	Thaddeus is the only one I would use and did the others are just to out there for me|`|cErLq7f3aa	Cannon is one of my favorites.<br>  i know a Maximilian.  but he goes by Max.<br>  Loic is okay.<br>  and i like Thaddeus.<br>  i have a cousin named Mikey.|`|edzU8VJiaa	I don't think I would use any of these.  My own opinion is that you shouldn't give a child a name that people have to check how to spell.  It's awkward for the child when they are younger, and embarrassing for them when they are older.<br>  <br>  How would you like to go through life with people constantly asking "How do you spell that?.....|`|1y1c5QWHaa	On a scale of one to ten:<br>  Maximilian - 0<br>  Corizo - 2<br>  Raikas - 0<br>  Loic - 1<br>  Kaiel - 0<br>  Thaddeus - 2<br>  Sascha - 4<br>  Tybalt - 0<br>  Cannon - 1<br>  Alakei - 3<br>  Mikey - 2<br>  <br>  Definitely unusual name!|`|Vi5SCyr9aa	Thaddeus is okay|`|tpSSka4taa	I think they are lovely brave choices but not for me. Im more of a Joshua or Hayden kinda gal!
33361f975202a28024124ac0b9d8b821aa	I don't think things will change when you have the baby.  If anything he seems like the type of guy who will become resentful of the attention you need to give the baby.  Sounds like he's already resentful.  <br>  <br>  Not wanting to be alone is not a good enough reason to stay with this guy.  If hes not willing to be a partner in raising this child, which it sounds like he isn't, you are better off just you and the baby.  Don't tie yourself down with someone who seems very childish and has so little going for him.<br>  <br>  It may be hard in the beginning, but it will be better off not getting 'stuck' with this guy in the long run.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|5RoYyprkaa	It might be a stage, but then again it might not. I know plenty of teen moms whose boyfriend's NEVER treated them that way or acted like your boyfriend. Most guys who aren't selfish generally understand and will try to make things comfortable for you. While I know they sometimes got irritated with the mood swings and the crazy cravings, they knew it was because their girlfriend was carrying their child.<br>  <br>  Stress isn't good for you or baby, so you might want to think about kicking him to the curb until he grows up and matures enough to be a father.|`|38902e2ce5f8ef4d27715901e6c92e15aa	I have read in a mens book on pregnancy that they get really, really stressed out when they are going to become a dad. They are always worried about whether or not they will be able to support the family finacially. I would give him a break. Especially since you said that he doesn't have anything, car, etc. This is a really stressful time in his life, more so than you think, no need to add to it.
rDPADat1aa	That's called an anterior placenta and I've had it in at least two of my four pregnancies.  I'm not sure about my first, I'd have to look into it.  With my third, it didn't cause any problems at all.  My doctor hasn't mentioned that it could cause problems with this fourth baby either.  The only thing that it really does is make it more difficult to feel baby kicking in the beginning.  The placenta acts like a cushion, blocking the mother from feeling the lighter kicks.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.|`|AA10976444	Its fine...the placenta can attach anywhere on the utuerus.  As long as it isn't attached low in the placenta its fine.|`|AA11220327	that is where mine is this time around, and my midwife has had no concerns about it being a problem. the only problem she has said about it is that it can make feeling the baby kick from the outside for others may be more difficult because the placenta is blocking the outside of my skin|`|D0oqTblpaa	As long as it's attached and not covering or partially covering your cervix then it's fine.  The placenta ends up where it does depending on where the fertilized egg implants.  As your baby and uterus grows the placenta tends to move up to the top or rather the bottom of the uterus gets bigger and the placenta stays where it is. <br>  <br>  If your placenta is placed funnily they will catch it in the 20-25 scan.  The position and size of the placenta is something that they measure.|`|sR9XV5Z1aa	I had a low placenta with 4 of my pregnancies, but somehow it moves out of the way before birth. If your concerned, just ask your ob next visit.|`|PfIywLLyaa	Should be fine as long as it is not covering the cervix.|`|YHUk1jTMaa	if it's not attached over old scar tissue and its not over your cervix than there is no foreseeable problem.
JOVWBOOCaa	They will normally schedule an ultrasound about 20 weeks and you will find out then what you are having. I have heard that boys can be seen around 16 weeks on ultrasound. They do it at 20 weeks just to be more accurate, I had mine a couple weeks early because I was going out of town and I found out I was having a girl. I would say anywhere from 17-20 weeks to find out the sex. Maybe you will get lucky though! A baby can hear you by 20 weeks as well and will recognize your voice at birth! Good luck and Congrats|`|XFzmoatYaa	You should be going in for an ultrasound at 20 weeks. At 20 weeks they can tell what you are having. Unless your baby is being a pain in the butt and has crossed leggs lol :):) Good luck!
hdzlWALdaa	my son is almost 9 months n is the same. after seeing my frnds baby crawling around everywer n her having to chase after him n not be able to relax, i decided theres definately no rush!!<br>  <br>  my son babbles n mumbles. he says "nana" n "mamama" but i knw they dnt mean anything, many ppl believe that wen they say "mamama" then its actually refering to his/her mum, when most of the time its just new sounds|`|mO2oOqZ3aa	My son is almost 11months, NO desire whatsoever to crawl, we actually had him evaluted about a week ago, he is on a 6month old level for his gross motor skills(crawling), but on a 10-11 month level for fine motor and cognitive skills...all babies develope diffently. Some babies skip crawling all together, we were concerned and with good reason, if you are concerned ask your doctor, and if he/she is concerned they can recommend someone to evaluate your baby!<br>  My son has a weaker upper body.|`|3CVfUiiJaa	My son is also 9 months old and he is no where near crawling.  He doesn't even get up on his knees.  I keep on showing him and encouraging him...I think he is just lazy and more interested in standing up.<br>  His vocabulary consists of "mammma" "gaagaa" "corsh" and "goooo"  lol I don't know what anything means but I have conversations with him all day lol.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	My son couldn't even sit up then :)<br>  <br>  Sat up at 10 months, crawled around 11 months, walked and talked around 18 months. Now 9 years old with a reading and comprehension age of "adult".<br>  <br>  In other words, don't panic :) But do mention it to your doctor or health visitor next time you see them, and certainly if she's still not trying to move around (doesn't have to be crawling, lots of babies bumshuffle) in another couple of months.|`|rFtKFp03aa	My triplets are 9 1/2 months old.. <br>  <br>  My girl does not crawl or even try to get in that position.. she just watches her brothers.. which one of them just started crawling literally yesterday and my other boy just rocks on all fours... <br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry about your daughter yet.. <br>  <br>  For words.. not sure.. <br>  <br>  My guys just say mamamamama  dadadadadadada nanananana babababa lol :)|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	i wouldnt worry unless your babies not even sitting up yet, one of my children never really crawled just pulled them self up at the furniture and instantly walked, my eldest crawled at about 10/11 months and walked at 16 months|`|4YIUxSlYaa	My daughter crawled two days after she was 8 months.  I wouldn't worry, some babies never crawl!|`|iMaTMWMxaa	My daughter didn't crawl until past her 1st birthday. She stood up for the 1st time when she was 16 months, but didn't walk until she was 18 months. She spoke very early.<br>  <br>  My son crawled at 6 months, walked at 10 months, but didn't talk until he was 3 years. <br>  <br>  If you hold your daughter up and put her legs on your lap, does she push? Does she bear weight on her legs. If not, I'd get her checked out. My daughter didn't bear weight and she had x-rays, and everything was fine, but just something to look out for.|`|aMrDFGdLaa	I wouldn't worry about it. I didn't learn to walk until 2! It was probably because my mom carried me everywhere. And when I did walk, it was at the doctor's office, in front of the pediatrician. My mom brought me there because she was worried I'd never learn. Go figure.|`|0ZjQp78Daa	well our son never crawled at all, he just pulled himsilf up one day and started to walk. believe me she will surprise you soon and when she does you will probably wish she didnt cause she will have her hands in everything.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	my daughter said her first word at 7 months and was crawling then too. babies develop differently. your baby might not even crawl she may go straight to walking
