nAvTMXmgaa	Yes you can do it by yourself. But you should start with a begginer CD, Because it seem easy but its not at all.<br>  Everybody can do it, Its very relaxing altough when you firlst start its a little weird because of the poses.<br>  Nop, No need to be very flexible it will improve with the time thats why you should start with a begginer Cd, And if you CANT  flex you legs all the way you can just bend them a little. Or do poses in one knee instead of your foot.<br>  It helps you increase flexibility, It relaxes you, It builts lean muscle, It helps with your digestion. <br>  <br>  I like doing yoga. I started with a begginer CD then I stated increasing strenght. Tho I already do pilates But it was still difficult But after a while its very easy You will feel it in your legs a lot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.<br>  <br>  But it will make you look very good!!!!!!!|`|AA10732883	1.

People not always act the way you wish them to act. You may not be always able to be in control of external influences and conditions, but you can certainly learn to control your attitude and reactions. There is no sense of allowing circumstances and people to pull your strings and affect your mind and feelings. You can choose not to let what people say and do affect your moods. You can maintain an inner attitude of emotional and mental detachment, and refuse to allow every minor event play with your feelings and evoke anger. I often see people getting angry over unimportant and insignificant matters. Some insignificant remark or action, not getting a satisfactory reply to a question or just moodiness are enough to set fire and cause anger, snappy remarks, arguments and even physical fights. This is absolutely unnecessary. Life can be happier without this behavior. Anger is a negative reaction, and if you wish to progress on the path of self-improvement or spiritual growth you should avoid it as much as possible. Learning to calm down the restlessness of the mind and gaining peace of mind, is one of the best and most effective methods to overcome anger, and in fact, all negative emotions.If you are willing to invest the time and energy, you will reap great rewards. Peace of mind will not only help you overcome anger, but also help you overcome anxiety and negative thinking, and enable you to stay calm, tranquil and self possessed in difficult and trying situations.Peace of mind requires the development of an attitude of emotional and mental detachment, which is of vital importance for overcoming and avoiding anger. It protects you against being too affected by what people think, say or do, and is therefore highly recommended. Detachment is not an attitude of indifference and lack of sensitivity. It is an attitude of common sense and inner strength and leads to peace of mind.<br>  <br>  I suggest you a few simple tips for inner detachment and peace of mind, which will help you overcome anger:<br>  <br>  1. Devote a few minutes, at least once a day, to thinking on how much your life would be better without anger.<br>  <br>  2. When you feel anger arising in you, start breathing deeply and slowly several times.<br>  <br>  3. You may, instead of breathing deeply, or better still, in addition to it, count slowly from one to ten. This will delay your angry reaction and weaken it.<br>  <br>  4. Drinking some water has a calming effect on the body.<br>  <br>  5. Try to be more patient, no matter how difficult it might be.<br>  <br>  6. Be more tolerant toward people, even toward people you don't like.<br>  <br>  7. Everyone is entitled to his/her opinion. You can disagree with people, but still maintain tact and diplomacy.<br>  <br>  8. Choose to react calmly and peacefully in every situation. Try again and again, regardless of how many times you lose control and get angry.<br>  <br>  9. Positive thinking makes it easier to disregard remarks and behavior that otherwise could cause anger.<br>  <br>  10. Try to manifest at least some self-control, self-discipline and more common sense.<br>  <br>  11. Don't take everything too seriously. It is not worth it.<br>  <br>  12. Find reasons to laugh more often.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps you;)=)|`|yj3GT7jOaa	watch cartoons. The real ones; not Spngebob or Dora.  Try Bugs Bunny or Daffy Duck.  Tom and Jerry is good.

a5MzSF5qaa	Nah, you should be fine. They're not really confronting animals. If a pack gets close make a lot of noise, if it's dark (they have the advantage then) make a fire of some sort. If they get reallly close, show that you are not afraid of them. Get a big stick and do a mock charge. They'll usually steer clear of something that seems like a hard target. Keep in mind coyotes could carry rabies. A coyote with rabies will attack at random, because he basically has no fear and it could spread the virus to you. <br>  Stay away from them as far as possible, you may be bigger, but they outnumber you. On your own you do make a good target for a pack, and if you do get attacked nobody will be able to help you. If you can, take a firearm with you (don't break any laws). <br>  Hope this makes sense|`|jaGU3zyyaa	You never know what a wild animal will do and if they attack you, they will win because you will be outnumbered.  To be safe, just stay away from that field.|`|cilYUWgtaa	Attacks on humans are rare, but these are wild animals, so stay alert Pretty much, humans aren't on their menu, they mainly eat small animals (rabbits, mice, cats, etc). They are much more likely to attack a small child than an adult. If you're ever followed by a coyote, make loud noises and throw rocks at it.|`|rMk4jKNBaa	Coyotes are usually very shy animals. I live in a small town and there are a lot of coyotes. In my town, nearly every night, a coyote will get a chicken, or a cat, but I have only actually seen a coyote maybe 3 times in the 23 years I have lived here. I wouldn't worry about it if I were you. If you have any animals though, make sure they are safe at night.

X6W8MSAvaa	have you participated in giving oral sex lately?
mqXyDTwwaa	Neither one. You want to lift about 8 to 10 reps per set. What this means is you want to lift a weight that's heavy enough so that you can give it every thing you got, and you can just barely manage to do 8 reps, but not 9. Or 9 reps but not 10, or 10 reps but not 11. If you can do 11, then you need a heavier weight. Increase your weight until you can ONLY do 8 or so, and no more. When you increase your strength, and you start to do more reps, increase the weight. You should never just pick a weight, and do 10 reps and stop. You lift until you can't lift anymore.<br>  <br>  Now that we've got that straight, your workout should look more like this:<br>  <br>  Set 1: 50 lbs x 10 reps<br>  Set 2: 40 lbs x 10 reps<br>  Set 3: 30 lbs x 10 reps<br>  <br>  If you can do 10 reps with 50 lbs on the first set, then 10 reps with 50 lbs on the second set, you're resting too much between sets.<br>  <br>  Like you said, this is just an example.

You'll probably get a heavy painkiller, too.<br>  Now, it's easy to get addicted to painkillers, so I tried to stop taking them as soon as I could. They say only take one every four hours, right? Now pay attention. You want to be totally doped for at least four days. <br>  Four hours after you take the pill, you will still be ok. You will think 'this doesn't hurt, I won't take another one yet.' <br>  THIS IS BAD. The pills take at least an hour to kick in, meaning that by the time it starts hurting (5 hours or so) you want to have the next pill already down the hatch. Otherwise you'll have to endure the pain for an hour before relief comes. And to make it worse, you have to take the pill with FOOD. So you must CHEW whilst in pain. <br>  Trust me, take one every four hours for the first four days, and then start taking something less heavy-duty. <br>  Oh, and don't mess with your stitches.

mIfT5NRPaa	The same thing has been going on with me for 2 years. It started when I was 21 and now I'm 23 and I live in fear, paranoia, anxiety, repression, and all sorts of misery. Everyone responds and criticizes my thoughts indirectly so I'm always trying to find ways to work with them, around them, away from them or to override them. I think this constant thought broadcasting could be fixed in the psyche with something like devotion to mediation. <br>  Try the link below, a bunch of us have been talking about thought broadcasting for awhile on that message board.
cSBZQfaIaa	The simplest way to describe the difference between a psychologist and a psychiatrist is that a psychologist primarily aids the depressed patient by counseling and psychotherapy. A psychiatrist may also perform psychotherapy; but, in addition, can prescribe medications and perform ECT (electroconvulsive therapy). A psychiatrist is a medical doctor.

tkDfqjQdaa	I am currently having great results from using Sam-e and TMG in combination.  You can find both of them on Vitamin Shoppe website.  I take 200mg of Sam-e twice a day and 500mg TMG twice a day.  I also find that regular exercise (3-5 times per week) helps as well as avoiding sugar.

2stBV6XBaa	I would follow your doctor's advice.  Some people don't need them just for walking around or everyday tasks, but need them for things like reading, computer work or driving.  Some of us need them all the time or we'd walk into the broad side of a bright red barn.<br>  <br>  Wear them when you need them if your doctor says you don't need them all the time.  You'll know when you need them.  If you can't see or read something that you're trying to, and you can see or read it with the glasses, then you need them for that.  Your sister, for instance, really does need to wear them if she can't see the TV clearly.<br>  <br>  Whether or not your eyes get worse without them, I'm not sure.  I don't really know if that's an old wives' tale or not.  You can get eyestrain though if you're not wearing them when you need them.  That can cause eye pain and headaches.  Not fun.|`|ZA18KoC9aa	Its personal choice- if your eyesight is good enough to manage without them you don't need to wear them all the time. If you are shortsighted (can't see far away) you should take your glasses off when you do near work like reading, writing etc- this stops your eyes from getting worse as it reduces the amount of eyestrain.|`|2741fde46711a1ff2d147a001460f6c9aa	I'm pretty sure you're supposed to wear them if you have them. If you can't see close up then wear them when you're doing something that requires you to use your vision at a close range, same for far away. Unless you're vision is bad all the time, then you should wear them all the time =]<br>  <br>  I used to wear to glasses, but I stopped because I thought they looked stupid on me and my eyes got better for a while (weird I know). Then they got worse again and now I have to wear glasses, again! It's painful if I don't wear them, so I just do. It's not so bad once you get used to it. Plus I can't see far away if I dont =/|`|t5T8urrtaa	Well depends on how bad your sight is<br>  my doctor told me to only wear them when I read or watch tv but I never wear mine and I had them for years lol<br>  But I cant read whats on the tv guide when I look at the tv...its so blurry and when I put my glasses on it helps...so try to wear them when necessary...your regret it when your older

d456069f8e03a8bf7a79de76c7e45228aa	Yes. The problem is that medically weed or drugs or alcohol can or might interfere with the chemotherapy drugs themselves and make them less potent. It is critical that you discuss this with your oncologist . . you do not know how your body will react with the drugs and with chemotherapy . . it may make the chemo weaker, it may damage organs in your body . . no one knows. Another problem would be that when you have been in chemotherapy treatment your immune system is not functioning normally . . so you are more susceptible to infections . . when you smoke weed you do not know if there is any bacteria in the pot, or allergens and in a weakened condition brought on by chemo treatment you could end up with a life threatening situation. Alcohol and other drugs can also lower your immune system . . so you will need to co-ordinate any of this with your oncologist, be honest with them . . mention your plans . . and see if they feel it is not a wise thing to do while undergoing chemotherapy or any cancer treatments. It may make you sicker.|`|7eb3fd3226605d4f11ad285a2b5a5ab4aa	Any other drugs, including nicotine, alcohol, weed etc could all interact with your chemotherapy.<br>  <br>  Even herbal remedies can.<br>  <br>  Do not take anything without discussing with your oncologist first.<br>  <br>  I found out that high doses of some vitamins could interact with mine.<br>  <br>  Different forms of Chemotherapy react with different things.  Don't put your treatment regime at risk by taking stuff without your oncologist knowing about it.
ai33g11Maa	Yes, of course it will have a detrimental affect on your chemo if you do these things.  You only get so many shots at it, so you need to cut out the crap if you really want to give things a go. <br>  <br>  I can't believe you would think you could do drugs whilst having chemo.  Sure you can have the odd drink but DRUGS cannot be good for you whilst your body is so weak after chemo. Please look after your body.|`|cASB8Sh3aa	Alcohol and chemo is a bad mix.  Many chemo drugs can effect the liver and make it not work as well so drinking can cause liver failure.  You should try to quit smoking as their are cancer causing agents in cigs. As far as other drugs, weed typically will not effect the chemo process but it is illegal and your doctor may refuse to talk to you about the pros and cons of using it.  So really it's better to avoid all drugs while on chemo.  It gives your body a better chance of fighting.

You can keep cutting little slits in your body...WHY do you hate yourself so much?  You can keep whittling away pieces of your body until those pieces aren't good enough anymore, so you will cut a little deeper and make the cut a little longer...maybe you can even sever some nerves so that you can never feel that area again?  Wouldn't that be great?  Maybe get a staph infection that lands you in the hosptial with permanent damage to your body, if you live. Is your tummy sore because of your cuts?  How did your mom find out about the carving you have been doing on yourself, since you obviously cut youself in places that are not visible to others?  Let this excessive worrying go!  Get some help, be truthful to the doctor, accept the help and resign yourself to getting well.  This is not healthy behavior nor is is healthy behavior.  Get yourself well again!

I've been self mutilating for about 19 years and i'm only 24 don't go down the same road i'm on, it is something you'll regret for the rest of your life if you do.  Just get the help you need!!! And don't hide from it. Good luck i'll keep my fingers crossed for you.

The higher the amount of protein, the more muscle gain you will have.<br>  <br>  Take the supplement within 30 minutes of finishing your weights session.|`|uXP1Xij4aa	drink protein shake only after workout<br>  you need to supply most protein from real food, if you drink protein shakes too often you will not get maximum results.<br>  <br>  optimum nutrition 100% whey is not the best one, it's only very popular because it's cheap and tastes good, and has a good marketing department behind it.<br>  The truth is, there is no best protein because many are good for different reasons. So the best way is to try different brands, this way your body will not get used to the same one decreasing it's effect. <br>  Also by changing brands every month you will be safer from developing food intolerance.<br>  For best results try protein from different sources every month, for example from egg, whey and beef.<br>  Try any brand you want, but change them every month. That's the best way.|`|CI86Xtmraa	use just natural stuff, get away from artificial crap as will not work<br>  hope this helps|`|GL920Xv5aa	Optimum Nutrition... umm wake up in the morning, before and after workout and bed time

The only way they can tell for sure is a mammogram and a biopsy.|`|AA12066269	Breast size does not affect your chances for getting cancer.  If you have a lump or bump, you should ask your doctor about it.  It could be a cyst, which can cause discomfort but isn't cancerous.  It is always better to put your mind at ease and get it checked.|`|dkx0CCWGaa	Well first thing cancer of the breasts is normally indicated by a hard painless lump. Also it sometimes can be a result of your genes so u might wanna ask around if anyone in your family has ever had breast cancer. I would go see a doctor if it worries you that much.

And I really hope u know all about PCT and support supplements, if u dont then get it out of ur mind.|`|7fQLO6gZaa	It's very good that you want to loose weight, most people don't even care. Personally, I find the second picture absolutely revolting. It might take 4-6 months, but that is just an estimate. Eating healthy, fruit, veggies, AND meat will be good, and working out every weeknight or something would be good. Go for a light jog every night just around the neighborhood or something. Get a friend or someone to jog with you. This guy's body is a little more preferable than vanes sticking out all over the place all up and down the yin yang. Hope I helped, and good luck!!
mqXyDTwwaa	People actually used to do this, seriously. In the late 1800's and early 1900's, a popular circus exhibition was the half man/half woman. Mostly it was just a man wearing half a dress sewn to half a suit, with a beard grown on one side, and shaved with makeup on the other. But some performers did actually try to feminize one side and masculinize the other. This included exercising one side of the body to make it bigger and more muscular than the other.|`|HzkDjDpyaa	What a fantastic question.

Tm242Mfuaa	Ok...First off, to the person above....I HIGHLY doubt it's scoliosis...No prominent symptoms are present as far as we know, so don't give completely incorrect diagnoses if you obviously have no idea what scoliosis even is.<br>  <br>  Now...I don't think that chewing ice has anything to do with the pain in your knees or the dots on your back. The knee pain may be associate with a problem with your bones or can be a muscular problem as well. I would recommend seeing a doctor to see what they think. As for the black dots, I personally have no idea what they could be (the fact that they are crispy throws me off a little)...But I'm sure they are simply bruises since you haven't said that you've had back pain associated with any of this...But when you go to the doctor you can ask them to look at those too.<br>  <br>  I hope this goes away soon for you!|`|e5f0c993dc43986b75d483b1ea872bc2aa	You could have just bruised your back.  The bones do stick out and if you fell on your back or you were lying down on something hard it could have gotten hurt.  Show your mom or someone.  If you messed up your knees skateboarding or whatever boys do than they may be week.  If they hurt than you really need to see the doctor to make sure you haven't damaged them.  Chewing ice will put cracks in your teeth.  Don't chew the ice.|`|Jusnu14oaa	u gotta be a flexible uthafucka to see yo damn back u crazy get that checkout u mite have scoliolisis|`|40zewEkMaa	I doubt chewing ice or your knees have anything to do with these dots.  If you're worried about it, then talk to your parents and make an appointment with your doctor.
okTecGZfaa	Sucking on peppermint candy or brewing some peppermint tea is great for an upset stomach...and as unpleasant as it sounds, sometimes it's better to just let nature take its course.|`|cszrEWuWaa	Take deep calming breaths (in via nose, out via mouth), take small sips of cold water frequently, and tell yourself that you won't be sick. If these don't work, take an anti-sickness tablet if possible. If all else fails, just let yourself be sick, it's obviously not pleasant but you may feel better after it.|`|EDjCLWccaa	A flat coke that is room temp. will help. There is also a pressure point on the inside of wrist, about two fingers down. Put a little pressure on it and it should go away.|`|vqVvpiZiaa	PEPTO!!!|`|PRzmwFfgaa	Peppermint tea but in your case (McDonalds) probably just some Pepto will do.

Is that 17 grams within the guidelines of your daily allowable intake? And second Are you going to be up for quite a bit longer.  Most of those watching their carbohydrate intake especially avoid them in the evenings. That is because their activity level is lower.|`|RGJhva7Daa	Not the healthiest snack.

You need to be able to use your imagination; show compassion, consideration, passion and feelings for your partner.  Practice makes perfect and performance can be improved upon but, the fact is, how well you are endowed means nothing.

jlHz0Fg1aa	Some people show symptoms of things.<br>  This doesn't mean they have them.  It doesnt even mean they actually have anything, at all.<br>  If you sneeze, do you automatically assume you have a cold? Or could it be allergies? Or just a tiny particle that irritated your nose, which is the most reasonable explanation.<br>  <br>  People need to stop blaming their idiosyncracies, quirks, and odd habits by labelling them as mental illnesses like ADD, OCD, and Asperger's.|`|ParFJxnSaa	Like many disorders, it differs in its expression, and severity. Those with normal or high intelligence can learn the interpretation of social cues, and behaviour appropriate to certain circumstances.<br>  <br>  Such techniques enable greater assimilation into the mainstream, which can help with the depression that often goes along with social isolation of sufferers.

I think every child should have an overall assessment for neurological differences and as has been said up to 40% of all children have to some degree, and then work with there strengths and weaknesses, the word low functioning sounds sub human to me and do not know anyone who likes to use the word, I also feel the word special education has out lived its day, the stigma with being within the special needs system is huge. I feel everyone with neurological differences should just be classed as differently able and get support where needed.<br>  <br>  Even high functioning (another unnecessary label I feel) children need support, but still not recognized enough...  As for calling children gifted please, its like saying your child is better than the next, to me all children are a gift and all have a place, but many especially from poorer families just get lost in the system, its like throwing the injured to the wolf pack at times, why it continues in this day and age amazes me. It is about time everyone got behind the next generation of children, communities as every child has a right to an education, does not happen and some barely survive school. It amazes me that many of the so called do good groups often only support "nice families" too many rules, and those in real need so often no one seems to have the time for. Of course there are some great programs and inspirational people who really do help, but not enough. Still I guess the existing school system does not suit many children and for real change the whole system needs to be looked at if you ask me!

As long as the family and individual are willing to recognize that these additional supports will be needed and are willing to ask for help, why bother to rate the severity?

84821087cda14dd0bdf6bd3bbda14952aa	Any piercing or tattoo damage the body by interrupting the way energy flows through the body.  This is called an "interference field."  The Chinese have studied energy and how to manipulate it with things like acupuncture.  The acupuncture meridians are where the "flows" cross over or join in a particular area on the body.  There are 1,000's of these meridians around the body.  Recently, experiments in quantum physics as showed us that each cell in our body emits light.  The JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association) verified that experiments showed that the mitochondria in our cells emits light.  It is this light frequencies that circulate around the body and allow the cells to communicate with each other.  <br>  <br>  Piercings, traumas, injuries, tattoos, etc., all cause these interference fields and this definitely affects your health in ways you would never suspect or make the connection that the interference fields are causing health problems.  <br>  <br>  As an example, any injury, piercing, etc. can affect the parietal cells in your stomach and cause you to not utilize your stomach acid well and you will get digestive problems.  Until you correct the interference fields, they will cause these problems till the day you die.<br>  <br>  Just because you get some satisfaction from the way they look, should NOT be a reason to get them, because your health is far more important.<br>  <br>  good luck to you|`|DWeGV8Akaa	hey i guess no problem but take it off when we do it ... it might get in the way ... ;)|`|vwvTldkoaa	i think it would hurt pretty bad.<br>  but you dont have to be a "type" of person<br>  to get a nipple piercing.|`|xijwHZrWaa	Hahahaha it makes me laugh, in a good way though.|`|JfrBedpJaa	i dont think they are really apropriate|`|xXIXVNEfaa	woah weird|`|le75Ep5Qaa	Im a guy, and I want one too!

0lCnu1g2aa	she may have a cyst or abcess there. Tell her to keep area clean and dry. She could also apply A & D ointment or neosporin if she can to area. But she sure does need to see the dr.|`|O3YQJOFjaa	It could simply be that she has dry skin.  Many people, when they have dry skin, their skin breaks/cracks - it is more likely to happen when the skin has folds or seams, such as under the breast, in the groin, behind the knee, behind the ear and the armpit area.  It is also possible that she sat somewhere/somehow in a way that pulled the skin until it split.<br>  <br>  No that the skin is cracked, she could try putting some antibiotic ointment on it until it heals.  After that, she should put some extra moisturizer in the area.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	using talcum instead of washing daily is your sister's problem.  If she gets some zinc oxide ointment, like Desitin, it will likely clear it up, but she needs to wash it off thoroughly and reapply every day.
CYp8QkJKaa	I think it can be really easy to get 'stuck' on someone. The best thing you can do is separate fact from fiction. Do you really know him as a person or are you thinking that he is a certain way when you really don't know? It'll make you aware. It might not feel like it right now but you'll get over him. You'll most likely meet someone who is a lot more suited for you.|`|a5MzSF5qaa	You'll be fine sweetie. Some just take longer.

RnGlzo4Raa	Don't loose anymore then 2lbs per week any faster then that could leave you left with saggy skin and easier to pile back on the pounds. I agree loose about 10 then see how you feel looking in the mirror. Do not let yourself get to extremes with stupid eating habits though. Eat sensibly don't try to shed it all in a flash|`|EDO0IMkGaa	dont loose more then 2 or 3 to 4 pounds a week you dont want to end up with saggy skin also your in a good weight rage also and if your worried about what people are saying that you look fat or stuff like that tell them to go **** there self and just becuase your chubby doesn't mean your healthy trust me you might wana stay like that now and just exercise 2 a week not to much becuase then you would look ugly when you grow up and then you would be fine and sometimes well most of the time chubby girls are more healthy than skinny girls or thick girls and remember just feel good about yourself dont let this get you down and just live your life: )|`|wxzeKh4Iaa	Start on a workout program and healthy diet and you won't have to worry about a specific weight loss number.
W6LGsQC8aa	I have had acne all my life, so I feel for you. Unfortunately the only thing that ever really helped my acne was going on Acutane (the hard core acne medication you take orally).<br>  <br>  My advice is to see a dermatologist so they can recommend products that work for your unique skin type. It could be your face is too oily, too dry, or some combination of both.<br>  <br>  The best tip I have is try to keep your hands OFF your face! That is the quickest way to break out is touch your face. Just get into a daily cleanser/toner/moisturizer routine.|`|c20207b79edb6a1d68e27d7750bd7d9caa	im is the same boat! so i finally went to the dermatologist. she put me on antibiotics and this foam that you rub on your acne twice a day. I have been on it about 3 or so weeks now, I've seen a little improvement. she said it would take 3 months to work..... so yeah go to a dermatologist.....|`|HwUfcYsAaa	Soap: Cetaphil, you can pick it up anywhere.  I also got Differin from my dr and it worked great.  I didn't have serious acne, so this was just right.  Other products like Retna were to harsh and ate my skin!!
5ulr9xLQaa	You may have an inner ear problem.  The inner ear controls your equilibrium.  You may also have an iron deficiency.   Tell your parents and go see a doctor.|`|PRzmwFfgaa	Sounds like there is a problem with your equilibrium but you should see a doctor because it could be something more serious and your doctor would want to run some tests to rule those things out.|`|40zewEkMaa	A lot of times, when people sit up or stand up really fast, they get dizzy.  It's usually not anything to worry about, and normally occurs due to a slow heart rate from inactivity for a period of time.  It can also occur when you have a decrease in blood flow to your brain for a short period of time.  Feeling lightheaded or the room going black for a brief time happens to a lot of people, so you shouldn't sweat it.<br>  <br>  If you get dizzy for a long period of time after standing up or if your dizziness occurs everytime you change position, then I'd consult your doctor or talk to your mom.
OpBfhALOaa	i think I was around that when I was your age. I was really tall too, but I think i was only around 5'5' at that point... well, maybe like 5'7'... I don't know, but I got people saying that stuff too. You are perfectly normal I think! I know that people say the whole BMI thing, but I think that sometimes we can't really judge by how skinny we are, but more as to why we're skinny... Idk but I think that if you are eating like three healthy meals a day, working out in a good way, and just ya know being healthy in general that there is nothing wrong with you! =) Keep up the sports and stuff because that will help you sooo much in high school! Now, I'm sixteen and I'm 6'2' and 170, so I think that a lot of people balance out... or in my opinion for myself tip over to the opposite side, so like I said just keep doing what you're doing and don't let others get to you because if being too skinny is the flaw they chose then you must be too pretty for them! Lol! jk! but really I think you're fine! =) good luck!|`|m7JM1ntbaa	woah.<br>  5'7?<br>  13?<br>  you are quite underweight for your height.<br>  if you want to be a little bigger than eat a lot more.<br>  but if you want to stay the way you are then you cann :)|`|XZqSO94saa	You're quite underweight.<br>  I would talk to you're doctor about it if you're really concerned, and if you have'nt recieved you're cycle.|`|Sn4tDqeCaa	best thing to do is check your BMI (Body Mass Index)<br>  just google it- it's free.
VHuENOonaa	Water is not a cause of dizziness. You are most likely consistently dehydrated. When you are dehydrated, adding fluids is going to get you a little dizzy because you are adding them back in your body. Try some gaterade water (g2) and water so you have enough electroylites so you dont get dehydrated|`|XQGm3lfPaa	i personally think its because your body has never had water and then you just give it to it.

Gw1LLzDgaa	Get over the guilt, there is no reason for it.  I am sorry that you are not being permitted to grow up normally, I consider it very sad -- but I understand that you have no choice.<br>  <br>  Masturbation is normal and healthy (even decreasing the risk of prostate cancer).  I will not comment on what I think of the type of religion that will tell a teenage boy otherwise.  I will say that on this particular issue -- I believe them to be completely wrong.  If there is a deity -- any deity -- whether Christ or any other -- then that deity does not care.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  <br>  Hermes|`|2ydF6OTAaa	I don't you can decrease the libido on your own. Occassional masturbation can be healthy, however, if you are missing out on social outings to stay and home and masturbate, then something is most definitely wrong. How about finding a friend to hang out with, or hanging out at a coffee shop.|`|057SUuSYaa	You're a healthy 14 year old boy.  This is so, "normal", comedians make a living tell jokes on this very subject.<br>  <br>  But if you must stop, you first need to cut down.<br>  Go from 3 times a day to, two times a day.  Do that for a year then drop it to once a day.<br>  <br>  It's all about baby steps.  God will understand.|`|EDjCLWccaa	There is no household thing that will do the trick. You are 14 and you need remember that it is hormonal. You are feeling exactly what you should be at that age. Raising four boys and being in the medical field I assure you that you are perfectly normal. I understand the whole religion thing but I also think religion does not address what kids go through during these years. You are doing what most kids do at that age, male and female. It is not dirty or gross. It is private and natural so accept that what you are going through is all part of growing up. Do not try anything to stop it as you can hurt yourself. Do NOT use household products. <br>  This is all part of growing up kiddo..... good luck

UBdt4Wm0aa	Get a new doctor. There are other treatments that won't ruin your sex life! If your doctor isn't taking it seriously, I think a new doctor is in order!|`|UUtTDAJraa	The first thing you need to do is figure out why your sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|U9R005b1aa	Hard to believe, but birth control can actually reduce your sex drive.  See if your doctor could put your on something else that could help your endometriosis.  There are also  female enhancements that you can purchase over the counter such as pills, gels or creams.

tkDfqjQdaa	Real homemade chicken soup (made with chicken stock simmered for at least 8 hours with 2 tablepoons of raw apple cider vinegar, chicken skin, bones and feet if you can get them) add tons of onion, garlic and cayenne pepper. What I do is make the stock periodically and freeze it so I have it when anyone gets sick.

Garlic is a natural antibiotic and will knock out any cold in 24 hours.<br>  <br>  Put one clove of garlic into a zip loc bag and then crush with a spoon or glass. Toast some bread and butter it, then put the garlic on the bread and eat it.

If it gets worse go see the doctor. Keep the area clean and dry. Don't cover it with a bandage. You might try putting some Neosporin ointment on it. Definitely don't scratch it! Just watch it and make sure it's getting better. And like I said, if it gets worse, go see your doc. Take care!|`|6PhSENcXaa	It's possible when you put those pants on you got bit by the spider.

0udgkOTPaa	There are many people in the world who have a simian crease on one or both of their hands.  A "syndrome" is a combination of many things together. Not just one symptom. <br>  <br>  Although it is possible that you could have a rarer form of Down syndrome called mosaic Down syndrome that often goes undetected, it is unlikely that you have this. You would probably have a lot more symptoms such as speech delays or some learning delays or some health problems that are more than just regular teenage sicknesses.<br>  <br>  Please remember that people with Down syndrome are very intelligent. They may just talk funny, but that doesn't mean that they are dumb. It just means that they have trouble getting their words out. <br>  <br>  People with mosaic Down syndrome sometimes do not have the same speech problems as someone with Down syndrome, and they usually don't have the physical characteristics (what they look like) as someone with Down syndrome. So, many of these people live their whole lives without knowing about. <br>  <br>  Don't worry about your classmates. They just laughed because they didn't know what else to do! I am sure they have already forgotten all about this and if they haven't show them your lines and show them how cool and unique you are! After all.... not everyone gets to have simian lines in both their hands!|`|pa7rzc8Qaa	My brother was born with one of those lines, and he has no sign whatsoever of Down's. He is now 30 and has proved to be very intelligent and has never had any major health issues (other than appendicitis when he was like 12, which has no relation to Down's anyway). If you had Down's, I'm sure it would've been diagnosed when you were a baby or young child.|`|s5HKQlHxaa	well if you say that u are intelligent then u obvioulsy dont have down syndrome....those markings on the hand probably means something else|`|jcGeCJnOaa	First of all, your teacher is a idiot. <br>  <br>  Yes, Downs syndrome is genetic, but is the result of having and extra gene (47 instead of the normal 46). This can cause an number of physical characteristics. There can be various physical characteristics associated with Downs Syndrome depending upon the amount and type of genetic information on that extra gene. <br>  <br>  For your teacher to link one specific physical physical characteristic with Downs Syndrome is beyond irresponsible. That would be like saying people with attached ear lobes are smarter than people with unattached ear lobes. <br>  <br>  Downs Syndrome is a serious disorder, but many (not all) children that have it can live happy and productive lives. If you had Downs Syndrome it would have been detected before you were born. <br>  <br>  You should be afraid however. Not about having Downs Syndrome, but about narrow minded imbeciles making judgments about your intelligence and character based solely on the lines on your hands. <br>  <br>  Here are somethings to consider; Stephen Hawkins is confined to a wheelchair due to a genetic mutation that causes progressive nerve deterioration. Ludwig Von Beethoven was deaf (yes it's true) and if Claude Monet were alive today he would be considered legally blind.|`|ktbRE826aa	trust me, if u had down syndrome u'd know it lol|`|0e27a736d12fa17e74fd3387bd95aa93aa	Sorry, I did not read all of that but your fears can be laid to rest with 100% certainty by a blood test.<br>  <br>  But know THIS....what you are capable of today or yesterday...you will be capable of tomorrow.

1FVthgU9aa	I'd recommend you look at one of the many height/weight charts available online. I just checked one at the link listed below and the healthy weight for a 5'-4" woman ranges from 124-138 for a medium-framed person. Even if you are a small-framed person, 105-110 lbs is maybe a little low.100 lbs would definitely be TOO low.  If your weight & body image really worry you, talk to someone about it. I know it's all too easy to self-critique, and everyone is always their own worst critic, but talking puts things in perspective. Trust me, agonizing over your weight is only going to lead to anxiety, trouble, and possibly health problems so try not to go there.|`|XULDCXLhaa	and im sure you are skin and bones. if everyone is telling you are skinny and you are biased then you might have a problem. my sister was the same and she was balemick. its all in your head and its a serious problem. illusions. im sure you look great so id get over it and maybe get help before you get to worse.If you had like 10 more lbs on you id probably say youd look perfect!|`|7fQLO6gZaa	Hun, you're not fat at all.

You need to eat 5 times per day, 3 small meals and 2 healthy snacks to keep your blood sugar in balance and this will keep the weight off and help you build healthy muscles.<br>  <br>  Also, it depends on what you are eating for your 2 meals - lots of fruits and veggies, lean protein and whole grains? All these foods help keep your weight down in a healthy way.<br>  <br>  If you are seeing yourself as fat and others see you as anorexic then don't dismiss what they are saying to you. Do you have a counselor or someone you can talk to about this? Perhaps your family doctor?|`|d2yhgGU6aa	I think that at 13 years old, this is the last thing you should be worrying about.|`|lW2d7m9Baa	u sound a little full of yourself asking this..
2stBV6XBaa	While it's not ideal, sleeping in them for one night is not going to ruin your eyes.  I've had to do it more than once, and I can still see.  If you do have to sleep in them, when you wake up your eyes will be very dry.  Do not attempt to move the lens around to loosen it up.  You will have to let your eye naturally lubricate them.  If you try to move them around when they are dry and sort stuck to your eye, you run the risk of scratching your cornea.  If you have access to re-wetting drops, you can put those in when you get up to help re-moisten your eyes.<br>  <br>  And don't use water on them.|`|AA11307873	Whatever you do, don't use regular water.  It can put bacteria into the lenses which would then transfer to your eye.<br>  <br>  If you have artificial tears you could use those or a re-wetting drop.  Just make sure the eye drops are not the kind that "get the red out".  You shouldn't use those for a soaking solution.<br>  <br>  If you have to sleep in them, I wouldn't sleep more than 2 hours without putting some drops in to keep everything lubricated and allow some oxygen to get to the tear layer of the eyes.|`|iWKn0wSiaa	DO NOT USE WATER! The bacteria in water can really hurt your eyes. Call your optician and explain your situation and see if they can help you. I can get my solution at any regular grocery store so if someone could run to the store for you, you'd have your solution in no time. Good luck!|`|AA11271703	Just take a trip down to the nearest place selling saline solution. <br>  It's not the most convenient solution, but the safest and most hygienic.|`|BextORpbaa	Sleep with them and you can moisturize with your own saliva. <br>  Disgusting but true...|`|1cPB2NYfaa	Don't sleep with them! contact lenses will give you chlamydia<br>  <br>  No I'm joking make your own saline solution with boiling water and a 1/4 spoon full of salt.|`|3DI0ZJS5aa	You will have to improvise a bit, wash your hands first. Since your cleaning method will not be ideal, you need to make sure to eliminate absolutely every other opportunity for irritants to get into your eyes. Wash your hands in warm soapy water for at least 30 seconds, and rinse them well.<br>  <br>  Take out your contacts. Once you remove your contacts, you can either place them in your contact holder if you have that available, or use your clean hand to hold them. <br>  <br>  Pour water into one of your hands and rub your contact around in the water. Water can work as a temporary cleaning agent. If you have purified water, or bottled water, however, it works best. You don't want mineral deposits on your contacts if you can avoid it. <br>  <br>  Use saline solution to clean your contacts. Saline solution is another option for those caught without contact cleaning solution. Back in the old days, saline solution was used to clean contacts. Simply use it like you would regular contact solution. <br>  <br>  Squirt some Visine in your hands and wash your contacts with it. Visine is another temporary cleaning agent for contacts. It is typically used to calm irritated eyes, so it should not bother your eyes once you put your contacts back in.|`|b1xQKDEraa	do not use water as it can ruin the contacts and is not good for your eye. You will either need to keep them in and sleep in them (which i have done before by mistake). It wont hurt you if you do it once, all it means is that when you wake up, wait 10 minutes before taking them out. Your eyes are dry in the morning and taking them out too soon can damage the eye. Get some solution from the local supermarket or late night chemist. or try a drop in centre, they have spare supplies.

Rq67UTVcaa	I did this last year.  Had 17 teeth pulled and temporaries put in. Expect pain for about two weeks. Stock up on yogurt and healthy soft foods.  I lost 47 pounds after having my bad teeth pulled.  The temporaries should be used for about 6 months as that is how long it takes for your gums to heal.  Now I still wear my temps as I can't afford to get the permanent ones.  I haven't found a good glue that works so ask your dentist what he recommends.  I also bought a babies tooth brush to clean my mouth out.  An adult toothbrush is too harsh.|`|dfe6c334e9209f452ad6c98b5a766df3aa	well i was wondering why you are getting temp. dentures, but anyways, they will pull the remaining teeth and put in dissolve-able stitches if necessary and then put the denture right in. and you won't be able to take it out for like a week i think or close to it. so it will be uncomfortable but it's necessary. take your pain pills and keep ice going for the first day 20 mins on and 20 mins off and after the first day do heat, like a hot water bottle or even a hot cloth. moist heat is best. 20 mins on and 20 mins off. good luck! :)

fX6YkpYSaa	My degree is in anthropology, not anything medical, but I do alot of reading on health and see some things here that you may want to research further.<br>  <br>  1. The excessive bleeding.<br>  Alcohol acts as a blood thinner. People that drink heavily, can have prolonged bleeding when they have wounds. Also, aspirin is a blood thinner, and many times given to individuals with heart problems/cardiovascular trouble.  So, the drinking of the alcohol may contribute to this. If you add that to alot of aspirin, then bleeding will be worse. Naturally, I would suggest she lighten up on the drinking rather than stopping to take the aspirin. She may need the aspirin if there are other problems like I mentioned earlier. <br>  <br>  If she won't slow down on alcohol, you may want to have her eat leafy green vegetables such as spinach etc... Basically, anything with heavy VITAMIN K.  So, try to give her foods high in vitamin K to counter the alcohol/aspirin mix,if she can't change the alcohol consumption. VITAMIN K helps blood coagulation and may slow down the bleeding. ( I have a family member who must regulate blood thickness due to her illness, so I know this)<br>  <br>  2. SCABS<br>  It sounds like an immune deficiency problem.  Her weight is low and with the consistent drinking. Also, thinness of blood ( via alcohol, medicine or otherwise) and other factors can lowers your immune system.<br>  <br>  A. Give her a daily vitamin and have her eat healthy TO BOOST IMMUNE SYSTEM<br>  B. Did her doctor say she was negative for Herpes Zoster?  This is also related to your immune system.This site has pretty good pictures of it .It is from a viral infection.<br>  <a href="http://www.skinsite.com/info_herpes_zoster.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.skinsite.com/info_herpes_zost...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.aad.org/public/publications/pamphlets/viral_herpes_zoster.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aad.org/public/publications/p...</a><br>  C. A bacterial infection of the skin could do it- you may want to research bacterial infections too.<br>  <br>  Either way, while you figure out the problem, work on boosting her immune system and thickening her blood a bit with foods high in VIT.K.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|sm7DJGOoaa	take the beer from yo momma bitcch, and pick dem narsty asss scabs, and send that quief of tyo rehab!<br>  <br>  by the way, is yo mamma amy whinehouse?!<br>  and i bet you &+_ yo mamma ghetto as hell.|`|z2d5YvOeaa	Alcohol + Asprin...DUH!|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	drinking alcohol and taking aspirin, it's amazing she is still alive.

b56bc4b4812ffed0f195cc7beda1d557aa	La réponse dépend des réserves de chacun, en moyenne un mois sans séquelles, un peu plus pour les personnes en sur-poids. Je parle ici d'un je?ne sans aucun apport de quelques forme que ce soit.<br>  <br>  En buvant de l'eau minérale on doit pouvoir tenir quelques semaines supplémentaires.<br>  <br>  Avec une perfusion de sérum sous cutané environ trois mois.<br>  <br>  Avec une perfusion intraveineuse de composé nutritionnel on peut vivre plusieurs années.<br>  <br>  Cependant il y a des risques à faire je?ne complet. Les risques sont les suivants : dans un premier temps le manque d'apport énérgétique va mettre en oeuvre des mécanismes métaboliques visant à piocher dans les réserves (au bout de deux ou trois jours environ). Il va s'en suivre une fonte musculaire et donc une diminution de la mobilité (une semaine). La personne qui je?ne va donc se retrouver rapidement confinée au lit, elle va développer des complications liées à cet alitement : phébite, embolie pulmonaire, escarres, mycoses... Souvent ce n'est pas directement le manque nutritionnel qui tue mais les complications de l'alitement. Cette situation est relativement fréquente chez la personne agée.<br>  <br>  En conclusion, si c'est pour un projet de grève de la faim, mieux vaut abandonner tout de suite car c'est une situation désagréable potentiellement dangereuse.|`|05c363297378c4a039a35700594a9214aa	tu peux tenter l'expérience. surtout tient nous informer(si tu passes pas l'arme à gauche entre temps)|`|3ca4f6443fe344dd70db8a5bcf7a19b2aa	3 4 jours apres on commence a vraiment puiser dans tes reserves et tu ne peux tenir plus d'un mois|`|8d25337d9ec8862fee086601a1d46929aa	7 jours|`|9407ad262b606882704c60d2913b3a68aa	17 jours, j'étais très malade, je ne le conseille à personne.|`|bad8dd493d53181cd14d601dd60dd62daa	tape "le jeune selon Shelton", tu auras la réponse, mon bouquin fait 358 pages...alors !|`|69629441074dc615bb407470acfc480daa	;;;suivant les statistiques, 3 jours, mais il y a toujours des" cas "qui ne rentrent pas dans les statisiques.|`|2620a9ace1dbad18fd474573d3d75e0caa	4 jours c'est suffisant je crois ...|`|739c17019a05e40415719c34f5f78a3caa	Une des mes tantes a lu une livre sur les bénéfices pour la santé apportes par un long jeun- donc elle n'a pas mange 40 jours- continuant ses activités comme d'habitude.

a5MzSF5qaa	Well, there are a lot of causes. Headaches are tricky. The pain behind the eye is a symptom of cluster or migraine type headaches. Also, headaches lasting a long time means something you do/eat is continually causing them. Eye strain can cause headaches, but so can sleeping too much or too little or drinking coffee either in excess or stopping. Chocolate and aged cheeses even bananas and fresh baked bread (yes) can cause headaches. Look at your diet. How much caffeine do you consume each day? Do you consume the same amount every day? Do you smoke? Nicotine constricts veins and could cause headaches, and then when you quit or haven't had a smoke for a while the veins and arteries will dilate too far and cause another headache. Pain killers (usually prescription) offers relief for 4-8hrs but some of them can cause rebound headaches. You're a girl, so hormones also play a role (periods,ovulation,contraceptives).<br>  Make a diary of when the headache started and what you ate that day even the events that took place. Did your boss yell at you? Stress can cause a headache. Find the source and treat that, not just the symptom.<br>  Hope this helps|`|9rLTSGcAaa	Perhaps you have TMJ (a jaw problem)<br>  a lot of people who have bracess at some point get this and it causes pretty painful headaches<br>  I have it myself<br>  it may not be what you have but it could be a possibility|`|f6XwjtvPaa	you could probably get your period|`|CdTe8MO4aa	it could be a sinus headache<br>  <br>  Definition<br>  <br>  <br>  You're congested. You feel pressure around your eyes, cheeks and forehead. And your head is throbbing. It feels like a sinus headache — but don't jump to conclusions. <br>  <br>  Headaches often accompany sinusitis, a condition in which the membranes lining the sinuses become swollen and inflamed. But many people who assume they have sinus headaches actually have migraines or tension headaches. <br>  <br>  When headaches caused by sinusitis do occur, proper diagnosis and treatment are the keys to relief.

OUbNSXjJaa	You are young and you should now have proper self-control and develop such good habits now itself.<br>  <br>  To tackle anger problem, there are few suggestions. One is to isolate yourself. Go to a cool and calm place. Like garden, green lawn, sea beach, etc. Do not unduly exercise your mind at all for illegitimate causes. Think that you have no brain for a while. It is a kind of meditation.<br>  <br>  Second thing is, you should not get angry initially unless provoked. Control your mind. Slowly and steadily try.<br>  <br>  Third thing is, give a higher orientation or purpose for getting angry. I mean if you get angry to maintain overall discipline and orderliness, you will get support from unknown forces/sources.<br>  <br>  Fourth thing is know your position well, and do not try to get angry with elders, teachers, peers, mentors, priests, parents, etc.<br>  <br>  There is also a fifth method of directing the anger towards your own self, for not revealing the truth or reality.<br>  <br>  Sixth method is do not get angry for "selfish" reasons.<br>  <br>  You should know that we waste our energy unnecessarily by getting angry or irritated. Such energy can be usefully diverted and utilized for better achievements.|`|V4VGFyxlaa	Sweetie I'm sure there is nothing wrong with other than typical teenage emotions.

pquw7AdQaa	First try drinking water and wait 10minutes!<br>  If you're still hungry try eating a healthy snack like a fruit or sugar free jell-o<br>  There are lots of healthy and low calorie snack out there now!You just have to look for them!:)|`|N3xdqu7laa	I completely have the same problem.<br>  What I do, and I find this very effective, is when I feel like eating junk food or any food just because I'm bored is I'll drink water. A really good idea is to have two water bottles so one can be in the fridge at all times, and constantly have the other one with you. Keeping a water bottle with you at all times is great because when your body craves boredom food, instead of getting up to grab a glass of water and be tempted to grab something while you're in the kitchen, your body will automatically take a glug of water.<br>  This method is also really great because not only does water not have calories in it, it also helps weight loss and flushes toxins out of your system.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  What 'Casey M' says is also a really geat trick. Instead of having the pantry or fridge full of chocolate bars, chips and other junky snacks, stock up on apples, grapes, berries, muesli/nut bars, carrots, yoghurts and any fruits or vegetables you like, then, even when you do have boredom food, it will be a healthy snack instead of something fatty.|`|vwvTldkoaa	Im am going through the same thing.<br>  until i decided it was time for change. <br>  now, everyday, as soon as i get home<br>  i change my clothes and head outside<br>  for a walk. even though its winter time and very very cold, i just bundle up and once you get moving you warm up.|`|BJuyUnfDaa	i have the same problem this is what i do i have one snack and i tell myself no i really just eat and eat until i am full but i have one snack and that is it|`|pc1ua6wRaa	what I do is if I'm at home, I find a pic of a celebrity I'd love to look like (please don't choose an anorexic one...) and i tape it to the fridge or cabinet. Then, evertime you go to eat something you know is fattening and bad, or if you arent even hungry, you become more determined to lose weight. If you are at school, or someplace other than home, just think about the last time you looked in the mirror, and how this food will effect you. Last of all, just freeze and ask yourself if you're really actually hungry.<br>  Hope this helps you!|`|puYteyAxaa	The key for losing weight is not difficult - consume less and exercise more - the difficulties appear when we in reality try to put that into practice!

84821087cda14dd0bdf6bd3bbda14952aa	It sounds like you have a lymphatic problem due to poor digestion and an infection or parasites in your intestines and possibly your liver.  Allergies are mostly caused by a toxic colon.  Taking medications to treat the symptoms is "MAKE BELIEVE HEALTH" and this is what doctors typically do, is treat symptoms, NOT "root causes" of diseases.<br>  <br>  99% of ALL cancers are from infection(s) in the body.  It typically takes about 8 to 10 years to develop breast cancer, for example from infections ranging from the teeth due to bad dental work, intestines, due to toxic foods, chemicals, and poor nutrition.<br>  <br>  ALL drugs are toxic to the body and cause reactions and do NOT give you nutritive value.  Taking drugs, many times, extends the illness time and can slow down and even stop the natural healing the body is designed to do.  Yes, they can make you feel better, but always at a cost to your overall health.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you have a sinus problem based on taking the claritin and zyrtec.  A  toxic liver is the "root cause" of sinus problems, typically, but can also be due to bad dental work, like amalgam fillings, root canals done according the dentist's "standard of care."  <br>  <br>  It does not sound like cancer, but a toxic issue and a nutritional issue.  I suggest you see a Certified Nutritional Therapist that can help you find the "root cause" and then focus on becoming healthy.<br>  <br>  good luck to you|`|7eb3fd3226605d4f11ad285a2b5a5ab4aa	If you are needing to take clatitin and zyrtec, I'm guessing you have possibly had mucus running down the back of your throat?<br>  <br>  This could easily cause an infection involving both your tonsil and glands.<br>  <br>  See a Dr for an accurate diagnosis and treatment rather than relying on strangers on the internet, but I doubt this is anything serious.

Make sure you use ones with plastic applicators.<br>  <br>  If it hurts at all, you don't have the right size, or it's not far enough.<br>  <br>  I use tampax, slender regulars. They are for teens, and I use them even though I'm 21 because I have a small frame. I can't feel them at all, whereas before, I used just regular tampons, and I felt them somewhat.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Yes, the applicator goes in as well.<br>  <br>  When you take the tampon out of the box, it's inside the plastic applicator. Insert the applicator into the vagina, all the way until your fingers can push it in no farther. Then you push the tampon out of the applicator and it's in the vagina, and the applicator remains out of the body. The string of the tampon is the ony part you see, and you use that to take the tampon out when done using.<br>  <br>  If that was not clear, read the directions. They have pictures, and really help. Good luck.|`|YVasdve0aa	You may be a little dry.  Try putting some KY Jelly on the end of it and then inserting.  It makes it glide a little easier.  Once you get the hang of it and can relax a little you won't have to use it any more.  Also make sure you get the plastic applicator.  They go in easier.  With my first few times inserting it helped me to take a deep breath and then breath out while I was inserting.  Hope this helps.|`|TlqLncKsaa	The first time I used one, I felt like I was going to pass out! Just take a deep breath & go slow. I would also suggest using plastic applicator for the first time.|`|7oVCFgeiaa	I had the same problem the first time I tried using them, don't worry I think it's fairly normal and it just takes some getting used to. The first time I tried, I used Tampax Compaq (the yellow type) with a plastic applicator, and I have carried on using these as they are the easiest to insert and don't seem to pinch. Also if you relax it makes it a lot easier as the muscles wont be as tense. It is also important to remember that when you insert the tampon you should angle it towards your lower back rather than aiming it straight upwards as this will hurt ALOT! And yes ... you do insert the applicator but keep hold of it as you will need to take it back out again once you have pushed the actual tampon in. It really does just take practice and if you can really feel the tampon inside you it probably isnt inserted correctly. xxx|`|KmoKlBgeaa	it may hurt because you aren't putting the tampon far enough into your vagina. it feels weird, but try pushing it in farther, but don't hurt yourself. good luck!|`|gEQQzfaCaa	get laid so it loosens up ur just stick ur hand in alot
Srb2IsX3aa	My teammate tore hers during basketball tryouts in mid november and was back playing varsity by late january. She was on cruches for the next 2 and a half weeks or so. It may seem a like a while until competitive sports but compared to other surgeries this is very good. And if you work extremely hard in rehab--which i'm sure you will since you beat cancer this summer(congrats!!)--you can be back even sooner than that.<br>  <br>  Of course everybody's recovery is different, because every injury and surgery is different. The best thing you can do is listen to your doctor, work as hard as you can in physical therapy, and you'll come back even stronger.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best in your recovery as I'm recovering from my own arthroscopic shoulder surgery! <br>  <br>  SP

5jf5tcMnaa	Getting into Dental school was pretty hard.  It required really good grades to be competitive.  Once in dental school, sure it was hard, and there certainly was a lot of work for 4 years.  It kept you quite busy.<br>  But the pressure was off once you were in.  It wasn't competitive anymore (well it was for the guys at the top who were trying to finish #1), but you just had to learn as much as you could while also developing the manual skills to be a good dentist.<br>  The really hard work starts once you graduate.  It is not easy being a dentist.  Eight hours a day, 5 days a week, you are physically, mentally and emotionally taken on a patient guided roller coaster.  Hunched over for so long has taken a toll on most of the dentiists that I know.  We all have upper back and neck issues.  As you can well imagine, most people don't like going to the dentist, and they aren't shy to tell you so.  You can only hear, "Doc, nothing against you, but I hate the dentist..." so many times before you just cringe eveytime you hear it.  And don't even try to imagine the pain of trying to work on a 5 or 6 or even 10-12 year old child. <br>  After a while...well you just burnout!<br>  Running a small business where patients somehow think it is ok to not pay you for working on them because they feel they shouldn't have to pay for "health care" leaves you wondering all the time, everyday if you are going to get paid for what you do.  And, I hope you like wearing roller skates.  Because if you are not jumping from patient to patient all day long, everyday...then you aren'tmaking money.  Having to pay your office overhead...staff salaries, rent, materials etc means that you always have the feeling...can i squeeze one or two more patients into an already packed day so I can take home just a little bit more.  Then of course, the no shows and last minute cancellations leave you feeling like you are not going to make any money.<br>  Then, I hope you like working by yourself.  Dentistry is not a team sport.  Sure you will work with some specialists on some of your patients.  But for the most part, you don't see outside of your office for years, nor do you interact with other dental professionals except your staff.<br>  Know what you are getting yourself into before contemplating a career in Dentistry.  Shadow a few dentists,observe what it is like working in that office 8 hours a day, 5 days a week.<br>  I hope you have a strong back and broad shoulders!|`|Jswomud7aa	My husband is a dentist. He said that it was very hard. He would time how long he could study in one day with a stop-watch. He would stop the time whenever he wasn't actually studying such as when he'd use the restroom or eat. His best time was 12 hours straight in one day!<br>  <br>  My attention span just isn't that long haha<br>  <br>  It's a lot of self-learning. Many questions on tests are over things you learned on your own. They give you a ciriculum to follow, but you are basically teaching yourself.<br>  <br>  I would ask yourself why you want dentistry. What does it mean to you. It's not only the actual dental work itself that you will be doing everyday, but it's also running a business, managing staff, working with insurance companies and the government.<br>  <br>  Sorry my answer isn't so romantic. Good luck!
mtcapSXDaa	My grandmother, my mother and myself all have Pcos, which can naturally make it harder for us to get pregnant, as you know. My mum once had a 9week long period, so she was given noresthisterone To stop it and fell pregnant shortly after wards with and she also carried on having periods. The doctor says she managed to conceive because the tablets helped get her hormoes to stabilise. Please don't build your hopes up incase your not but there is a possibility x x x

Really just say whatever pops into your head it makes it alot easier.  Obviously u cant say "hey u look better in the dark", or "I hope u look this good when im sober," thats just a baaaaaad idea and u shouldnt say it in the first place. So talk about whatever pops into ur head and if she doesnt get into it, aye, just move onto something else, bring up past events an stuff like that. Just make sure its appropriate to her personality.  She sacrifices for you and u sacrifice for her, relax man.

AA10034577	Getting into dental school is not easy.  She is right they only accept about 2% of those that apply, ok maybe a little more than that, but it's not very much.  You need a good science background in college and job experience such as shadowing is preferable.  Being rich and out of state never hurts either.<br>  <br>  Dentists who start out will work at least 30-40 hours a week.  YOu probably won't make that much money, but you'll have to work a lot.  Student loans aren't cheap. When you get your own practice and get established then you can hire people to do the work and only work about 15-20 hours a week.|`|04118ae23b43083371f655128f6eb539aa	Don't become discouraged.  Get real world advice from a young dentist.  The dentistry field has changed from when I was a young patient.  In the old days, dentists seem to be mostly concerned in filling teeth as a way to make a living.  My dentist would have a number of chairs working at the same time to maximize profits.  This guy had an antique Rolls-Royce parked out front.  My new dentist is young and very concerned in the care and art of dental care. Keep up your grades to become a great dentist and not a "hack".|`|6b2c780c41a3648dc5ae321eec588c0caa	Go for the gold!  Be a dentist.  You will have a path to being your own boss.  My niece just became a dentist and she didn't have the type of grades you have!  She ended up going to a very prestigious dental school too.  I would really recommend trying to meet some dentists and get their advice on how to get into dental school!  The recommendations of actual dentists help you get in along with good grades.  You might also try to take some classes in business and finance since eventually you'll want to be on your own and this is something that all too often isn't addressed in dental school!  If you are willing to move to a state that has fewer dentists you can get your loans paid off in no time at all if you are careful.  <br>  <br>  There is no doubt that dental hygiene is a good career but you'll never be your own boss, no one will ever call you doctor, and you'll not be able to rake in the profits that a dentist gets.|`|AA12136927	I'm a dentist.<br>  <br>  Surprisingly, prior to the early 90's, getting into dental school wasn't too difficult (as far as I know).  Nowadays, getting into dental school is very tough.  It's almost as competive as getting into medical school.<br>  <br>  In terms of numbers, realistically, a 3.3 and a 19 will make your application competitive, but not strong.<br>  <br>  As for dental school, it's miserably hard.  And unlike medical schools, they are more than happy to fail people out.<br>  <br>  Dentists typically work 4 to 4.5 days a week.  Despite the potential for earning a lot of money without having to deal with many of the hassles from which physicians suffer, the work a dentist does can be frustrating at times--almost always because of patients.  In fact, I'd say that the nature of the work offsets the easy work hours and significant pay.|`|LtlFQWvaaa	I am not in that professional field. But I can tell you that you should keep your dream.

It could be that in a past life you were killed by either hanging or something where you were suffocated and so you are recollecting that in your head without even knowing it.  All you can do is make sure your collars are very loose, your necklaces are long (no chocker styles) and try to put them on for a very short time and then increase the amount of time you wear it by a few seconds until you get used to it.<br>  <br>  What I mean is take a necklace that makes you gag and just lay in on your neck without hooking the clasp.  As soon as you feel yourself start to gag, take it off your neck.  Then put it back and leave it there until you start to gag and then take it off.  Within a relatively short amount of time, you should be able to eventually leave it there for a while without gagging.  Once you can do that, hook the clasp and then right away unhook it.  Keep on doing that until you can hook it and leave it there without gagging.  Then do the same thing with shirts.  <br>  <br>  Beleive me me, it works, I was terrified of the dark and my friend who is a psych major and a book I got from my therapist say to stand right by the light switch, turn off the light and turn it on as soon as you get scared, then make it longer and longer until you are no longer scared.

AA11928225	No. But not for the reasons given.  You actually burn more calories when the body is cold than when the body is heated.  So all those answers that say clothing keeps the body warm so that it burns more calories have it all backwards.<br>  <br>  When your body is overheated it actually burns fewer calories.  So if you want to burn more calories when you are running naked on your treadmill, make sure you turn off your furnace and just put on the fan (it is winter so you shouldn't need the air conditioner).  Have a fan blow on you as you run naked, and maybe take a cold shower just before you start.  Then start running while you skin is still wet.  Your body will burn many more calories attempting to get your body back up to normal body temperature than it would if your body was warm and it was trying to cool itself off.  Of course you might get the sniffels from this too.  And your body will start to get wet from the sweat anyway.<br>  <br>  The drawback to running naked on the treadmill is injuries.  Your naked feet will start to chaff on the treads and that will be unhealthy.  Likewise, if you trip as you run, you will not have the clothing to protect the more delicate portions of your body from the tread as it rips through your delicate skin.<br>  <br>  You may also find that certain portions of your anatomy will become sore from bouncing back and forth off one thigh and then the other.  Perhaps wearing at least a jock strap would be a good idea.  But you might not be well endowed enough for that to be a problem.  Just  a word to the wise.  On the other hand, the ancient Greek Olympics were always conducted completely naked, so maybe the body adapts to this.|`|232e4e6ba2bc0d7353269ae014be1e89aa	Wearing clothing while working out gets your body temperature up faster and keeps it up there longer (sweating off the fat).  Running naked wouldn't provide that advantage.  But hey, do whatever you please. : )|`|756a085e6f439fa1923841b7786a47f1aa	No, because when you wear clothes, it increases your body temparature.

Alright, you want serious, try this:  Running naked will expose more skin and improve the bodies cooling system (evaporating sweat), which in turn will allow you to work harder and not overheat.  With out the use of shoes, your intrinsic feet muscles and ankle muscles have to work harder to deal with impact from the treadmill, sort of like running on sand.  So yes, you would in theory get a better workout naked.  I should warn you that without proper support the effects of gravity on certain body parts can be disastrous .|`|ddb892c9fb5ba41656a4c07842aad009aa	no but u might make some money off of this|`|e311397238ea1239de6defd4a3866341aa	umm no. running with clothes on puts more weight on your body and that make you hotter. the more hot you are the more sweat and fat you'll burn. so keep your clothes on|`|26f367a805d1972fcb3ba5b055e15cf3aa	not unless you are wacking off lol

ea20852a0c8f58f3bdcf81256f224cbaaa	Hey, I know how you're feeling. I have the same problem but mine was because my gums were unhealthy and I had gum disease. I had deep scaling and root planning procedure ( when they remove the bacteria from under the gumline) and it improved.<br>  Next I invested in a Sonicare toothbrush ( about $50 but well worth the money). It thoroughly cleans your teeth and massages your gums so they can be healthy and it stopped the recession!<br>  Go to another dentist, maybe he'll tell you something different.<br>  If your gums are receeding only because of the way you brush then definately get the Sonicare, it's a miracle worker.<br>  Good luck!|`|78w4tdS4aa	It may be that no one has a specific answer or solution, but you may want to consider a different product line of dental care.

kspF7rVQaa	First of all, exercise is NEVER a lost cause. Secondly, you need to vary up your exercise routine. The elliptical and cross trainers are actually the least beneficial cardio machines you can use because they don't force you to use your entire body like a treadmill. Treadmills are the best; bike's aren't bad. What is probably happening is that your body is stabilized. It knows you are going to burn so much every day and rather than helping you lose wieght, it depends on it. What you need to do is shock your body. Jump on a treadmill, do some bike, or even switch up the routine on the elliptical (i.e. interval training, hill training, fast, slow etc). Also, you need to be doing weights. I know ab exercises alone won't help, but in combination with cardio they will. Also, doing weights helps to increase your metabolism so you burn food faster. It will also help tone your body overall and, like mentioned earlier, shock your body. Remember, you should always switch your routine every 4-6 weeks or you will plateau<br>  <br>  Also, diet is very important, especially for losing wieght in your midsection. Eliminate things with lots of sugar, fatty foods and any fast foods or resteraunts altogether. You can treat yourself once in a while, but if you are serious about losing weight, you need to eat healthy. Weight watchers is an excellent program that offers both good nutrition but allows for flexbility in diet.|`|7S2sXMJ1aa	I always say to people you HAVE to give it 6 Months!!!|`|AA11640586	Of course you should keep exercising. Even if you had a perfect body you should keep exercising for internal health. Without exercise your body will become weak, lazy, tired, sickly, flabby (even if toothpick thin) and mental health is affected as well (a person can become unmotivated, depressed, lacking in self-confidence, etc.)<br>  <br>  The midsection is a difficult area to tone. Exercise will help melt and redistribute the weight, but you will need to supplement this with good old fashioned crunches and other exercises that target the muscle group you want to strengthen and tone.<br>  <br>  You can do it... you've been an inspiration to yourself and others for two months. Keep it up.|`|EQcuNRJzaa	6 months my *** your wasting your time pal!! I give it two months, you are either overtraining or undertraining.

Perhaps you're eating too many calories than you burn?  Cardio helps you lose fat, but do take into consideration for strength training routines, too.  Building muscle increases your metabolism, and muscles burn more fat than cardio.  Exercising alone won't do much, for you have to keep track of the amount of calories, fat, protein, and sugar you consume in your diet to help you lose the fat.|`|e7bf4cad98fb7041353eb54b049f317aaa	I'm on my 4Th month ..doing the same thing your doing .Do not stop the tummy is the last to go!! and I see a SLIGHT difference .I really want to quit but I'm not going to .If we keep it up ...It will work I wish you the best of luck!!!!|`|f9a542f09bb5ac1850f2e4555fbba7d1aa	Ithink  you should first take care of your diet.Dont give up keep exercising coz i think you have made a difference no matter how little it may be.imagine if you had the weight that u have lost already +your present weight?To me change sometimes is gradual dont quit keep trying and soon you will see a very great change.You can do it!Go for it!|`|mEWqmKm0aa	#1 you cannot "SPOT REMOVE" fat, despite what they show on TV you cannot remove fat from one particular spot of your body at a time.

It's a totally free diet and exercise plan...and it works! I lost over 30 pounds using their website to track my intake. It's wonderful!<br>  <br>  Here's some more tips that I've written up (especially check number 6):<br>  <br>  1. stop eating most grease, fat, salt, & sugar. <br>  -this means NO fast food. fried foods. greasy food. fatty foods. sodium. sugary foods (including, but not limited to, candy & soda pop). <br>  <br>  2. drink a lot. i mean A LOT. of WATER! <br>  -at first this may cause you to put on some slight water weight, but in the long run it helps flush the fat out of your body. also, did you know that 90% of the times that you are hungry you are actually thirsty.  You especially need water since you are exercising everyday.<br>  <br>  3. do NOT starve yourself. <br>  -eat about 6 very small HEALTHY meals daily. that way your body won't go into starvation mode and it will easily process the food you eat and use it for energy instead of fat. <br>  <br>  4. keep track of your calories eaten. <br>  -you should probably aim to eat around 1,500 a day. do not go under 1,000. this all depends on your BMI, sex, etc.<br>  <br>  5. eat HEALTHY. <br>  -this means organic foods. vegetables. no white breads...eat lots of healthy 100% whole grains. fiber. etc. buy only healthy low fat/reduced fat & calorie foods....however just because they are healthier does not mean you can eat as much as you want of them. eat only 1 serving portion according to the nutrition label on the box. <br>  <br>  6. exercise. <br>  - Did you know that researchers have now proven that DIET is more important than excercise when it comes to losing weight. (<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13821677/)..." rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13821677/).....</a> Exercise is important to keep a fit and tone body...and it definately helps maintain your health! I don't really exercise, but I do walk (sometimes lol)! Exercise also help you feel fuller longer. but remember...when you are exercising everyday, it does not mean you can cheat on your diet. <br>  <br>  7. take a daily vitamin <br>  -...I take WeightSmart. there are also some other healthy vitamin supplements that help you lose weight in the long run. one of them that is good is called CLA. CLA helps to lose fat and gain muscle. you can buy it at wal-mart or basically any store that sells vitamins. i wouldn't particularly recommend diet pills. they're kind of a waste of money and not good for your body.<br>  <br>  8. weigh yourself. <br>  -at least once a week, if not everyday. (you should aim to lose about 2 pounds a week.) also, set a long term goal weight & date.(based on if you were to lose about 1-2 pounds a week.) <br>  <br>  9. BE PATIENT!! <br>  -i cannot emphasize that enough! losing weight takes a while & believe me we all want a miracle overnight cure, however it simply does not exist. but if you stick to these things and really follow them. you will lose weight AND keep it off. if you try to lose the weight too fast, you'll just gain it right back. trust me. also, you will have slip ups, don't let them get you down, just start over again the next day...eventually you'll get it right, i promise!!! <br>  <br>  10. remember that you are on a diet & let everyone around you know too. <br>  -so that way they can support you. remember that out of sight=out of mind. get that junk food out of the house.

f635bebcbfddf31b7558210383fdf886aa	Your poor daughter. I know what she is going through. I started when I was 9 and it was bad for me too. Imagine being 9 and wearing a C cup and having to go to gym during that time of the month, TERRIBLE! I am 19 now and this is what I did. What I suggest is, as far as the cramps, have her take Advil. They really help with the cramps and when the cramps ease the vomiting will hopefully stop too. Most girls ,who start young, period do come at different times every month and it is normal. She might stop all together in a couple of months but she might also just be irregular until she hit 15 or 16, she might even skip months at a time. A doctor can tell you more about that but mine told me that it was normal and that it will be back on track around 17 or 18 and it was. And the smell issue, Have her to wash under her arms every morning and to put on her deodorant as usual but then put baking soda on top of that. It get the sweat and cuts down on odors, and have her to wear a light body spray to give her skin a smell. And get her some sport bras since she still have small breast. They will be good for her for right now and fit really close to the body to kinda help the nipple thing. <br>  I hopes this helps.

Note that if you do a crunch in correct form, I don't believe you can do hundred reps in one go, but if you train them with weights, you may be able to crunch with 300 lb one day!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/sisco9.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/sisco9.h...</a><br>  <br>  ===========================<br>  <br>  NOT FOR BEGINNERS<br>  <br>  OK, if you really need a hardcore ab workout, do weighted decline (or incline, different terms same movement) crunches, 5 sets to failure. The weight should allow you to do around 12 to 15 reps.

Then I used a paper towel and a soft toothbrush if there was still some on my gums.

f4be00160ca85a682e1550740bd70575aa	THC takes 120 days to clear from teh system. Taking Golden Seal 2-4 tabs three times daily will take care of any THC left. Good Luck.<br>  <br>  Producing clean urine  <br>  <br>      <br>  THC is fat soluble, and it gets stored in your fat cells. Cleaning it out of your lipid tissue is very difficult. Many herbal products claim to clean out your system, yet they do nothing to remove THC byproducts from fat cells. A study was done in Germany in 1993 on 50 of the most common herbs used by people trying to pass the test. All 50 herbs failed to cause a negative. Unfortunately, this rumor will not die. <br>  <br>  Goldenseal (plant) is useless; yet it's the most common thing for people to use. The only way to extract THC from fat cells is to exercise (5.8). Fat cells secrete fat with THC metabolites at a constant rate, regardless of what herbs you consume. You may be able to temporarily clean THC metabolites from your bloodstream, or dilute your fluids to yield a larger urine/THC ratio, but your bloodstream will continue collecting THC metabolites from fat. Your urine will continue collecting THC metabolites from your bloodstream. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  6.1 Dilution:<br>  <br>  Hyper saturating your body with fluids will dilute metabolites possibly below the 50 ng/mL threshold, depending on your metabolism. Be aware that creatinine levels are often tested, and will show that the sample has been diluted. Diluting your sample will also produce clear urine, with virtually no yellow color. They will assume that you've diluted your sample, and they may reject your sample on the basis of color alone. <br>  <br>  It's only necessary to start drinking just before the test. Those who drown themselves in fluid days before a test are only causing unnecessary discomfort. Those who stay up all night drinking don't have any better chance than one who drinks heavily first thing in the morning. Get up early if the test is early, but don't lose sleep over a test that's given in the daytime. <br>  <br>  6.1.1 Water: <br>  <br>  Drink at least eight hefty glasses of fluid (preferably water) just prior to the test. Many people start drinking water several days before the test; which is useless. Water does *not* clean any THC metabolites out of your system because THC is not water soluble. Water only dilutes urine temporarily. Do not over do it; you can get water intoxication. People can actually overdose and even die from water intoxication. It's very hard to do, and you'll vomit before anything gets serious. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  6.1.2 Creatinine level: <br>  <br>  Eating red meat will boost creatinine levels. If you eat a lot of red meat for the 3 days prior to the test, your creatinine level will be normal, and the lab won't know that you've diluted your urine sample. <br>  <br>  6.1.3 Vitamin B: <br>  <br>  Color your sample yellow by taking 50 to 100 milligrams of vitamin B. Many vitamins will work, but B-2 or B-12 (found in B-complex vitamins) are the most effective, though some will argue that vitamin C is better. This will also help if you plan to dope your sample (section 7). This does not guarantee that dilution will work. Diluted samples have been red-flagged when specific gravity and creatinine levels are tested and below normal. If you're taking vitamins at the last minute, check to see if they're time release. If so, crush it up and consume the powder. Coloring your urine isn't all that important because it's normal for people to have clear urine even when they don't consume much fluid. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  6.2 Diuretics: <br>  <br>  Diuretics make people urinate frequently. Coffee, cranberry juice, beer, iced tea, herbal tea, and Pepsi are all good diuretics. Grapes are known to be very good diuretics. Diuretics without caffeine or alcohol are recommended because caffeine and alcohol have negative side effects. Cranberry juice is also the cheapest. Avoid salts. Herbal diuretics do better than home remedies like juices. <br>  <br>  6.2.1 Ultimate Blend (c):<br>  <br>  This product used to be known as Test Free, but the name was changed. Ultimate Blend is a diuretic designed for the test, but works no better than other diuretics. Ultimate Blend is sold by Zydot Unlimited Inc. <br>  <br>  6.2.2 Detoxify Carbo Clean (c): <br>  <br>  This is a very new product, untested by a third party. It claims to absorb toxins, however, experts say that absorbing THC metabolites from fat cells is impossible. Here is a copy of the ad from Party Hut Enterprizes: <br>  <br>  [Detox] Is a scientifically formulated carbohydrate blend that works by absorbing toxins and imuurities[sic]. It has been featured in High Times, and we are so confident of the results that we are offering a double-your-money-back guarantee for any failed results. This is the most complete program for the cleanest results! Precleanse (tm) herbal capsules are enclosed in every box of Carbo Clean. This extra advantage helps you begin cleansing the evening before the deadline. B-Complex tablets complete the program. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  6.2.3 Naturally Klean Herbal Tea (c): Naturally Klean claims to clear any drug metabolites for a few hours after taking. Drink this shortly before the test. Naturally Klean was also listed as a drug screen in previous versions, but according to Nightbyrd, "it will do NOTHING to help you pass a urine test;" with the exception that it will dilute your urine. You can get Naturally Klean from Martha Butterfield-Jay Foundation or J&J Enterprizes. An anonymous user provided the ingredients list: dandelion root, burdock root, red clover top, chamomile flower, alfalfa leaf, licorice root, slippery elm inner bark, hibiscus flower, dog rose hips, natural fruit flavors. Dandelion root is said to be the effective diuretic. <br>  <br>  6.2.4 Goldenseal: <br>  <br>  Goldenseal is a plant and you can get either the root or the leaves in pill form. It's also a liquid or tea. The liquid is rumored to absorb slower than the capsules. Goldenseal is a diuretic, but works no better than other diuretics. Furthermore, NORML reports that Goldenseal is now being tested for. Taking Goldenseal is a foolish waste. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  6.2.5 Certa or Certo: <br>  <br>  This is an untested diuretic. Certa "has something to do with canning. Some people swear by it. Trouble is, it's always somebody else, a third party not present during the conversation, who uses it" (Pearson). I've heard rumors about people who smoked right up to the day before the test, consumed fruit pectin (a canning substance similar to Certa), and passed the test. However, there hasn't been any tests to validate those claims. Will someone with a lab at their disposal please test this stuff? <br>  <br>  6.2.6 Vales Original Formula: <br>  <br>  Another herbal remedy like Goldenseal. It does nothing. The water you must take with it does everything Vales claims to do. <br>  <br>  6.2.7 Lasix: Take an 80 milligram dose of prescription diuretic lasix (furosemide). Prescription diuretics are the most potent. Some over the counter diuretics will color your urine blue and should be avoided. WARNING! -Diuretics can be harmful to people with kidney problems, pregnant women, and diabetics.- <br>  <br>  6.3 Vinegar:<br>  <br>  There is a myth that drinking vinegar will mask drugs; it won't. However, vinegar lowers the pH of urine. Amphetamines are excreted up to 3 times as fast when urine is acidified. So vinegar could reduce the detection time period for amphetamines. The effects on detection time are generally insignificant, and it in my opinion it really wouldn't be worth it to drink vinegar. If you do decide to drink vinegar, I hear it's easiest to get a shot glass and do it in shots. It will cause diarrhea. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  6.4 Dexatrim:<br>  <br>  There is a myth that taking phenylpropanolamine (Dexatrim's active ingredient) will work. It won't. In fact, Dexatrim is a false positive, and may work against you. The myth may have originated because Dexatrim was claimed to speed metabolism. However, the fact that Dextrim causes a positive makes it useless. <br>  <br>  6.5 Fiber: <br>  <br>  A high fiber diet will help by redirecting fat soluble metabolites to the colon rather than bladder. "THC is eliminated primarily in the stool via bile acids. Both EMIT and RIA detect a secondary metabolite which is reabsorbed from the intestines. Thus a person with a high fiber diet will excrete a majority of THC [metabolites] in the stool" (anon1). A fiber-based laxitive will also help by binding bile-acids. Use caution. Fiber laxitives can alter one's bowel schedule and lead to dependancy. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  6.6 Vitamin lecithin:<br>  <br>  A recent method that's still under development is to take vitamin lecithin. This vitamin breaks down your stored fat and disperses it into your blood stream, to help clean out drugs that store themselves in lipid tissue, such as THC. NORML recommends taking Lecithin right up to the day of the test. To me it sounds as though this would work against you because by putting THC back in your blood stream, you are increasing metabolites in the urine. <br>  <br>  Someone has suggested that you take vitamin lecithin on a regular basis to clean lipids of THC metabolites. Then quit before the test, which seems to make more sense. It MAY be useless to take lecithin supplements orally. I've been told that the digestive system breaks it down too much before entering the blood stream. Most aren't willing to take vitamins intravenously. (If you do decide to take lecithin, you might as well take B5 with it. B5 aids in the process of turning lecithin into acetylcholine.) Another solution is to take nutrients which help the body manufacture lecithin. Lipotrophics cause the liver to produce lecithin. A good source for this information is Austin Nutritional Research page. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  6.7 How to give a clean sample: <br>  <br>  Don't give urine from your first urination of the day. It's the dirtiest, and can be heavily filled with metabolites. Urinate a couple of times before giving a test sample. Also, don't give the beginning or end of the stream. Piss in the toilet, then quickly stop and go in the cup. Stop, and shift back to the toilet for the last portion. Only give a midstream sample. Just be sure to give 60 cc's. <br>  <br>  6.8 Exercise: <br>  <br>  Athletes have a big advantage over normal civilians. When fat is burned, THC byproducts are released into the blood. This is the only way to get THC metabolites out of lipid tissue. "Normal living will burn them slowly, as your fat reserves get turned over" (Dr. Grow). Due to an athletes high metabolic rate, THC moves through an athletes system significantly faster. Exercising between drug tests will clean THC metabolites from the system at a faster rate, thus lowering the detection period. It is important to stop burning fat cells near test time. On test day, it doesn't matter what's in your lipid tissue. What's in your blood and urine does matter. <br>  <br>  Exercise increases the amount of THC metabolites in the urine; so quit exercising a week before the test. Be lazy, and eat big. This will put the body in an anabolic fat-storing stage. At this point, the "buried" THC metabolites won't escape and go the the urine. There are drugs that will increase metabolism the way exercise does, but these are the same drugs that they are usually testing for. Exercise should only be considered when the subject knows that he or she will not be given a pop quiz in the near future. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  6.9 Beta-2 agonists:<br>  <br>  Studies have shown that Clenbuterol reduces fat, which would help rid lipid tissue of THC metabolities. Clenbuterol also increases metabolism. No studies have directly shown that Clenbuterol will help pass a drug test. However, provided that it reduces fat, I would assume that the fat breakdown would result in less fat soluble substances in the system. Caution: Clenbuteral is labeled as a performance enhancer, and it's on the banned list for athlete testing. If are being tested as an athlete, avoid Clenbuterol! <br>  <br>  6.10 Beta-3 agonists:<br>  <br>  Beta-3 agonists are drugs that stimulate the beta-3 andrenergic receptors on brown fat cells. The beta-3 andrenergic receptor is located on the surface of fat cells, and controls the amount of fat the cell releases into the bloodstream. When brown fat is stimulated, white fat is burned (converted into heat). Many people have mutant beta-3 andrenergic receptors, causing calories to be burned too slowly; thus leading to obesity. These people will benefit most from beta-3 agonist drugs. <br>  <br>  If the drug works as claimed, I believe it would reduce the detection time of fat soluble drugs by continually excreting metabolites into the bloodstream at a faster pace. As with vitamin lecithin and exercise, you would take beta-3 agonists between tests, and quit a couple days prior to the test. Beta-3 agonists have been in the development phase for the past 13 years. One firm is already testing a beta-3 drug in early clinical trials. It's not on the market yet. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  6.11 Low dosaging:<br>  <br>  If you're an athlete and get tested for steroids, you can still use anabolic steroids and possibly beat the cutoff. The body naturally produces testosterone (a steroid), and small amounts of testosterone show up in urine by default. Some athletes are able to keep their steroid intake low enough to indicate a natural level of steroids. A study was done finding that 67% of steroid users take more than the recommended amount, and they stack (meaning they take two or more different kinds of steroids). Steroids are only meant to be used in small amounts to begin with. Anything over a normal dose goes unused. Also, no study has shown stacking to be beneficial.|`|7e354f22d8d8b33cf8efe82443dfb3a5aa	The best 'wash' is pure apple juice, but I don't know how much time you have.before the test.|`|AA10672813	Dunno

Or others advice fat burning supplements.|`|VHp086UWaa	Being as young as you are this is the best time of your life to lose weight.  Instead of asking how to become slim you should have given an amount of weight to lose.  We don't know if you want to lose 100 pounds or 20 pounds.  You should not lose more than 2 ponds a week from diet and exercise.  Try to mix a hard Cardio workout with a solid diet.  Try to drink only water and diet drinks for 2 months.  This will increase the calories burned while decreasing the calorie intake.  This is the quickest and safest way to lose weight.|`|72c41dfb15d08515fe72aa1a806d307faa	Diet, exercise.<br>  Eat healthy foods, low in calories, low in fat. <br>  I would recommend going vegetarian, very healthy and cuts out<br>  most of the bad foods.<br>  Eat a big breakfast, and for dinner something small; like a salad.<br>  <br>  Walk, if you hate to exercise, for about an hour a day. <br>  That really does help, and if you do the diet correctly then the result <br>  would show.<br>  <br>  It really depends on how serious you are about getting slimmed down, and if you are, then it would only be a matter of time.

Crunches and sit ups are the best. This happend to my mom and my older sister. It's natural. She just needs to do sit ups and crunches. The doctor isn't lousy, he sees people all day all week.

Try having her do lite cardio like walking outside with her kids in a stroller, added benifits for the little ones. And then have her start doing some yoga. There is a book out their that helps mommy's with the loose tummy muscles, it it actually called mummy tummy but not sure about author. Yoga helps strenghten your back which helps hold your stomach muscles in. I hope this helps out some i had a baby of my own and i know that it takes quite a long time to get those stomach muscles under control.|`|L6or6ChUaa	my mum gave birth 2 nearly 3 years ago on march 31st and she still has a big round tummy|`|YtqN5vcjaa	It is possible her stomach muscles are weakened now.

AA10934351	no, it's not true, as long as you have clean hands (or toys) it's perfectly safe. masaturbation actually helps our sexual drive and finding what we do and don't like. so the more you masturbate (as long as it doesn't get out of hand and addictive) the better chances of having an orgasm when you are with a partner. what i don't understand is who would tell you that it was unhealthy??|`|ySSuAlhaaa	Yes, this is true.  Girls are suppose to have sex with boys and not masturbate.  As we all know, boys have to masturbate because girls don't want to have or cannot have sex with them.

bc43dc6bd8b75ec537c61f7b1ddcd2feaa	Wow, I never heard about that. Do you recall where you read it? Do you take magnesium and calcium? Taking these can help with irregular beats. 1000mg calcium/500mg magnesium usually easy to find in a supplement you take 3x daily. Alot of people say taking them separately helps too and taking the magnesium on an empty stomach. Try googling magnesium for heart and see what the research says! It's very interesting. Also make sure you're getting enough potassium and H2o!! =)<br>  <br>  <br>  Well, I've had skipped beats since my teens due to my anxiety/panic disorder. I have been taking the fish oils for many years because of the research I did that claims it is good for yu to get lots of fish oil. My cardio said my pvc's are normal tho and everyone has them. I have maybe one a day if that and haven't noticed the fish oil made it worse. It wouldn't hurt to switch to the flax oil, I do it sometimes if they are out of my omega brand I normally buy. Give it a try and see if it helps. Have you ever read about the herb motherwort? My NaNa has runs of svt and since she started the motherwort she is doing much better - she also does the magnesium and calcium. <br>  <br>  Try this<br>  <a href="http://www.mdidea.com/products/new/new031.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mdidea.com/products/new/new03...</a><br>  <br>  or google it, there's a ton of info on things that will help with this problem.|`|x6uaGeEEaa	I haven't heard that it works before.<br>  There are lots of natural herbs you can take to help you.<br>  Try going to a herbalist inyour country.<br>  Good luck...!!

w9Mkns0Naa	The clitoris (Greek κλειτορ??) is a female sexual organ. In humans, the visible knob-like portion is located near the anterior junction of the labia minora, above the opening of the urethra and vagina. Unlike the homologous male organ (the penis), the clitoris does not contain the distal portion of the urethra and functions solely to induce sexual pleasure. The only known exception to this is in the Spotted Hyena, where the urogenital system is modified so that the female urinates, mates and gives birth via an enlarged, erectile clitoris, known as a pseudo-penis. Clear enough for you?|`|M7ixRpelaa	fun to suck on......|`|ZRScOoU7aa	a female sex organ|`|232e4e6ba2bc0d7353269ae014be1e89aa	The clit, or clitoris, is a sex organ on a female.

It is only there to make us woman feel great.  It response very well to stimulation, some refer it to a 'female penis' because of it's sensitivity.
AA11686559	Since sometimes on your right side and sometimes on your left side, try to track if its right in the middle of your cycle (around day 14). If it is, its just the pain you get from an egg releasing during ovulation. If you have cyclical cysts, which a lot of women do, it can make it a bit more painful. They are harmless cysts that burst when an egg is released each month.  If the pain gets unbearable, go for an ultrasound, but sounds like normal ovulation to me!<br>  <br>  By the way, don't hold your bladder. Go when you have to go.

It's not something you're born with and it usually starts with a simple diet but when a person struggling with it you really cannot see what everyone around sees and your mind becomes obsessed with you weight or lack of for that matter.

This is a vague question. You could be asking one in a million different things about your life. First you need to identify your problem. Then you need to look at all sides of the situation. Then you need to plan a course of action. In planning a course of action for life it helps with sitting down and setting goals. The goals should start with now, near future, a little further, and then long term goals. Some goals may not seem realistic right now but sticking to your path will get you to where you want to be.

Of course, if you are going to be doing yoga 4 times a week you are probably going to get sick of Sun Salutations...in which case I would definitely recommend you getting Farhi's book so that you can explore many other yoga poses and add them to your routine! <br>  <br>  (If you are already active, you can combine yoga with your current work-out routine and practice yoga at least twice a week.)<br>  <br>  I like to practice yoga first thing in the morning.

K83v2OKjaa	If you have had sex since your last period, it's possible.  Many people experience the tiredness and food aversion symptoms of pregnancy very early in their pregnancies.<br>  <br>  If you think that you might be pregnant, you should go ahead and start treating your body as though you are.  No alcohol, no smoking, and get a doctor's appointment ASAP to discuss any prescription and non-prescription drugs that you might be taking.  Better safe than sorry when it comes to protecting a baby.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.

Unfortunately, you can target your legs to burn fat; your body will decide for you where it wants to burn the fat first. Bear in mind also that because of your age, you may find it difficult since you're still goriwng and your body is still deciding how it wants to form. There's even some genetic influence involved. But intevral cardio traning is very effective. As a personal trainer, I've helped a woman lose 40 pounds over the course of a summer (and keep it off) by helping her consistently exercise. Keep up the cardio and you'll see some results. Just be wary of your age and don't be disappointed if you lose the results. That's just natural growth for your age.|`|0HNpXRzpaa	cycling and spin class will help trim the leg flab, and lift the buttocks too.|`|4MSV7wZqaa	You are too young to be worried about your weight.

AA11660907	First of all, stop feeling bad about yourself. You are a healthy weight and you are being too hard on yourself. Losing weight takes time for some people, you read on Yahoo Answers about a lot of people who dropped a tremendous amount of weight in a short period of time. Remember that every person has a different body type and if you stick with your routine of exercise and healthy eating, your body will eventually shed the pounds. Also, take into consideration yuor exercising, a lot of women tend to obssesse over the scale. Instead, keep a log of your measurements because when exercising, you are gaining muscle which is heavier than fat. Do not strive to be the air brushed models we see in the catalogues because that is not reality and everyone has some imperfection so it's impossible to expect yourself to be perfect. As far as not liking the eliptical, try other cardio work outs that will give you the satisfaction you had from jogging. I always blow out my ankle, so I've resorted to swimming, it's a great work out and just as exhausting and difficult as running and obviously easy on the joints. Also, working out hard 6 times a week also might have done your knee in, your body needs a break and running 6 days in a row will take a toll on you, let the joints and muscles heal so you don't further damage anything. Remember you are a beautiful person, focus on just being healthy and happy and be grateful for your situation.|`|RY4ULL6Zaa	You have a distorted body image, you amy want to talk to a therapist about it.|`|18c1a98889e5159a5048cf908c4ce4f4aa	i suffer the same prob but wid muscle size people say i have nice sized muscles but i think there tiny|`|IHuKyBfLaa	Don't eat any less that what you are eating now 1200 calories is as low as anychild should eat.

6RPLWdF6aa	No, this was not your period. <br>  <br>  Although it may seem like there was a lot of blood, this is still referred to as "spotting". Yes, this is a typical reaction of first-time birth control users. I remember having similar symptoms to what you've described when I started taking a birth control pill called Mircette. Although my doctor told me this was normal, I asked if I would be able to switch to a pill with a lower dose of hormones and see if that would make a difference. I tried Mircette for 3 months and had severe "spotting" each month! After that, she then put me on a low-dose pill called Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo. I have now been on Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo for over 2 years and have never had any adverse, uncomfortable, or strange effects while on it.<br>  <br>  I would try Lorestrin for a few months and then ask your doctor about switching to different pill if you still experience the type of spotting you explained in your question. :-) <br>  <br>  Best of luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. When you are on the pill, you should have your period when you are taking the "placebo" pills (those without medication).|`|398289727dd55c1fff36132ac9ed5b4faa	mayb your body just needs to get use to it|`|6a2ba29722a51e76794888b42e466eb1aa	Maybe or maybe not. More than likely you will start up again and finish your period. Since this is your first time on birth control it will take awhile for your body to adjust. And then when it does your periods will come on time every month especially if you are taking your pills as directed and not missing any doses. Try not to stay on the birth control pills for too many years because it does mess with your system.

Gn5wODeRaa	I had social phobia with slight agoraphobia a few years ago.  I ended up dropping out of school because of it.  I would feel the same way you did - afraid of humiliating myself in public or embarassing myself.  I had a hard time going into stores to shop because of all this too.  If I did happen to go into a store, I would make someone else cash me out.  It was aweful.  I spent a lot of time at home doing nothing.<br>  <br>  I finally sought help, and saw a psychologist.

You are what you are. Thats what makes you unique. Be yourself. You are a beautifull person!|`|RtIS3ksXaa	Oh my goodness, i have the same problem. It's so annoying. However, after taking a developmental psych class i learned that it's somewhat normal for younger people. There's a theory that during your teen years, people constantly worry that others are judging them--it can be as small as somone noticing a microscopic pimple on your face--when in reality everyone else is worried that they're the ones being judged. So be comfortable about yourself and when others see this they'll be comfortable around you too. <br>  <br>  I stutter and stumble over my words a lot. I think sometimes this is because I over think what I'm going to say. So speak from the heart and be able to laugh at yourself. No one's perfect ya' know. Oh and by the way I get that feeling of not being able to concentrate too. It's ok youre normal. I think everyone suffers from this to some degree.<br>  <br>  I mean who cares what other people think. Not everyone's going to like you. Hope that helps :)|`|kv15lJ7paa	Your not alone, the more you go out though, the less you will think about it. I still from time to time suffer from this, but you need to stop over-thinking, its hard, but with practice you will over come it. Try to think positive thoughts, when a bad thought enters your mind, think of a time when you felt completely at ease and confident. With time you will overcome it. <br>  <br>  Part of the problem is your brain is hardwired to think negative at this time. You need to switch this thinking. So think positive thoughts and eventually your brain will be hardwired for positive thoughts. Takes  time and will not happen all at once, its a slow process. Just keep at it.

Its actually really easy once you start watching the numbers and it doesn't seem like work or exercise. Its just a matter of changing the way you think about loosing weight.<br>  <br>  I use this method when i gain some pounds. The first time I did this I went from 168 to 127<br>  <br>  2) Most people do not get enough water in their system. Water is your body's principal chemical component, comprising, on average, 60 percent of your weight. Every system in your body depends on water. For example, water flushes toxins out of vital organs, carries nutrients to your cells and provides a moist environment for ear, nose and throat tissues.<br>  <br>  Lack of water can lead to dehydration, a condition that occurs when you don't have enough water in your body to carry out normal functions. To determine if you are getting enough water use this simple formula..  Take your weight, for example 150 pounds and divide by 2. Take your answer which is 75 lbs and change it to ounces, in this case 75 ounces. That is how many ounces of water you need a day. Your body performs mostly on water. If you make sure you get enough water everyday your body will perform at top notch and your body will no longer have the cravings of junk food. You will have a better performing body system to help you work out and feel better thru out your day.|`|FojIRglyaa	you can keep doing crunches, which will lead up to sit-ups.  crunches are designed for you to go half the way of a sit-up.  keep it up and you will see results.  keep crunching, and good luck|`|JkuDkYgCaa	I start a crunch or sit up  I get into position by used a pillows on floor  between my shoulder balder and neck .

Its a combination of nutrition, cardio, and strength training.<br>  <br>  Cardio (2-3 days) you could start off with walking or biking.<br>  <br>  Strength training (2-3 days) If you workout at home. Try a full body circuit training workout. Working each one of the muscle groups.<br>  <br>  <br>  Nutrition<br>  1.   Fat<br>  At every meal, you must eat an adequate amount of good fats. Good fats include Omega-3 EPA/DHA concentrates and monounsaturated fats like extra virgin olive oil. Bad fats include trans fatty acids found in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils and Arachidonic Acid (AA) found in fatty red meats and egg yolks.<br>   <br>  2.   Protein<br>  To keep your insulin levels in the Zone at every meal, you must always consume adequate amounts of low-fat protein (about the size of the palm of your hand or about 3 ounces for most females and 4 ounces for most males). A typical snack contains 1 ounce of protein for both women and men. The best protein sources are skinless chicken, fish, turkey, lean cuts of meat, low-fat dairy products, egg whites, protein powder and soy meat substitutes. <br>   <br>  3.   Carbohydrates <br>  In addition to good fats and protein, you must also eat carbohydrates at every meal and snack. However, not all carbohydrates have the same effect on insulin levels. Starches (like pasta, potatoes and bread), grains and rice elevate insulin levels too much, whereas, most vegetables and fruits do not spike insulin levels (a few exceptions are corn, peas, bananas and dried fruits). While this doesn’t mean you have to completely eliminate starches, grains and rice from your diet, you must eat much smaller quantities of them compared to your intake of vegetables and fruits. <br>   <br>  It’s as easy as 1, 2, 3.<br>  The Zone 1-2-3 Method makes it simple to determine the fat, protein and carbohydrate content of every meal and snack. For every gram of fat you consume you need to eat twice as many grams of protein and 3 times that amount in grams of carbohydrates.<br>  <br>  Meals for Females<br>  At each meal consume approximately:<br>  10 grams of fat<br>  20 grams of protein (2x the fat grams)<br>  30 grams of carbohydrate (3x the fat grams)<br>  <br>  Snacks for Females<br>  At each snack consume approximately:<br>  3 grams of fat<br>  6 grams of protein (2x the fat grams)<br>  9 grams of carbohydrate (3x the fat grams)<br>  <br>  <br>  Meals for Males <br>  At each meal consume approximately:<br>  15 grams of fat<br>  30 grams of protein (2x the fat grams)<br>  45 grams of carbohydrate (3x the fat grams)<br>  <br>  Snacks for Males<br>  At each snack consume approximately:<br>  3 grams of fat<br>  6 grams of protein (2x the fat grams)<br>  9 grams of carbohydrate (3x the fat grams)<br>  The 1-2-3 method is an easy way to make sure you get the right balance of fat, protein and carbohydrates to “turn on” a fat-burning metabolism and satisfy hunger at the same time. <br>  <br>  Remember, the above numbers are approximate. So don’t worry about being 100% precise. Hunger control between meals and how your clothes fit are your best barometers for success.<br>    <br>  Timing<br>  Eat a Zone meal or snack within one hour after waking. To keep your insulin levels in the Zone so you are burning stored fat instead of accumulating it, eat every 4 to 6 hours after a meal or 2 to 2?  hours after a snack (including one at bedtime), whether you are hungry or not.<br>  <br>  Liquid<br>  Drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day.|`|TK0mX6lxaa	I first started wrestling 2yrs ago, i weighed 220lbs all/mostly fat.....two years later, i now weigh 165, with a flat stomach, awesome abs, and a toned body....im not going to lie, sit ups and crunches are hard, but i tried something called six inches, most of the other athletes were doing it perfectly! First you lie flat on your back, and raise your legs about 6inches of the ground(its going to be hard to keep them up at first, so i used books to hold my legs up).....then try and lean forward, only raising your head and your shoulder blades, you should feel your stomach tighten up.....do this for about 30seconds, start with 2reps, and increase everytime you try!!!

Es hasta que causa problemas ya fisicos cuando nos damos cuenta, y muchas ocaciones aun asi no pensamos en el estres como la causa de algun mal fisico.<br>  <br>  Si este es el caso de alguien debe disminuis sus niveles, y para eso puede apoyarse de un profesional un medico o incluso de terapias o ejercicios de relajacion, hay bastantes, pero sobre todo, hay que detectar aquello que mayor estres me produce, y atacarlo de fondo ademas de lo anterior.|`|5WtpGncxaa	En la general de causa, la mayoria de los argentinos sufren de etrees sin darse cuenta. Generalmente es por falta de alimento Espiritual. Asi como alimentamos al fisico, tambien debemos preocuparnos por alimentar nuestro espiritu. ?como?  Tratar de repartir nuestra vida cotidiana entre la rutina de todos los dias y por ejemplo; una disciplina fisica de orden espiritual, yoga, Libros espitiruales , conectarnos con DIOS de la manera mas intensa, ya sea una oracion, un rezo, una charla intima entre DIOS y uno (como si estubieramos hablando con el mejos amigo y confidente que tengamos)  <br>  Ayuda y muchisimo, aunque no parezca es muy equilibrante|`|AA10492394	definitivamente|`|CeJPqIoWaa	supongo que sí, pero debe de llegar un momento en que te preguntes ?qué me pasa? ?por qué me siento así?, ??|`|GA3RW3x0aa	Que es estres para ti? Te refieres a las tensiones y preocupaciones o algun sintoma fisico o mental en tu cuerpo que se haya asociado con el estres?Si es asi, la respusta es sí, pues muchas veces el estres te va agarrando poco a poco y te vas acostumbrando a esos sintomas.

Como también el stress puede manifestarse de mil maneras y tú no te das cuenta que es eso.  Por eso debes aprender a conocerte, conocer tu cuerpo y tus reacciones para que así distigas cuándo estás en stress.  Algo muy peligroso de estar en stress y no darse cuenta es que nuestro sistema nervioso llega a un punto que no puede más y ese stress se convierte en depresión y esa depresión, muchas veces nos lleva a tocar fondo e inclusive se requiere de hospitales para mejorarse.  Así que, cuidado con el stress y buena suerte.

So, for these 3 days, the soreness will prevent you from reaching your full potential. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't work out. Instead of resting entirely, do just 15 push ups instead of 50. And drink a protein shake when you finish! If you don't have a protein shake just lying around, drink a tall glass of milk! =) This will help rebuild your muscle and relieve soreness so that you can have a better work-out the next day. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|88cacd703ace2bdf239eaf8e4275eb09aa	Take a day off and let your muscles recooperate, then try again tomorrow.|`|bV3N5l4Faa	You should rest a little bit.

38a636252c3dfa62b74a78560926dd7baa	Suc biliaire<br>   liquide jaunatre sécrété par le foie ; relatif à la bile.  La bile (ou suc biliaire) est sécrétée par les cellules du foie et contribue de fa?on déterminante à la digestion des graisses. De couleur jaune verdatre et de saveur amère, elle contient 97,5% d'eau, des électrolytes (substances en solution dans l'eau sous forme d'ions), 0,60 g de cholestérol libre non estérifié par litre, un pigment, 0,050 g de bilirubine par litre (*) qui résulte de la décomposition de l'hémoglobine, ainsi que des sels biliaires (3 à 4 g/L) qui émulsifient les graisses en les réduisant en particules microscopiques et permettent ainsi leur digestion dans l'intestin. Un adulte sécrète en moyenne 0,5 à 1 litre de bile par jour, de fa?on continue. Elle est stockée dans la vésicule et le canal cholédoque et est libérée dans le duodénum au passage des lipides. La bile est extrêmement riche en corps dissous instables qui peuvent, sous l'influence de différents facteurs, former des cristaux et des calculs (c'est la lithiase biliaire) dans la vésicule et les voies biliaires.<br>  (*) La bilirubine est un produit de la dégradation des hématies ou globules rouges et qui est dans un premier temps insoluble dans l'eau  Dégradation des hématies - origine de la bilirubine  , c'est-à-dire que les reins ne peuvent pas l'éliminer dans les urines. Cette bilirubine est appelée libre ou non conjuguée. On trouve dans le commerce des bandelettes réactives qui permettent de différencier les valeurs normales (3 à 8 mg/L de sérum) des valeurs pathologiques (au-delà de 20 mg/L) par simple trempage dans le sérum du malade. Elle est prise en charge par l'albumine et transportée dans le foie où elle sera glycuro-conjuguée par une enzyme, la glycuronyl-transférase. Elle est maintenant soluble dans l'eau et peut être éliminée avec l'urine. C'est la bilirubine conjuguée. Ces deux types de bilirubine vont déterminer deux grands types d'ictères : à bilirubine conjuguée ou à bilirubine libre, avec pour chacun des causes bien spécifiques.<br>  - Dans les ictères à bilirubine libre ou non conjuguée, les causes sont celles qui augmentent les produits de dégradation des globules rouges : maladies hémolytiques qui détruisent un nombre trop important de ces globules rouges et provoquent l'ictère hémolytique, déficit dans les cellules hépatiques des enzymes (notamment la glycuronyl-transférase) nécessaires à la transformation de la bilirubine libre en bilirubine conjuguée ou tout autre facteur susceptible d'augmenter la bilirubine libre dans le sang. Dans ces formes d'ictères, les urines restent claires et cette particularité peut être un facteur de diagnostic.<br>  - Dans les ictères à bilirubine conjuguée, les causes sont à rechercher dans les pathologies du foie ou des voies biliaires (ictères par hépatite) : hépatites à virus, à bactéries, tumeurs du foie ou des voies biliaires, cirrhoses, fièvre jaune, entre autres. L'une des caractéristiques de ces ictères à bilirubine conjuguée est qu'ils génèrent souvent des urines très colorées, voire foncées. <br>  <br>  Suc gastrique<br>  L'estomac se divise en 2 régions principales : * le fundus avec les grandes fundiques, qui occupe environ 85% de la surface de la muqueuse gastrique et qui comprend essentiellement trois types de cellules : les cellules pariétales qui sécrètent l'acide chlorhydrique et le facteur intrinsèque, les cellules principales ou à pepsine qui sécrètent la pepsine, et les cellules à mucus (ce mucus mettant la paroi gastrique à l'abri contre l'acidité et l'action des enzymes.  Les régions de l'estomac  * L'antre qui est la zone des glandes pyloriques (le pylore est la communication entre l'estomac et le duodénum), environ 15% de la surface de la muqueuse gastrique, avec deux types de cellules : des cellules à mucus qui sécrètent aussi des pepsinogènes (groupe II) et les cellules "G", principal type cellulaire endocrine de l'estomac, qui produisent la gastrine. La gastrine est l'hormone qui est responsable de la stimulation de la sécrétion gastrique (l'autre mécanisme est nerveux : c'est une branche du nerf vague ou pneumogastrique ou X - 10e paire de nerfs craniens). Lorsque l'on fait une exploration biologique de l'estomac, les 2 produits le plus souvent dosés sont le suc gastrique et la gastrine.<br>  - La gastrine est un polypeptide de poids moléculaire 1500, contenant une quinzaine d'acides aminés. Sa sécrétion est provoquée par l'arrivée des aliments au contact de la paroi antrale et interrompue par l'augmentation de l'acidité gastrique. Son dosage se fait généralement par radio-immunologie sur un prélèvement de 5mL de sang chez le sujet à jeun. La valeur considérée comme normale est de moins de 100 ng/L (nanogrammes par litre de sérum), mais cette valeur peut varier notablement d'un laboratoire à l'autre. En ce qui concerne les variations pathologiques, on observe une nette diminution après une vagotomie et une augmentation dans l'anémie pernicieuse, le syndrome de Zollinger-Ellison où l'on trouve un adénome des ?lots de Langerhans qui produit de grosses quantités de gastrine; lors d'un ulcère duodénal, d'une gastrite atrophique, d'une insuffisance rénale chronique, entre autres.<br>  - Le suc gastrique est normalement incolore ou très légèrement teinté de jaune et faiblement odorant. Il est secrété à raison de 1 à 1,5 litres par 24 heures. L'examen cytologique ne montre que quelques leucocytes, hématies et cellules, sans débris alimentaires si le sujet est à jeun depuis au moins 12 heures. Quant aux bactériologies, il n'y en a aucune qui résiste à la forte acidité du suc gastrique qui est donc pratiquement stérile. Seuls les bacilles de Koch (tuberculose) peuvent résister au milieu gastrique quand un malade avale ses expectorations. Le liquide gastrique est un mélange d'une sécrétion acide produite par les puits gastriques du fundus  (partie haute de l'estomac), riche en HCl (acide chlorhydrique) et d'une sécrétion alcaline, produite par la région antro-pylorique (région de l'antre proche du pylore - partie basse de l'estomac), qui contient de la mucine et du bicarbonate de sodium. Les deux fractions acide et alcaline ne se neutralisant pas, il en résulte, pour le liquide gastrique prélevé à jeun, un pH voisin de 3,8. Dans certaines pathologies comme les ulcères gastro-duodénaux, l'anémie de Biermer entre autres, il est intéressant de doser l'acidité libre (0,5 à 0,6 g d'HCl par litre et l'acidité totale (environ 1g HCl/L). Ces calculs permettent ensuite d'évaluer le débit d'ions H+ en fonction de l'acidité libre et du temps de recueil.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://georges.dolisi.free.fr/Terminologie/S/suc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://georges.dolisi.free.fr/Terminolog...</a>|`|1aa40983ab748891280c937914601a6faa	tous les deux contribuent à la digestion  et l'assimilation des aliments.l'un vient du foie et l'autre, très corrosif se trouve dans l'estomac.|`|3b4d5d6445124d4f9b00982814cde7baaa	le plus simple:<br>  La bile c'est le foie<br>  Le suc gastrique, c'est l'estomac.|`|e6f5d94c97e40bd8daccc0d779635b8aaa	La bile est un liquide organique sécrété et recyclé par le foie (jusqu'à un litre par jour).<br>  <br>  Entre les repas, la bile s'écoule au travers du canal cystique jusqu'à la vésicule biliaire où elle est stockée et concentrée.<br>  Le chyme riche en acides gras provenant de l'estomac est per?u par la paroi du duodénum.

G8xJJ2Nraa	What you need to do, is CARDIO!<br>  <br>  I have a simular situation, or had..and the key to this, is not just eating properly & drinking water<br>  Do you workout? If so, how often?<br>  Cardio.. it's simple... proper diet + cardio= abs! <br>  <br>  Simply put, if you do not burn the fat off the mid section you will never see the abs, and the best way to incorporate that, is if your not pushing heavy weights, start somewhere.. theres a cool site... t-nation.. and there's alot of help and insight there.. of course the key to all is nutrition! I eat a few small meals a day, about 5 to 6, to keep metabolism moving, and I lift heavy 3 times a week, and have incorporated cardio 4 sessions a week..<br>  <br>  You know whats cool.. interval cardio sessions.. or try some HITT training, Ive done that also, anything you can do to keep moving and heart rate going.. never be fooled you can show those abs without riding the fat.. Ive learned that lesson.<br>  <br>  On t-nation: I read something that goes like this..<br>  <br>  to rid fat: if you have 3 hours a week to train... weight train, in other words.. lift and lift hard. <br>  <br>  If you have 5 hours to train a week, lift hard and then incorporate two interval cardio sessions.<br>  <br>  If you have 7 hours a week or better, then you should lift heavy, do interval cardio training 2 times a week, and then 3 steady state cardio sessions! <br>  <br>  In no time you will be a sexy lean machine! <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.. now get to work!!|`|VbseNtSwaa	yeah proper eating and loads of jogging|`|e1dc61fe86e4539f88ffde7d3e99425aaa	have you tried sit ups or crunches?

mwV4tbT3aa	I think it only depends on who you call nigg*r. If you were to say it to a buddy who is not sensitive to the word, then it may be okay. If you say it to someone who is p.c. and takes offense to the word, then they may consider you to be a racist. Vice versa for whitey being called a cracker. If your white, guilt for all of the things your ancestors did will usually stop you from saying nigg*r at all. I was surprised at many white people in one of my "Hispanic" filled classes, which had no "African-"Americans present,  who hesitated to repeat nigg*r but easily spurted out beaner, spick, and wet back during a discussion about racism.|`|H7hwiGNAaa	I know this seems like a rediculious problem, but I think that thee American society is trying to repair the damage we have imposed on the African/ American and lack communities over the years.

Non tutte le donne sono sante .. Notte|`|eigFNyf8aa	Una domanda così è un pò mal posta, secondo me non è che è più difficlie essere una donna al giorno d'oggi per via delle violenze,degli stupri (che come hanno già detto colpiscono anche gli uomini forti e sani, i disabili, la vecchietta o i  quindicenni) ma perchè oggi si è creata una specie di convinzione in base alla quale le donne devono essere brave in tutto: competitive e brillanti sul lavoro, brave mogli o fidanzate, madri attente. Senza, in tutto questo, perdere la loro femminilità. E noi donne ci stiamo abituando all'idea di dover rispondere a tutti questi ruoli e ci sentiamo anche in colpa se non ce la facciamo.Purtoppo anche la donna si sta appropiando di alcuni modi di pensare tipicamente maschili (leggi: competitività esacerbata, aggressività) e questo non va bene non perchè il pensiero maschile ha qualcosa che non va ma perchè non ci appartiene, ci snatura. Un ultima riflessione: noi, cioè noi uomini e donne insieme, dovremmo collaborare per trovare un nuovo equilibriio fra i sessi che non voglia conformare un sesso all'altro, che mantenga le diversità di ognuno. So che è utopistico ma le utopie servono a mostraci quale direzione prendere, qual'è l'ideale verso cui tendere anche se non lo riusciamo a realizzare.|`|yBtfje43aa	Ciao,anke io la penso come te.Ogni giorno noi donne ci interroghiamo se andiamo bene anke se con qualche chilo di più,oppure dobbiamo avere paura di mettere un piede fuori di casa.Prima era meglio,non c' era discriminazione,pensa un po che dei ragazzi di 16 anni sono maschilisti!Non è possibile vedere ragazze anoressiche o sentire al TG che sono morte delle ragazze perché violentate.Oppure sentire che una donna viene picchiata a sangue.Non siamo più nel1934 dove c' era la discriminazione sulle donne.Il tempo passa,facciamo vedere che anche noi cambiamo.baci|`|0dpUADdVaa	non la vedo cosi' personalmente parlando, è difficile essere di qualunque sesso quando non si ha una personalita forte, ma se uno ha carattere tutte ste cose... non c' entrano con il sesso: vengono stuprati anche gli uomini e anche i bambini se per questo, ricevono le corna e anche tante anche gli uomini, si prendono e ricevono botte anche gli uomini... tutti ricevono ste cose, non c' entra il sesso!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|YXMg3p7Kaa	se vai a documentarti sulla vita delle donne di tutte le epoche vedrai che la nostra non è poi così male,|`|3b66400bcd4f0a94d1edd5d81ddb48baaa	eh si da una parte hai ragione ma avete anche tanti vantaggi...e non credere che essere un uomo sia piu facile se no sbagleresti...|`|OY44dTURaa	è cosi difficile oggi essere una donna.. perchè è sempre più difficile trovare un Uomo.. uno con la U maiuscola..
318cc58aa371766e29991feb829affc9aa	It depends on the source of the lack of motivation.  If you're going at it too hard, this could lead to burnout and a lack of desire to do cardio since it's miserable.  Lots of people fall into this trap.  If you're simply bored with it, maybe it's time to experiment a little and find other cardio activities to do.  Trudging along on a treadmill or stationary bike can be tremendously boring and not everyone can tolerate that.  <br>  <br>  If you're hitting it too hard, try throttling back to a more reasonable pace and work your way up from there over time.  You should increase slowly on a weekly level.  If you make progress, this in itself is fun and you can make a game out of it.<br>  <br>  Boxing, jumproping, hiking, biking or running outdoors, swimming, kickboxing, etc.  The best cardio exercise for anyone is the one that we enjoy doing and will stick with.

Le truc est de remettre le bébé au sein ou de lui donner un peu de lait au biberon (à un débit pas trop rapide). D'habitude ?a passe comme ?a. Sinon, on peut bercer le bébé, faire un tour de poussette, d'auto, etc. Mais en tant que tel, il n'y a rien à faire pour faire cesser le hoquet, donc il faut attendre que ?a passe. Par contre, on peut s'assurer que le bébé fait bien ses rots durant le boire (habituellement un au milieu de la tetée et un à la fin), mais on peut aussi lui en faire faire plus fréquement (comme pour les bébés qui boivent au biberon, ils aspirent généralement plus d'air).

qY3zxldBaa	ok heres 3 stretches that helped me ALOT!!!<br>  <br>  1- stand back to back with a partner while holding hands. have 1 person totally relax their head and back on the other person.  then the person thats not relaxing straight down until the relaxing person tells you to stop. (when it hurts) then trade positions.  hints*** relaxing person keep knees straight and heels on the ground.. although this may not hurt it helps alot. just do it as often as you can (at least every other day)<br>  <br>  2- this sounds weird. but one of the best  streches for spilts is just to simply touch your toes. the closer you are the closer you are to getting your spilts. this may hurt quite alot more then the other stretches but just hold it for 30 seconds, then relax, then 30 more and your done!<br>  <br>  3- since stretch #2 stretches the back of your leg now you need to stretch the front of your leg. so, stand up straight and 1 at a time pull your leg up behind you keeping both knees touching. hold this for 1 minute, relax, do it agin. <br>  <br>  SOME other tips to being able to do the splits:<br>                *be sure you're warmed up before you try<br>                *try rocking (front to back) into them <br>                *picture your muscles stretching longer and longer<br>                *relax<br>                * just keep trying!!!<br>  <br>  god luck. im sure you'll get it sometime! just keep practicing!!|`|dz9K4K2Raa	um....if you find out,  please let me know|`|fb660be1cbe5b787ccbb99c45595dfc6aa	well I'm a cheerleader so really all you need to do is try to stretch your body out like sitting on the floor opening your legs as wide as you can then stretch to the left, the right, then the middle, and or you can go sit up to the wall and open your legs as wide as you can facing the wall then stretch. If those don't work try to do the splits then try to push your self into them. Just stretch your body so you will be flexible enough to do them.|`|yQapqkFDaa	um i am in cheer leading and streches we do r put both legs in front of u and touch ur hands to ur feet and ur nose to knees and another one is just do the splits slowly they will come in time and find a yoga group that really helps :)

950033929f6c3f4712d32b18be06c3f5aa	Jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjaaaaaaaaaaaaajjjjjjjjjj...<br>  A quién en la vida no se le ha escapado un pedo en medio de muchas personas que se hayan puesto inquietas ante dicho ruido maquiavelico?, un ventoso o flatulencia o como se le quiera llamar, se le puede escapar a cualquier persona porque es un proceso intestinal normal en los humanos y otros animales e incluso insectos. Pero… porque apestan a huevo o algún otro olor desagradable. No se diga lo rojo que se pone uno!<br>  La información a continuación ha sido extraida de un post que encontré en Yahoo! Respuestas que me pareció digna de compartir con todos, y que aclaro de esta manera para no hacerme de los créditos a quien corresponden.<br>  <br>  “El Caminante” escribió lo siguiente:<br>  * ?Que es lo que hace que los pedos tengan olor?<br>  El olor de los pedos proviene de peque?as cantidades de Sulfuro de Hidrógeno y Azufre (Acido Sulfhidrico) libre en la mezcla. Cuanto mas rica en Azufre es su dieta, mas de esos gases van a ser producidos por las bacterias en su intestino, y mas hediondos seran sus pedos. Alimentos como cebolla, coliflor, huevos, son notables por producir pedos apestosos. Por otro lado, por ejemplo, los frijoles, producen grandes cantidades de pedos, aunque no necesariamente hediondos (dependiendo de la cantidad de ajo que usted le meta a la Olla para evitar tanto mal olor)<br>  *?Por que los pedos hacen ruido?<br>  Los ruidos son producidos por la abertura anal. El ruido depende de la velocidad de expulsión del gas y de cuan estrecha sea la abertura de los musculos del esfinter anal. En términos populares, un c@#%o bien apretado va a tronar mas fuerte. Por eso aquello del pedo sorpresa, que a pesar de tratar de sacarlo “soplado” (silencioso), sale bien tronado ante las caras perplejas de los demas (como si ellos nunca se hubieran tirado uno y fueran “extrapedestres”)<br>  * ?Cuanto gas produce una persona normal?<br>  En valores promedio, una persona produce el equivalente cercano a un litro de pedos por día (vaya si somos una cajita de sorpresas, mas bien una caja de pedos, asi que sueltenlos o van a explotar como globos), distribuidos en aproximadamente ?14 pedos diarios!, asi es, no lo nieguen.<br>  * ?Cuanto tarda hasta que el pedo llega a la nariz de alguien?<br>  Depende de las condiciones atmosféricas, humedad y velocidad del viento, también de la distancia entre las personas. Los pedos tambien se dispersan; su potencial nauseabundo disminuye con la dilución. Hay quien presume de poderes sobrenaturales, como hacer “levitar” las sabanas de la cama. En realidad solo es un pedorro potente y, muy posiblemente, proximo divorciado por intento de asfixia, piensenlo, ?acaso no son los peores?, los mas dificiles de dispersar, parecen “pegajosos”. Condiciones excepcionales existen cuando el pedo es liberado en un area peque?a y cerrada, como un ascensor, un cuarto peque?o o dentro de un automóvil, porque esas condiciones limitan la cantidad disponible del diluyente (aire) y el pedo va a permanecer en una concentración que permitirá su percepción por mas tiempo, hasta que se condense en las paredes.|`|15e85143e2c7d17d92b911eae1608206aa	Tómate un litro diario de perfume y usa calzoncillos de fierro... jejeje (una broma).<br>  <br>  Purgate... toma un laxante aunque sea una vez por semana, te recomiendo que no comas tanta chatarra ni picantes. Si sufres de pedos debes asentar con tus comidas con algun mate caliente (anis, manzanilla, mate), tu estomago te lo agradecerá.<br>  Trata de comer alimentos que contengan fibra vegetal (verduras y frutas), los pedos huelen feo porque el estomago esta recargado y la fibra te descongestiona este problema.<br>  <br>  Saludos desde Lima.|`|AA10492394	cambia los alimentos en tu dieta alimenticia|`|dWMdkC2Baa	come flores ..y ponte un silenciador,,, y asunto resuelto...|`|hhHNk0G7aa	uff  que  pregunta|`|08611ac23c66d945b9cd6fe5f9c175c0aa	Por los olores come sano y no te apestaran tanto,q no haga ruidoponte las manos atras y tal vez no se escuchen alto,.|`|21NhAyBAaa	a parte de comer flores, trágalas con un poco de cloro y pon una almohada en el trasero así no corres riezgos...jijiji|`|ChUuSWvEaa	Cambia de dieta, como màs frutas y agua en abundancia, veras como cambian el olor y ya no van a tronar, lo que sucede esque es estomago se sobrecarga con comida bastante condimentada y en gran cantidad y ese es el resultado.|`|DHksSeH3aa	aaajajjaajjj<br>  (YYYYYYYYYYY)<br>  la estrella a la pregunta qe marqe esta bn mereciiida <br>  beeso.|`|a113f381dd3b96be7f490a13bbb73745aa	Jaaaaaaaaajaaaaaaajaaaaaaajajajajajajaja...<br>  <br>  Que bueno está esto vale, jajajaja..

HPn75mp8aa	There are exercises you can do, but simply with dumbbells I'm not too sure. You can try a bent-arm pullover, or some heavy duty lat pulldowns to see if that helps but the only real way to do pull-ups is to do pull-ups.<br>  <br>  I had a bar installed leading to my kitchen and every time I walked by I'd hop on and see how many I could do. At first I could barely do 3 of them in a row but eventually I was able to get up to 10 in a row without much of a problem.|`|K39s7sI4aa	Ironically, the best exercise to do pull ups is...doing pull ups.<br>  <br>  Sorry, no sarcasm intended.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|61c66382b3887de7b511eab825bdc3e4aa	Working out with weights and performing Pull Up`s are two different forms of strength training. There isn't any weight training exercises that you can do to excel in resistance training which is what Pull Ups, Push Ups, Sits ups are.<br>  <br>  Resistance training uses elastic or hydraulic (water) forces to oppose muscular contraction and isometric exercise uses structural or intramuscular forces (e.g. doorways or the body's own muscles<br>  <br>  If you want to increase your capability to perform sets of pull ups use a " Spotter " just like you would when performing bench presses!|`|3l4Y9RWmaa	don't use dumb bells if u need help with pull-ups just do push-ups and then keep doing  it then try pull-ups trust me it works i get a's in p.e.|`|NTLZtbyiaa	this is the best to get to a full pull up<br>  <br>  <br>  Jumping pullups (use as much leg push as needed, lower slowly . . . this really keeps the cardio going <br>  <br>  Pure negatives (climb to top position using whatever means necessary, chair, bench, whatever, then lower slowly)<br>  <br>  Assisted Pullups: use a Gravitron machine (if you're lucky enough to have access to one), or, even better, a human spotter to give you a lift. Bend your legs at the knees so that the tops of your feet are facing down, have the spotter support you there to provide some lift.<br>  <br>  Assisted pullups 2: Get a large elastic band (surgical tubing works great), loop over the bar, step in it to provide some lift<br>  <br>  <br>  Reduced load pullups: Suspend a bar (maybe an Olympic bar for weights?) at a height less than overhead . . . maybe about chest high . . . get underneath it with you legs in front and body straight . . . do "pullups" with your legs still on the ground, supporting part of your weight . .All of these have the advantage that they are neurologically more valuable than the fairly un-natural motion of locking your knees under a pad and moving just your arms . . . in all of these, your arms are going to be drawing your whole body up . . . you will progress toward "full" pullups faster.But yes, you can do pull-downs, and doing those are infinitely better than skipping this workout.|`|YSzq7zUDaa	You could try lifting them over your head and down. up and down, etc..|`|02e273ebc2df1e5f768fd25036235d10aa	Bi-cep curls as well as tri-cep extensions|`|XD2HDLEDaa	rows works out your back which is key to doing a pull up

AA12280005	Its Spirulina. Yes I've had it. its green algae and is supposed to have many health benefits.you can buy it in pill form but im not sure where. or you can do what i do. go to a good grocery store or bruegger's bagels near you . They have this brand of juice called Naked Juice. they have all kinds and one of the flavors is called "Green Machine". It has many veggie and fruit juices mixed with the spirulina along with wheat and lemongrass. It actually tastes good, its the texture you gotta get used to cuz it is kinda thicker like a smoothie. And a tip: shake it well before you drink it if its been sitting and make sure it's cold cuz it is yuck when it is warm...I like it and drink a couple bottles a week. Good luck and enjoy the benefits!|`|26b652b65764cccabed8b8e68d2d8727aa	It's supposed to be very good very you.  Don't know if you're supposed to take it in place of actual veggies though.

Do a bit of cardio when you can (try to sneak in a couple of 10 minute brisk walks during breaks at work.)  Or just walk/jog when you get home.  Strength training will help tone the muscles and slim you down.  Keep the weights light and focus on form rather than number of reps.  If you don't have access to weights, use water bottles and do activities like lunges.  Yoga/pilates are excellent at lengthening your muscles and slimming you down.

buX0W68Waa	Alright... ready for this!? lol...<br>  <br>  I do boxer conditioning with a great friend of mine. I love boxing, and my friend is hilarious, and ya. <br>  <br>  One thing that really helps me is having a friend who is really healthy - she motivates me and since we spend lots of time together I'm healthier now because of it. For example, when she grabs a grilled chicken whole wheat pita, I do too!<br>  <br>  Another thing, my man just got back from being at a different university than me this year. So... while he was gone I decided to join boxing, eat healthier more often in smaller portions, ect. because I wanna suprise him when he gets back! I made a decision to change my lifestyle.<br>  <br>  And it's paid off! A month ago I wore a belt that I hadn't wore for months --- I had to CREATE a new hole to wear it! And now (it's been 4 months roughly since I began my health craze) ALL my clothes are falling off me. I needed to go shopping BADLY because as of late I looked rediculous --- and I just found out this past weekend that I've gone down from a size 7-9 to a size 5.<br>  <br>  I feel better when I work out, and the healthier foods I eat the more I crave them instead of other things. Whenever I crave sugary sweets, I turn to really sweet fruit like grapes and oranges (after all, most candies ARE fruit flavoured). When I crave something sweet and salty, I go for a small bowl of cereal. Slowly but surely, by eating healthier, you won't crave junk anymore. <br>  <br>  Also, I didn't limit myself! Weed out the junk, don't try to stop automatically because that will result in binging. I didn't straight up expect to not eat junk ever again, but tried to be more cautious, and eventually it weeded itself out. Here's an example - I still live at home, so during the day I eat lots of fruits and veggies and whole wheats because I know that at supper time I'm not the cook and I'll have small portions of whatever the family is eating. I also treat myself once a week to whatever I've been craving and I've come to find that as of late, I haven't been craving junk that much at all.<br>  <br>  I also find that listening to Headstrong by Trapt and Paralyzer by Finger Eleven when working out works wonders too... :D<br>  <br>  Sorry if this is a little long, but to sum things up --- I've changed whites to browns, been eating lots of fruits and veggies, been eating 4-6 small meals a day and have been drinking a lot of water and tea. <br>  <br>  As for being easy --- it's gradually gotten easier. As for how much I've lost --- I'm not too sure. All I know is that the shape of my body is now bikini ready when before it wasn't, my love handles have disappeared, and I've gone down in sizes.|`|6Y3TWGdOaa	eat 15 days protin diet and eat 15 days crbohidrate diet,eat more and more vegetables, drink 3 litres of water everyday. walk atleast 2 hours a day.have your meal in time.you will loose 05 kg of your weight in a month.i also did the same and my weight is also reduced.|`|faY9yOozaa	I am sure you have heard this 1,633,432 times but I will say it again.  DIET AND EXERCISE.  You cannot do one with out the other an expect significant results.  I started off with the South Beach Diet and lost 25 lbs. in about 4 months.  It was hard at the beginning but then got easy.  I put a little back down, but now I am back down to the same weight with some minor tweaks.<br>  <br>  Diet info from -- <a href="http://www.jigsawhealth.com/articles/obesity-dietary.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jigsawhealth.com/articles/obe...</a><br>  <br>  Here are good diet tips:<br>  * Eat more fiber. Fiber gives you a satiated feeling, helping you to curb food cravings. It also keeps your colon healthy, and aids in proper digestion. Research has shown that obesity puts you at higher risk for colorectal cancer, primarily due to a low-fiber, high-calorie, processed food diet. Incorporate ground flax seed in smoothies, soups, and favorite cereals to increase your fiber intake.<br>  * Skip the low-fat food products. Most of the low-fat, processed foods in grocery stores are typically high-carb foods that are loaded with sugar, salt, artificial sweeteners, and synthetic fat substitutes. Many of these ingredients cause weight gain, rather than reduce it. Read more about food ingredients.<br>  * Add virgin coconut oil to your diet. The natural saturated fat in virgin coconut oil can help stabilize blood sugar levels, facilitate proper thyroid function, and aid in weight loss.<br>  * Eat more vegetables and fruits. Not only are they a good source of fiber, but they contain many naturally occurring vitamins, minerals, and amino acids necessary for maintaining optimal health and weight. Watch out for fruit juices, they often contain added sugars that can increase your calorie intake dramatically. Opt for water, or diluted fruit juice (three quarters water and one quarter juice).<br>  * Don’t skip breakfast. Fasting activates the starvation response, slowing your metabolism and increasing the chances that excess fat will be stored to fuel your nutrient-depleted body. Studies now show that women who eat cereal for breakfast maintained their weight better than those who skipped breakfast. The plus of whole grain cereal is that it is a low-calorie, fiber-rich food.3 Obese people tend to lack necessary fiber in their diets.<br>  * Eat frequent meals. Eating five to six small meals throughout the day helps to speed up your metabolism. On the other hand, eating large meals only once or twice a day will actually slow down your metabolism.<br>  <br>  Exercise tips -- Start off slow and light, if you go to hard to begin you will get sore and be prone to take days off.  Mix it up, jog some days, walk others, play tennis, play racquetball, lift weights occassionally, do pilates, yoga, stretch.  Keep your body guessing and you will never become bored with your routine.|`|3bda4b213b77b1aca382e18f760b37c3aa	Quite simply burned more calories then i consumed, it's the only way, how you go about doing that is up to you and the more choices you have the more chance you will fail. <br>  <br>  93% of dieters not only fail weight loss they gain it all back and more, they try to complicate weight loss with fancy tips <br>  and soups and supplements when in reality it comes down to a few things.<br>  <br>  1) A calorie deficit diet using clean foods.<br>  2) An effective form of cardiovascular excercise performed daily.<br>  3) Persistance<br>  <br>  Part 3 is where they fail, you have to want to change and want to keep it off, its a lifestyle change and no easy feat, fat loss is one of the hardest tasks you can do, mentally, physichally and emotionaly taxing.

AA12252163	you run a hundred miles without stopping then take a bite off an apple...lols...<br>  <br>  anyway, <br>  <br>  The phrase 100-Mile Diet was coined in 2005 by James MacKinnon and Alisa Smith of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, to describe their one-year local eating experiment that was chronicled on independent news and culture website The Tyee. By eating food grown or produced within 100 miles of their home, they confronted the statistic that food in North America typically travels 1,500 miles from farm to plate (Halweil 2002). They chose the distance 100 miles based on the natural geography of their region: the vast Coast Mountain Range begins 100 miles from the mouth of the Fraser River where they live in the Pacific Northwest.<br>  <br>  Their one-year experiment--which ran from March 21, 2005, to March 21, 2006--was inspired by a foraged meal they ate at their remote wilderness cabin in northern British Columbia. They began to wonder if they could eat more like that in the city. While MacKinnon and Smith are the next generation to the 1960s back-to-the-landers, the urban nature of their experiment was a crucial difference, now that 80 percent of people in North America live in cities (US Census 2000; and Canada Census 2001). MacKinnon and Smith got up-close-and-personal with issues ranging from the family-farm crisis to the environmental value of organic pears shipped across the globe. They reconsidered vegetarianism and sunk their hands into community gardening. They ate a lot of potatoes.

2AhS5fWYaa	bulimia does not equal weight loss...in fact, many bulimics gain weight due to the reasons you stated above.|`|b3a237424ed1aad68bee604b26b20a15aa	Bulimia is a type of eating disorder.  Usually what happens is a person (they are usually girls, but guys can have eating disorders too) will binge on large amounts of food and then they will immediately go and throw it up.  The reason why bulimics are not as thin as anorexics is because they are not always able to throw up every bit of food they have consumed, and also, the more often they purge, the less effective it is at getting rid of all the food consumed.  Bulimia is very destructive to the body because it ruins the esophagus and tooth enamel, and it is very rough on the stomach.  People who are bulimic will sometimes appear to have a puffy/chubby face, because of the throwing up.|`|EHpZ33v9aa	you dont gain any wait because you eat but you dont wait long enough for the food to digest so your basically starving your body even though your eating|`|qWXkfsoBaa	Bulimia, also called bulimia nervosa, is a psychological eating disorder. Bulimia is characterized by episodes of binge-eating followed by inappropriate methods of weight control (purging). Inappropriate methods of weight control include vomiting, fasting, enemas, excessive use of laxatives and diuretics, or compulsive exercising. Excessive shape and weight concerns are also characteristics of bulimia. A binge is an episode where an individual eats a much larger amount of food than most people would in a similar situation. Binge eating is not a response to intense hunger. It is usually a response to depression, stress, or self esteem issues. During the binge episode, the individual experiences a loss of control. However, the sense of a loss of control is also followed by a short-lived calmness. The calmness is often followed by self-loathing. The cycle of overeating and purging usually becomes an obsession and is repeated often. <br>  Sufferers consume huge quantities of food. Sometimes up to 20,000 calories at a time. The foods on which they binge tend to be foods labeled as "comfort foods" -- sweet foods, high in calories, or smooth, soft foods like ice cream, cake, and pastry. An individual may binge anywhere from twice a day to several times daily.Some of the most common complications of bulimia are: <br>  <br>  Erosion of tooth enamel because of repeated exposure to acidic gastric contents. <br>  Dental cavities, sensitivity to hot or cold food. <br>  Swelling and soreness in the salivary glands (from repeated vomiting). <br>  Stomach Ulcers. <br>  Ruptures of the stomach and esophagus. <br>  Abnormal buildup of fluid in the intestines. <br>  Disruption in the normal bowel release function. <br>  Electrolyte imbalance. <br>  Dehydration <br>  Irregular heartbeat and in severe cases heart attack <br>  A greater risk for suicidal behavior <br>  Decrease in libido <br>  Check out these web sites

It is not normal to get "paralized" from neck pain and have it go away in a few minutes.  Now with the lun being there you need to see your dr. and see if perhaps you might have a pinched nerve in your neck.  These are treated with injestions of cortisone or a nerve block. There are other things to but you will never know unless you see your dr.

Pedro foi recebida mediunicamente por Jo?o Nunes Maia, através do espírito do médico Franz Anton Mesmer, que viveu no século XVIII. A pomada alivia diversas doen?as, principalmente as de pele. <br>  <br>  A fórmula é apresentada<br>  <br>  durante o lan?amento do livro Além do ódio<br>  <br>  O momento era de alegria, pois os 105 primeiros exemplares do livro Além do ódio, ditado pelo Espírito Sinhozinho Cardoso ao médium Jo?o Nunes Maia, seriam distribuídos para famílias de hansenianos. O local era o Centro Espírita Campos Vergal, localizado na Col?nia Santa Isabel, em Betim, próximo a Belo Horizonte.<br>  <br>  Feliz pela tarefa cumprida, Jo?o Nunes Maia percebe a presen?a tranqüila de um Espírito conhecido como Mesmer, que fora médico e curara muitos enfermos no século XVIII. Ele, ent?o, fala para Nunes:<br>  <br>  "Papel e lápis, meu filho. Vou lhe ditar a fórmula de uma pomada que deverá curar e aliviar a muitos".<br>  <br>  O médium , surpreso, apanha um peda?o de papel que embrulhava volumes do livro Além do ódio e um lápis, cedido pelo diretor do Centro Espírita Campos Vergal, e anota a fórmula do aben?oado ungüento. O nome de tal ungüento?<br>  <br>  "Pomada Vov? Pedro", esclarece o Espírito comunicante. <br>  <br>  Percebendo a surpresa de Jo?o Nunes por t?o simples nome dado à pomada, o Espírito do Dr. Mesmer completa:<br>  <br>  "é preferível que as coisas simples tenham nomes simples".<br>  <br>  E faz uma importante observa??o sobre a gratuidade do ungüento: <br>  <br>  "O pre?o desse medicamento deverá ser um, apenas um: DEUS LHE PAGUE". <br>  <br>  Recebida a fórmula, Jo?o Nunes Maia procura pelas plantas componentes do medicamento, e com muita dificuldade, mas sempre orientado passo a passo pelo Alto, prepara os primeiros potes da pomada. A primeira formula??o foi feita em uma velha panela de press?o com 2,5Kgs. Pouco a pouco , o retorno dos enfermos confirma: a Pomada Vov? Pedro alivia e cura muitas enfermidades cutaneas.<br>  <br>  Desde 1973, a Sociedade Espírita Maria Nunes, fundada por Jo?o Nunes, trabalha para que maior número de pessoas tenham acesso aos benefícios da Pomada Vov? Pedro. <br>  <br>  A produ??o é simples: plantas medicinais e dedica??o<br>  <br>  A fórmula da Pomada Vov? Pedro, recebida mediunicamente pelo médium Jo?o Nunes Maia está registrada junto aos órg?os competentes, em nome da Sociedade Espírita Maria Nunes (SEMAN). Simples como o nome, baseia-se nas propriedades medicinais de plantas e produtos naturais, como própolis, erva-de-bicho, ipê-roxo e o condurango, n?o apresentando efeitos colaterais.<br>  <br>  Os extratos para a produ??o do ungüento foram fornecidos, até 1997, pelo Centro Espírita Caminhos da Luz de Araguari, através do amigo querido e respeitado por todos, o bioquímico Nephtaly Naves. Hoje, os extratos s?o fornecidos pela Farmácia Privativa Kahena, pertencente a SEMAN. Os efeitos emolientes, cicatrizantes e anti-inflamatórios, que seus componentes comprovadamente possuem, aliviam e curam enfermidades de pele do tipo ulcera??es e feridas, hemorróidas e queimaduras.<br>  <br>   Três vezes ao ano, os tarefeiros da Sociedade Espírita Maria Nunes, num clima de amor e alegria, e com grande vontade de fazer o bem ao próximo, produzem 50.000 podes de pomada que, devidamente acondicionada e controlada, é distribuída gratuitamente, de uma forma organizada, para quem dela necessitar. <br>  A Pomada Vov? Pedro é produzida e encontrada na SEMAN e em diversos postos de distribui??o em todo o Brasil. Todos eles obedecem à condi??o de gratuidade do ungüento, n?o sendo permitida a sua venda sob pretexto algum. Por ano, s?o produzidos em torno de 1,5 milh?o de potes.<br>  <br>  Os postos de distribui??o s?o casas espíritas ligadas ao ambito dos Postos de Produ??o, nas suas respectivas regi?es.<br>  <br>  A produ??o da Pomada Vov? Pedro é apenas mais uma tarefa das casas que se sentem afinados com esse benéfico labor em favor dos carentes e de portadores de determinadas enfermidades. <br>   <br>  <br>  Ao contrário do que pensam alguns poucos desinformados, a produ??o da pomada n?o implica ou estabelece qualquer ritual, ou práticas que conflituem com os postulados da Doutrina Espírita. Antes, essa produ??o é realizada em clima de alegria crist?, onde o Evangelho de Jesus é estudado e exercitado ininterruptamente, congregando companheiros em benéfica troca de experiências e conhecimentos, contribuindo sobremaneira para a unifica??o do Movimento Espírita, sob a égide do trabalho.<br>  <br>   Como fundar um Posto de Pomada<br>  <br>  Requisitos:<br>  <br>  <br>  Trabalhadores embalam potes do medicamento para serem enviados aos postos de distribui??o<br>   Constata??o na regi?o de que haja carência do medicamento; manifesta??o de Casa Espírita que postule a condi??o de posto de produ??o; que tenha folha de servi?os na caridade; condi??es físicas e materiais para garantir periodicidade anual de produ??o e, principalmente, que tenha embasamento doutrinário e seguran?a nas práticas mediúnicas. <br>  <br>  Material:<br>  <br>  Os extratos vegetais utilizados na produ??o da pomada s?o manipulados na Farmácia Privativa Kahena e fornecidos ao posto de produ??o pela SEMAN. A fórmula da Pomada Vov? Pedro é registrada em nome da SEMAN e, à medida em que o novo posto adquire mais experiência, recebe a libera??o para produzir a Pomada sem o acompanhamento direto da Seman. Até que se atinja essa fase, a Comiss?o Central da Produ??o da Pomada Vov? Pedro e os Coordenadores Regionais dirigem as atividades. <br>  <br>   Postos de Produ??o e Distribui??o da Pomada Vov?

When you do not intake enough calories, your body will catabolize itself and use up whatever it needs to sustain itself (muscle, fat, bone calcium, etc)<br>  <br>  3500 calories = 1lb btw.|`|jR5kvXgeaa	it depends on your stats.<br>  if you are not under 5ft you shouldnt be eating this little calories.<br>  dont count calories burned - there is no way you can know it precisely.<br>  count time doing cardio 4-6 times a week for 30-50min plus light weight training is what you need for FAT loss.

Please get checked on Friday.   It sounds exactly like mono to me ( i had it ) My doc tested me on the spot and sent me to hospital as I was badly dehydrated also; which can cause you to be tired also. If you are sleeping alot you are not drinking so it is very possible you are dehydrated also. <br>  <br>  My other guess would be Lyme's disease which is transmitted by a tick bite and symptoms include being very weak and tired. It is rare so it often goes undiagnosed.|`|6j74vxsjaa	It could be any number of things.  Narcolepsy or Idiopathic Hypersomnia is possible, but usually emerges gradually.

It looks something like a deflated balloon when its unrolled (but usually comes from the package rolled up for easy application).  <br>  <br>  A female condom looks like a loose floppy sleeve, with a ring at either end of a tube.  One ring is inserted into the vaginal canal and against the cervix, the other (open) end is outside the vagina.<br>  <br>  Always apply or insert condoms (depending on type) BEFORE ANY contact between genitalia.<br>  <br>  Condoms don't hurt necessarily, but they can cause friction, drying and in some people allergic reactions.<br>  <br>  Please do some research before you consider having sex.

I ain't trying to sound like your parents but condoms arent 100% protective. You still have the rest of your life to have sex with someone who really cares about you. Having sex at an early age isn't always a good idea. Most of the times it is because the guy pressured the girl into it.

Even though sex has no age limit. FYI the condom goes on the man, and stays on during sex. No sex is the safest sex, unless your married. Condoms have been known to break so are not 100% guarenteed to protect you from pregnancy or diseases, BUT still good to use. Birth-control pills are the best way to protect yourself from pregnancy, you and your partner getting tested for hiv or std's before having sex is the safest.
AA12349719	hiya<br>  it hurts and it is humiliating as you have to dangle your legs in the air in front of some un interested looking beauticia,n who then engages you in conversation just to take your mind off the fact she is erm ,well, going to HURT you!!<br>  so a risk is the pain factor and the embarassment factor.<br>  the benefits are that you will feel sexy and look sexy and your sex life will be much better and even sitting around doign nothing will turn you on. you wont get ingrown hairs (they are more related to shaving) and if you are pale it makes no difference but if you have sensitive skin i would steer clear. try to wax a part of your leg first to see how much it hurts, then triple it.|`|gMFNz0Klaa	If your going all the way just trim with scissors first then shave with a really good razor like the gillette mach 3 for men!  And be sure to use NEW blades, shave in all directions to get a smooth shave.  When out of shower splash a little rubbing alcohol on area to avoid the itchy's, heat bumps, and ingrown hairs.  It only burns a second which is less time than waxing sensetive skin!  It may take a few days of shaving to get desired effect but is worth it in the end!  Such a major turn on for self and others!

8f668db957dd1fa8205dbb01364c580baa	Symptoms of mono are:  Extremely bad sore throat,  fever, nausea, absolutely no appetite, exhaustion even after a full night's sleep. Body aches, swollen glands, not just in the neck but under the arms and in the groin. <br>  If someone looks at your throat, your tonsils may be enlarged and yucky looking. <br>  You could also have an enlarged spleen, which your doctor will be able to see when you are examined.  <br>  <br>  This illness is caused by a virus, so antibiotics will not cure it.  Usually over the counter pain relievers, like tylenol or advil, throat lozenges or spray may help. <br>  You should be drinking as much fluids as you can.<br>  Sometimes a doctor will prescribe a course of prednisone to help relieve the painful sore throat. <br>  <br>  It sounds like you could have mono. Go to the doctor.<br>   If you do have mono, you will need a LOT of rest. If  your spleen is enlarged it is dangerous to participate in contact sports or even gym class in school, so SEE YOUR DOCTOR.<br>  It can take quite a while to feel better, even after you're no longer contagious. So be kind to yourself, get lots of rest.<br>  I hope you feel better soon.|`|d770238acec4b93b4ccf2d7d0136eb33aa	I HAD MONO WHEN I WAS 16 AND I HAD A SEVERE HEADACHE AND VOMITING AND SORE THROAT, MY BODY ACHED AND I HAD A HIGH FEVER,WE THOUGHT I HAD THE FLU BUT IT LASTED LONGER THEN A WEKK.

GOOD LUCK|`|2f43b8290e65f9221057cac067374f45aa	Mono is often mistaken for strep. If the test for strep is negative, and the symptoms persist, they may perform a blood test for mono. Mono is a virus, so there are no medications for it. They will most likely recommend a fever reducer and bed rest. it often persists for up to a month, and you will probably lose a lot of weight. Not pleasant, but not terribly dangerous. Just a pain. I can't say what the chances of you having it are. If you have a fever, maybe? But strep is more likely. If you have no fever, I'd say you don't have it. But if it keeps going, go to a doctor. Even if you have a fever, it's more likely to be strep. Mono isn't very common.|`|8Cck6isGaa	fever<br>  throwing up<br>  cold / hot flashes<br>  shits<br>  coughing<br>  mucus in the throat|`|zcZGRPc2aa	Chances are pretty good that if you are drowsy alot and your throat hurts you may have it. I have had it twice. Um one symptom is if you eat anything that has citric acid in it like tomatoes or oranges and you vomit then you could have it and also blisters on your tongue and by your tonsils. Un fortunatley it just has to run its course is what my doctor told me. I didn't get anything prescribed at any time i had it but if it is really bad they could give you nausea pills but usually thats only if you start dropping weight rapidly. Best advice is to go see a ear nose and throat doctor or go to the ER and explain your symptoms and ask for a lab test done for mono. My first time they thought it was just tonsilitis until it got so bad i vomited some of my stomach acids.

jOu7WtR8aa	Check the ACE, NSCA, and ACSM websites for details. They provide tests in various cities and often have weekend workshops throughout the year you'll need to attend in order to keep your certification current.<br>  <br>  Avoid AFAA since they offer a weekend certification course that a monkey could pass. Not many employers take AFAA seriously. After you've qualified, include it in your resume and start mailing to gyms. Make perosnal visits to gyms you'd like to consider and meet with the director. You can even hand-deliver your resume.|`|WWoWXgMkaa	yes u can cause im a success wellness coach. Im willing to help u in this problem. just email me yani_ratu@yahoo.com.sg ;)|`|rzAjLStTaa	It's not that hard to become a "certified" personal trainer.  The gentleman before is right about AFAA and there are other certs. that I can pass faster than I can run a 1.5 miles.  The tops certifications are ACSM, NSCA, NASM, ACE, and maybe ISSA.  You go to their website and enroll for the cert. and they will send you study materials after you pay for them.  They give you a time period to take the test.  Most test are computer based multiple choice questions either at a location of their choosing or at your home.  If you want to be a "Qualified" personal trainer, then get those certifications, go to college and take some coursework in kinesiology, and become knowledgable in the areas of psychology, nutrition, and did I say sales?  Yeah, there is the scary part, you will have to deal with sales.  Personal trainers are in high demand, you just got to look around in the local gyms and talk to the manager there.   Just know what you are talking about and show some passion in the field and you will be ok.  Good luck!
HM6J2kjtaa	Sounds like you are doing more exercise than most of us mommies =).  Stick with it.  Its good that you've dropped 6 pounds in a month.  That's probably water weight.  Expect to lose more water weight in the next couple months, another 10 pounds or so, making it a total of 10% loss of original weight.  That's actually good.  Once your body gets adjusted to less retained water in your system, your body will respond to the strenuous exercise regimine you have adopted and start to shed the extra fat, replacing it with lean muscle mass.<br>  <br>  Also, make sure your caloric load is adjusted to make room for more fruit, vegetable, lean protein sources (like chicken), and less bread, desserts, sweets, and red meat.  And of course drink lots of water.  I'm sure you are doing that already.<br>  <br>  I've had 2 kids and still haven't regained my pre-pregnancy figure.  But I haven't been exercising either, unlike you.  At the rate you are going, you probably will exceed your expectations by the time the baby is two years old!

Eyf8EEQTaa	Well at first you'll lose water weight, like 5 pounds of just water. And if your steady and you are burning off more calories then you are talking in then the pounds start melting off ....then the weight loss goes a lil slower again. Your age is a big deal too. The younger the easier. So do it now bc the older you get the harder it is.|`|pYQ8CiBVaa	Losing weight is a simple equation: if you burn more calories than you eat, the weight will come off. Start off by estimating how many calories you burn each day using the calorie calculator <a href="http://straighthealth.com/pages/tools/caloriecalclb.html" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com/pages/tools/ca...</a>  This will give you an idea of how many calories to eat. Healthy weight loss is 1-2 pounds per week. To lose 1 pound per week you need to create a calorie deficit (burn more than you eat) of 500 calories per day. To lose 2 pounds a week, you have to double the deficit to 1000 calories per day. You can achieve this by eating less, exercising more or a combination of both.<br>  <br>  Guide to Dieting - <a href="http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/dieting.html" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/d...</a><br>  The 9 Week Straight Diet - <a href="http://straightdiet.com" rel="nofollow">http://straightdiet.com</a><br>  Health, Exercise and Diets - <a href="http://straighthealth.com" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com</a>|`|CObBAzKtaa	once you've stepped on that weight machine, it just somes too you|`|ulNwWujhaa	It varies from body to body some people gain while others lose.

AA11118886	If you understand that a concussion is SWELLING OF THE BRAIN.  That means that her brain is under pressure against her scull.  SO YES,  She will definitely feel differently until the brain swelling is gone.<br>  <br>  FOR GOSH SAKES IT HAS ONLY BE TWO WEEKS. DO NOT ALLOW HER TO STRESS, THAT WILL MAKE HER MUCH WORSE.<br>  <br>  Have her to prepare a full explanation to go with all college admissions to explain what happened and might cause any change in her GPA . They will clearly be able to see the change from her grade history, if there is any. <br>  <br>  YES The change should absolutely be temporary, unless she has internal brain damage that has not been discovered.<br>  <br>  Encourage her to rest and be peaceful.  The more distressed she is the longer and worse her recovery will be.<br>  <br>  Ibuprofen is excellent for swelling and inflammation,  But consider her taking 2 Excedrin  Max strength on the alternate four hours.  It actually kills headache pain much  better.  I would strongly suggest ice packs on the back of her neck to cool the blood flow to the brain and it will assist in cooling the brain tissue to reduce swelling.  Ice packs on the back of the neck always work well for migraines.<br>  <br>  God Bless and take care.|`|H2h1XRbCaa	I think that I would def go and see a doctor again (take her) <br>  it seems like she may have had more brain damage than what he thinks.....or she may have some swelling that is causing the headaches.|`|6ac318a0d5cf80ed85ecf3a1a7c192a0aa	usually if you get a concussion, the first few days are the worst days of pain and confusion.

If she's not having any issues with it, it seems that her cycle is just shorter than most.<br>  <br>  However, if she's unhappy or concerned, I'd suggest going to see a gynocologist, just to make sure that everything is ok, and to see what options she has if she'd like to go on hormonal birth control to elongate her cycles.<br>  <br>  Wish her luck!<br>  <br>  -Essin' Em, hotmoviesforher.com|`|eRyVH2wMaa	as long as she gets it once a month|`|JKSR4f3vaa	is she still in her teens?  a lot of teens have very irregular periods.

If you don't lose weight it might have to do with the things you eat that are vegeterian, like candy, or fatty carbohydrates. YOu must eat at least 5 times a day in small portions, you have probably heard that before right? Try excercising in the morning for 30 min on a stationary bike at a fat burning heart rate level. Then eat oatmeal with soy milk since your vegeterian, have an apple 3 hours after your breakfast, then 1 hour later have lunch like mashed potatoes and vegetebles or soy meat if you eat any I DO YUM!!

Turn off any TV sets or other noisy appliances. Some soft, relaxing music is okay, but it isn't necessary. Make sure your cellphone is off. <br>  <br>  Sit on a chair or a cushion. You don't have to twist your limbs into the lotus position or adopt any unusual postures (but you can if it's comfortable). <br>  <br>  Close your eyes or find something else calm to look at. You may want to use a small candle flame. <br>  <br>  Take care to sit erect, allowing for free and easy breathing. This will happen naturally when your knees are below the level of your waist. Don't try lying down; most people will fall asleep meditating in this position. <br>  <br>  Observe your breath. Don't try to change the way you are breathing, just let your attention rest on the flow of your breath. The goal is to allow the "chattering" in your mind to gradually fade away. <br>  <br>  Relax every muscle in your body. Don't rush this, as it takes time to fully relax, and relax bit by bit, starting at your toes, and working up to your head. <br>  <br>  Mentally focus on words that appeal to your linguistic style. If you are visual, use words that evoke pictures. If you are auditory, use words that evoke sound. If you are kinesthetic, use words that evoke feelings. <br>  <br>  Repeat these words to yourself to encourage the outcome that you desire. For example, repeat to yourself how relaxed you are by saying "I am completely relaxed." <br>  <br>  Visualize a place that calms you. It can be real or imaginary. This step can replace word repetition, augment it or be excluded from your meditation. One option is to imagine you are at the top of a staircase leading to a peaceful place. <br>  <br>  Count your way down the steps until you are peaceful and relaxed.|`|H7hwiGNAaa	Place your rightleg over your left leg in the lotust position (indian). Then intertwine your fingers, lightly resting your thumbs against eachother. Hold a straight back, but not stiff. Finally let your eyes relax (open makes you mind too alert but closed shuts it). As you sit there breathe, and you may feel like it is busying you mind, however it is just makeing you realize how active your mind really is. Soon you should start to feel wholesome and relaxed, letting your mind cleanse.

jOu7WtR8aa	Your breasts sit on top of sternal pectoral muscle. Targeting those muscles will lift the breasts and make them appear larger, even if you do lose the fat through cardio exercise (your body will decide where it burns its fat). That's not to say you'll build "pecs"... that takes a lot of effort and testosterone for a female to accomplish. But toning the muscle underneath will retain the appearance of size while still allowing you to burn fat.|`|Tc6KXEpjaa	congrats on the increase! i've gained like 4kg without much increase in bust size. n i cant lose those EXTRA pounds. i think your bust will be affected cos losing weight thru excercise n diet affects the entire body. probably the alternative is to try those slimming centres but im not sure if it will work very well|`|zCmY8jLDaa	There isn't too much you can do about that. You can try to build your chest muscles to replace the fat but you can't build muscle anywhere near as fast as losing fat.<br>  <br>  When we want to get rid of body fat, there is no way to specifically burn fat from one part of the body. Doing situps won't burn the fat that is covering your abs and doing tricep extensions won't get rid of the fat that is covering your triceps. The only thing you can do is lose weight all around and eventually the problem area will also improve. The way to burn fat is through a calorie restricted diet in conjunction with an exercise routine that will burn calories. Activities that burn calories include running, biking, swimming and other high intensity activities.<br>  <br>  Guide to Reducing Body Fat - <a href="http://www.straighthealth.com/pages/guides/reducebodyfat.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.straighthealth.com/pages/guid...</a>

PoQLoQrlaa	il n'y a pas lieu de consulter chez le gynéco à tout bout de champs!!!<br>  mais il y a certaines consultations à faire tout au début de la vie sexuelle: prendre le premier contact, savoir quelle pilule prendre, prendre des renseignements concernant la pilule du lendemain, renseignements sur les IST et le SIDA, le frottis du col et surtout l'apprentissage de l'autopalpation des seins pour le dépistage du cancer du sein...<br>  Puis aprés cela on n'est pas obligé d'y aller tout le temps, mais au moindre pépin il ne faut pas hésiter.|`|0WNTKfQHaa	il y a des erpes, des irritations, des champignons, des pertes, des rougeurs,des diamands oubliés des fois, avec ou sans rapports sexués, ya tjrs le risque des cancer de l'uterus et autres cadeaux de la nature. Et puis faut bien que les gynecos survivent et se rincent l'oeil.

Le frotti est le dépistage du cancer du col de l'utérus fait tous les ans, donc sans rapport avec la vie sexuelle.<br>  Et il y a aussi des mycoses, des irritations, des pertes, des champignons, des verrues...la liste est longue de ce  que tu peux avoir!! 1 fois par an, cela permet de contr?ler que tout va bien, de faire un frottis et plus tard dépister aussi le cancer du sein.|`|LUlsWCSFaa	Parce que le rapport sexuel est source de nombreux risques, plus ou moins graves, pour la femme.<br>   Il n'y a pas que le SIDA. On peut parler notamment du cancer du col de l'uterus ou des mycoses vaginales : le préservatif ne protège pas de ces maladies et désagréments !<br>  <br>  La visite chez le gynéco permet de prendre le mal à sa source, si mal il  y a, et d'éviter des problèmes par la suite :le tout pour continuer d'avoir une sexualité épanouie et saine !
JVk73pVzaa	I would have a doctor look at it.  You may have fractured a bone in your face which would be the reason that you keep irritating it.  Sorry you got kicked.  That sucks!  Feel better though!|`|yMXWrhL4aa	It is pretty normal.  It will continue to be very sensitive and swell up easily until it fully heals.  That will probably take 2 or 3 weeks.  You should go to see a doctor if it begins to turn very red and stays that way for over 3 or 4 days.  This could be a sign of infection.
AA12266619	Remember, that life (not just urs but every1 else's too) just goes on. U can't be perfect. And that there's a limit to which we can make things happen the way we want (including how u want to feel). In which case, one should stop trying to make a difference. Afterall, what's the point in a life that could be totally controlled?<br>  <br>  Hope to see a better u. Bye. TC.|`|sfEMRwRWaa	goto the doctor, get meds, duhhhhhhhhhhh|`|J9DBtX49aa	you are probably really sad. you may be depressed, i am no doctor, but it doesn't take on to see you are sad.

I'm sorry your family wasn't as supportive as you hoped them to be. Your friends aren't being bad friends...they just don't know how to help. <br>  <br>  I suggest trying therapy or counseling to see if there's any advice/support they can dispense that you haven't tried yet, and then maybe try some anti-anxiety meds.<br>  <br>  I think support groups are very important, and depending how you feel about live, in-person groups, this may be a good resource for you. DailyStrength is a great site that connects users with like-minded people that are facing the same life challenges or medical issues. You can easily find lots of people dealing with anxiety and depression, and see how they cope. I've had anxiety for over 8 years, and still battle forward with it every day. I keep a wellness journal on the site which helps me keep my anger and rampant thoughts in check. I think it's worth a try. Best of luck to you. :)|`|SeOLzvfFaa	I feel the same way sometimes.

You will be surprised what lifting weights can do for your libido not to mention stamina.  Get your heart rate up when exercising.  <br>  <br>  Add some spices to your meals, eat some spicy food or add hot sauces.  This can help your drive.

AA10945320	Good luck! :)<br>  Go with the Food Pyramid...it's a great reference for how to eat.  Get in the habit of eating fruits/veggies at meals BEFORE the carbs.  Stick with chicken & fish for meats (cut back on the beef/pork).  TONS of water...seriously, this is key...8-10 8 oz glasses per day at a minimum.<br>  I just joined Curves (not sure if you have in your area), I think you could have 2 left feet & do that...it's fairly reasonable (compared to gym memberships) and I enjoy working out with other women who don't look perfect in their spandex! :)<br>  Walking (briskly, could carry hand weights too) would also be a great option for someone who isn't very athletic.  Walk with your mom, enjoy the time & then you can set the pace. <br>  <br>  As far as your patience goes...take a deep breath, it's your mom & you love her, as long as she's trying keep encouragine.  Positive encouragement will take her a lot further than you being unhappy with her not working hard enough.  SUPPORT, SUPPORT, SUPPORT...remind her of the benefits she'll see with weight loss (increased energy, less health issues, etc.).  They're even linking some CANCER to obesity in latest studies...if that isn't motivation, I don't know what is!!<br>  If you get frusterated, step back, tell her you love her & you want what's best for her and you'd love to go for a walk!<br>  Good luck & congrats to your mom.|`|AA10423733	If you want to get her more athletic try just walking with her everyday.

Put in her height, weight, activity level, age, and it will give what she is supposed to be eating for the rest of her life.  Keeping in mind you have to reduce calories by 25 a day every year after you hit 35/40.  <br>  <br>  They also have some ideas for activity.   What they suggest are doable  for the AVERAGE person.      You need to remember she needs to develop a routine that she can live with not just to get to 150 - but to get her ideal weight AND STAY THERE.|`|W3k2dMwGaa	Ok.  The Food Pyramid advice is good.<br>  <br>  Please bear in mind she is unlikely to lose that much in two months.  Between 8 and 16 pounds is more realistic in that timeframe.  Setting achievable goals is important so she doesn't lose hope and give up.

wf3OzzVgaa	I have had a lift and silicone implants. It was about 9 months ago. The first week is the hardest! You will need alot of help. You can't really raise your arms or lift anything. Not to mention you will be doped up from the pain killers. Which are wonderful by the way. It is painful but it does not last forever and the results are so amazing. You will come home with dressings or tape on your breast. You go back to have them removed. At first the scars are pretty nasty but over time fade very well. It has only been 9 months for me but I am impressed with the results. In about a month you will be back to your normal routine. In about 4-6 weeks the swelling will be gone. In about 3-4 months they will drop down to the new position where they should sit. Don't buy any new bras until 3-4 months have passed. Just use sports bras in the meantime. They will feel very heavy and tight at first. Recovery is different in different people I am sure but this was my experience. I have two small children who needed me and a job that was pressuring me to come back to work. I also had classes to go to at night. I didn't get alot of downtime. Just make sure you have plans to do NOTHING for about a week. Good luck--don't be nervous. You can email me if you want.|`|d44c3f0b4f683dcf3be857a77fe7f4b2aa	nope, never had one.|`|gribxNJkaa	Well I have and I'm not going to lie it hurs but when it stops hurting it looks AMAZING . You should expect antibiotics and pain killers after recovery but truely the doctors won't be able to help much its a process of time and only time will help it heal also it is really painful after you had the operation but trust me its worth it you get the best boob lift with them !! It will take around 1 month until it doesnt hurt much and you will be back normal in around 3 months so you will be able to do everything normal then You welcome..<br>  HOPE I HELPED<br>  LIZZIE XX<br>  <br>  boob sisters lol! :)

NTLZtbyiaa	food blocks <a href="http://www.drsears.com/foodblockguide.page" rel="nofollow">http://www.drsears.com/foodblockguide.pa...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  1.   Fat<br>  At every meal, you must eat an adequate amount of good fats. Good fats include Omega-3 EPA/DHA concentrates and monounsaturated fats like extra virgin olive oil. Bad fats include trans fatty acids found in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils and Arachidonic Acid (AA) found in fatty red meats and egg yolks.<br>   <br>  2.   Protein<br>  To keep your insulin levels in the Zone at every meal, you must always consume adequate amounts of low-fat protein (about the size of the palm of your hand or about 3 ounces for most females and 4 ounces for most males). A typical snack contains 1 ounce of protein for both women and men. The best protein sources are skinless chicken, fish, turkey, lean cuts of meat, low-fat dairy products, egg whites, protein powder and soy meat substitutes. <br>   <br>  3.   Carbohydrates <br>  In addition to good fats and protein, you must also eat carbohydrates at every meal and snack. However, not all carbohydrates have the same effect on insulin levels. Starches (like pasta, potatoes and bread), grains and rice elevate insulin levels too much, whereas, most vegetables and fruits do not spike insulin levels (a few exceptions are corn, peas, bananas and dried fruits). While this doesn’t mean you have to completely eliminate starches, grains and rice from your diet, you must eat much smaller quantities of them compared to your intake of vegetables and fruits. <br>   <br>  It’s as easy as 1, 2, 3.<br>  The Zone 1-2-3 Method makes it simple to determine the fat, protein and carbohydrate content of every meal and snack.

La plupart des grains de beauté sont sans danger. Il s'agit des naevus ou grains de beauté bénins. Faiblement présents à la naissance, ils apparaissent dès l'enfance jusu'à l'age de 30 ans environ. Ce sont des taches rondes ou ovales, planes ou en relief, de contour nets, de coloration homogène ( 1 ou 2 teintes de bruns ) et de diamètre rarement supérieur à 6 mm. <br>  Peu différents les uns des autres chez une même personne, leur nombre dépend de facteurs héréditaires mais aussi des expositions solaires.<br>  <br>  Transformation au soleil. Les expositions solaires représentent en effet un dangereux agent de transformation du naevus en mélanome qui est le cancer cutané le plus grave. On constate près de 10 à 12 000 nouveaux cas par an en France et sa fréquence ne cesse d'augmenter. Pour la plupart, ils sont dus à des facteurs génétiques. 75% d'entre eux surviennent sur peau libre, sans naevus prééxistant. Les 25% restants proviennent de naevus ayant évolués à cause d'expositions solaires intenses et fréquentes.<br>  <br>  Mais quand faut il s'alarmer ? Lorsque vous remarquez un grain de beauté différent des autres, c'est à dire une tache asymétrique, de bords irréguliers ou flous, de couleur non homogène et au toucher totalement indolore.<br>  Le diagnistic à un stade débutant est une nécessité qui peut s'avérer vitale ( plus de 1000 décès par an ), d'autant que plus celui-ci est précoce, plus les chances de guérison définitives sont importantes.|`|9df7a8dca5593e0c586265d76f3eb9d3aa	C'est possible qu'un grain de beauté pousse, si celà t'inquiète, tu peux consulter un médecin pour vérifier que tout va bien.

NTLZtbyiaa	This might help. <br>  <br>  Food choices   <a href="http://www.drsears.com/foodblockguide.page" rel="nofollow">http://www.drsears.com/foodblockguide.pa...</a><br>  <br>  1.   Fat<br>  At every meal, you must eat an adequate amount of good fats. Good fats include Omega-3 EPA/DHA concentrates and monounsaturated fats like extra virgin olive oil. Bad fats include trans fatty acids found in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils and Arachidonic Acid (AA) found in fatty red meats and egg yolks.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  2.   Protein<br>  To keep your insulin levels in the Zone at every meal, you must always consume adequate amounts of low-fat protein (about the size of the palm of your hand or about 3 ounces for most females and 4 ounces for most males). A typical snack contains 1 ounce of protein for both women and men. The best protein sources are skinless chicken, fish, turkey, lean cuts of meat, low-fat dairy products, egg whites, protein powder and soy meat substitutes.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  3.   Carbohydrates<br>  In addition to good fats and protein, you must also eat carbohydrates at every meal and snack. However, not all carbohydrates have the same effect on insulin levels. Starches (like pasta, potatoes and bread), grains and rice elevate insulin levels too much, whereas, most vegetables and fruits do not spike insulin levels (a few exceptions are corn, peas, bananas and dried fruits). While this doesn’t mean you have to completely eliminate starches, grains and rice from your diet, you must eat much smaller quantities of them compared to your intake of vegetables and fruits.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  It’s as easy as 1, 2, 3.<br>  The Zone 1-2-3 Method makes it simple to determine the fat, protein and carbohydrate content of every meal and snack. For every gram of fat you consume you need to eat twice as many grams of protein and 3 times that amount in grams of carbohydrates.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Meals for Females<br>  At each meal consume approximately:<br>  10 grams of fat<br>  20 grams of protein (2x the fat grams)<br>  30 grams of carbohydrate (3x the fat grams)<br>  <br>  Meals for Males<br>  At each meal consume approximately:<br>  15 grams of fat<br>  30 grams of protein (2x the fat grams)<br>  45 grams of carbohydrate (3x the fat grams)<br>  <br>  Snacks for Females and Males<br>  At each snack consume approximately:<br>  3 grams of fat<br>  6 grams of protein (2x the fat grams)<br>  9 grams of carbohydrate (3x the fat grams)<br>  <br>  The 1-2-3 method is an easy way to make sure you get the right balance of fat, protein and carbohydrates to “turn on” a fat-burning metabolism and satisfy hunger at the same time.<br>  <br>  Remember, the above numbers are approximate. So don’t worry about being 100% precise. Hunger control between meals and how your clothes fit are your best barometers for success.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Timing<br>  Eat a Zone meal or snack within one hour after waking. To keep your insulin levels in the Zone so you are burning stored fat instead of accumulating it, eat every 4 to 6 hours after a meal or 2 to 2?  hours after a snack (including one at bedtime), whether you are hungry or not.<br>  <br>  Liquid<br>  Drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day.|`|XEcj6iZnaa	Buddy youre getting too skinny, theres no more weight to loose|`|b9d7e1ea8425adc0a8398611a1d49c2caa	I have no idea how tall you are but I think that you don't need to be losing anymore weight.

Don't you want to keep growing? What you need to do is throw away your scale. It is telling you nothing, yet you are giving it complete control of your life.

e6f5d94c97e40bd8daccc0d779635b8aaa	Tumeur bénigne qui se développe aux dépens de méninges : l'arachno?de et la pie mère.<br>  Le méningiome se voit chez l'adulte (un peu plus chez la femme) entre 20 et 60 ans.<br>  <br>  Il semblerait que ces tumeurs soient secondaires à la perte d'un élément appelé anti-oncogène situé sur le chromosome numéro 22. L'absence de cet élément favoriserait la survenue de tumeur.<br>  <br>  D'autre part, les méningiomes s'observent plus fréquemment chez les femmes présentant un cancer du sein.<br>  <br>  Enfin, ils ont un rapport direct avec des récepteurs pour les hormones comme les oestrogènes et la progestérone.<br>  <br>  Leur localisation se fait préférentiellement au niveau de la ligne médiane du cerveau, qu'on appelle la faux du cerveau.<br>  <br>  Leur classification est complexe, il existe en fait 7 subdivisions qui sont les suivantes :<br>  <br>  Syncytial. <br>  Transitionnel. <br>  Fibroblastique. <br>  Micro-kystique. <br>  Psammomateux. <br>  Angioblastique. <br>  Malin. <br>  Anatomie<br>  Les méninges sont les enveloppes qui protègent le système nerveux central (cerveau et moelle épinière). Elles sont au nombre de 3 : l'arachno?de, la pie-mère et la dure-mère.<br>  <br>  La dure-mère est située directement sous le crane. <br>  L'arachno?de est située sous la dure-mère. <br>  La pie-mère recouvre directement la substance nerveuse.<br>  <br>  Physiopathologie<br>  Le méningiome repousse le tissu nerveux (le cerveau et la moelle épinière elle-même) situé au-dessous de lui sans l'envahir, c'est-à-dire sans se "mêler " avec lui. <br>  <br>  Son évolution est très lente et peut s'étendre sur plusieurs mois voire des années.<br>  Sympt?mes<br>  1 - Quand ils sont situés dans le crane, les méningiomes entra?nent :<br>  <br>  Une paresthésie (trouble de la sensibilité, anesthésie légère) pouvant aller jusqu'à la paralysie. <br>  Des céphalées. <br>  Des troubles de la vue plus ou moins importants. <br>  Des vomissements. <br>  Des crises d'épilepsie.<br>  <br>  2 - Quand ils sont situés dans la colonne vertébrale, ils sont susceptibles de provoquer une compression de la moelle épinière qui entra?ne :<br>  <br>  Des douleurs dans les membres. <br>  Des paresthésies pouvant aller jusqu'à la paralysie. <br>  Des troubles des réflexes. <br>  Une sensibilité modifiée pouvant aller jusqu'à une abolition de la sensibilité dans une partie de l'organisme. <br>  Examens Complémentaires<br>  La radiographie des artères du cerveau avec préparation permet, dans certains cas, de mettre en évidence la tumeur.<br>  <br>  La radiographie des méninges après une préparation particulière peut également aider au diagnostic. Les méningiomes peuvent aussi parfois se développer dans les ventricules cérébraux, étant alors impossibles à distinguer des papillomes des plexus choro?des sur les examens radiographiques.<br>  <br>  C'est le scanner et l'IRM (avec une technique au gadolinium DTPA) qui permettent de confirmer le diagnostic.<br>  Traitement<br>  Il consiste en l'ablation chirurgicale de la tumeur.<br>  <br>  Le type de traitement chirurgical va dépendre de la localisation du méningiome.<br>  <br>  Les tumeurs situées à l'intérieur d'un ventricule cérébral sont habituellement résécables (on peut les enlever), et leur récidive est rare.<br>  <br>  Les méningiomes situés au niveau du trou occipital (en arrière et en bas du crane) peuvent être complètement réséqués en utilisant des techniques de microchirurgie.<br>  <br>  Par ailleurs l'utilisation de la radiothérapie (technique des faisceaux très focalisés) est indiquée pour les méningiomes malins ou pour ceux qui sont incomplètement enlevés.<br>  <br>  Une étude est en cours de réalisation en ce qui concerne l'utilisation des hormones comme les ?strogènes et la progestérone.<br>  <br>  Enfin, les antiémétiques (médicaments empêchant de vomir) et les antiépileptiques sont parfois d'un apport intéressant.|`|58047c6d4998dca7c71f056d3b965492aa	C'est une tumeur  <br>  Va sur  forum meningiome.|`|LAZRQ86uaa	<a href="http://www.vulgaris-medical.com/encyclopedie/meningiome-2994.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vulgaris-medical.com/encyclop...</a>|`|YCrRhMMhaa	Le méningiome est une tumeur cérébrale primitive bénigne de la femme mure et les sympt?mes sont ceux de l'épilepsie.

But don't only eat vegetables. Start every meal with veggies & salad ( without dressing ). This way you fill your stomach with low carb food.  Fruits are ok too. But they have more calories - because of the sugar.    Things you should not eat. Fried stuff & sweet drinks.

Focus on superfoods, lots of protein, green leafy vegetables, foods with fiber, and lots of water.  Stay away from high carb foods like potatoes, pasta, ceral, etc.    Check out the following website to determine your basic metabolic rate (BMR), which will give you a guide to how many calories to eat per day. Then adjust this figure based on the amount of exercise you get per day.|`|1zNfZEDdaa	I was 126 pounds at the end of volleyball season. I'm 5'6". So i reduced what I ate and continued to work out, i never drink anything but water and occasionally a little milk on my fruit or something.   Here's my plan:  Two raw meals a day, (fruit with milk over it, or just fruit, or veggies.)   Then for dinner I eat normal and try not to go back for seconds. (NO DESSERT DURING THE WEEK! unless it's a party or birthday) On the weekend I eat the same, unless I go to a party with friends or something, then I will not worry about it and pretty much eat what i want, but i still only drink water.)   --So fruit for breakfast  --Fruit or veggies for lunch (I can't hardly stand raw veggies so I'll stir fry it ((no oil)) or I'll steam them.)  --For dinner i eat what the family is eating (unless it's beef or pig or fish bc I'm pollotarian.)   Work out everyday even if its just a little.    TIPS:  --Fruit is very low calorie bc of the high water content. If you need a snack eat some fruit.   --If you have alot of carby foods for dinner trade one for another. ((If there's potatoes don't eat bread, If there's pasta don't eat bread...or eat bread and don't eat potatoes... etc. ))  -- Frozen bananas with milk on it tastes like icecream... go for it!!  --Gum gets me through afternoons to dinner... it's something to chew on and makes me distracted if I'm super hungry.   --If you're at a party or if it's a special day, or if your friends are taking you out to eat you can try to be healthy but really don't toture yourself... get the hamburger...or the sundae, or eat the puppy chow and no bake cookies on the table. Or whatever it is you want... but try hard to stay away from fried things no matter what!! (like fries and potatoe chips.)    I'm now 118 pounds and still going!!!

I'm 13 in a few days and Im going through the same thing as you. Youve gotta burn more calories than you eat, or else they change into fat, making you put on weight. Because of this, you need to eat less calories. Im not saying to starve yourself, but cut out bad stuff. Dont eat chocolate. I know it sounds hard, but once you dont eat it for a few days, you dont crave it anymore. Just hang in there. Instead of eating crisps (which is a big thing for me!), I eat salt and vinegar rice cakes. They taste good and dont have many calories in.

oy7mNHJNaa	First thing would be to check if you can still feel your IUD strings.  If you can't find them you should check in with your doctor.  They will usually want to do an ultrasound to determine if the IUD is still in place.  Sometimes it falls out when women are having a bowel movement and we don't even know it.    It could also have reverted into your uterus if you can't find the strings.  Good luck!|`|jeztbF6naa	sorry but whats an IUD?|`|YVVK3ELTaa	Just check the strings are still there, or get your partner to :)  I heard one girl found hers under her bed covered in fluff lol  So it is kinda important to check theyre still there for safety, even if the though of looking for two strings does kinda gross you out :)  xx

k4YVdshkaa	Doctors and reserachers did not know what it was.  It was originally identified because many homosexual men were exhibiting a rare form of cancer (it is now known that the cancer was being caused as a side effect of AIDS).  There is confusion, and a lack of general understanding within the medical community.  The disease can affect individuals differently so it was hard to follow.  No one knew how exactly it was spread, but at first it appeared to be only within the homosexual community, it spread quickly outside of that community and was discovered to be spread through blood products.    History shows that the medical community was slow to react, and it is often assumed that this is because it originally affected only homosexuals, but hind sight is 20/20 so it is really very hard to say.|`|2y3rFvZIaa	It was thought that HIV/AIDS was a gay disease, it was called GRIDS and the government was not in a big hurry to do anything about it.|`|Rd3IivxCaa	we didn't do nearly enough to quarentine the homosexuals and brand their foreheads with the letter "A".

Only homos and death go hand in hand.|`|VnRECJJxaa	It was originally thought to only affect gay people and was actually called GRID-gay related immunal deficiency|`|9TyEDcRzaa	A serious situation they needed to do some thing --- and to days advancement in the knowledge of producing vaccine|`|gSo4dR7oaa	People didn't know what it was, but since it was originally only seen in  gay men, it was thought that that was the only risk factor.  Then it was seen in IV drug users. There was a lot of fear.  Many people thought that HIV could be transmitted by casual contact.  Eventually, doctors and researchers learned how HIV can and can not be transmitted, and that ANYONE can get HIV if they engage in risky behavior.    A great film from the 80's, which demonstrated many of the problems that gay men who had HIV faced,  and many of the stereotypes and fears of people at that time, is called "An Early Frost".  Another great film about HIV and discrimination, made in the 90's, is "Philadelphia".|`|2JeCyjF8aa	It started when the government suddenly "discovered" it, and never provided any proof, of course the government wouldnt lie...would they?

N4JUrdbsaa	Firstly, it is NOT up to anyone besides you to decide whether you're "fat" or not, and that means ignoring the influences of others.

I know two products that could help you with this.  Cylapril or Green Tea Supreme.  Cylapril works specifically with your adrenal gland to detoxify your body, helping food escape the body before it absorbs in excess.  It also helps to boost your mood and performance.  Green Tea Supreme is a pill that has high amounts of Green Tea in it.  It assists with mentally focusing and helps give more energy.  Both of these products are found on diettrials.info.  They are both fewer than FIVE dollars for a two week trial!  If you don't find that you like them, there are many other options for someone like you!|`|DzyCjYToaa	push yourself every time. and try and build up a sweat. the longer your heart pumps faster for the  more weight you lose.    maybe you could try different exercises alongside running.|`|dpCsTIEIaa	you can cut back on carbs such as breads and sweets.

ZR8htpB5aa	Dry socket is extremely painful.. but it does hurt up to your ears.. it sounds like you either are about to get the worst of dry socket or you are just very sensitive to your extraction and causing pain. I would check your dentist just incase to see what is going on. Especially about the nasty taste in your mouth.    Only then will you know if you need any furthur treatments to see if something is wrong. :)    GL!|`|1nINGDC7aa	Dry socket cannot occur so soon. It is because of food impaction in the extraction socket. Try to maintain good oral hyg. Do warm saline rinses 2-3 times a day and this will take care of this.

Until then, I would try using a humidifier in the room to help keep your airways moist while you sleep.  Try propping up with some extra pillows to aid with your comfort.      Only 4 more weeks to go, but I know it seems like forever at that point.  I hope you can kind some relief to help you through.

No soy ningún experto; sin embargo, yo tuve ciertos problemas similares que tú: A mí también me daban dolores de mandíbula y se me tensaba bastante la parte baja de la cara, pero de ahí a que me costara respirar y que me doliera la caja torácica, no. Lo que me pasaba es que las muelas del juicio me estorbaban demasiado, a tal punto que cualquier movimiento que hiciera que involucrara la cabeza hacía que me doliera. Mejor opté por sacarme las cuatro muelas y asunto arreglado.

RFhkPOiBaa	La obesidad sólo es debida a trastornos del sistema endocrino en contadas ocasiones. En la mayor parte de los casos, la obesidad es la consecuencia de un aporte de energía a través de los alimentos que supera al consumo de energía a través de la actividad; este exceso de calorías se almacena en el cuerpo en forma de grasa. Sin embargo, el metabolismo basal, la mínima cantidad de energía necesaria para mantener las actividades corporales, varía de una persona a otra, de manera que hay personas que utilizan, de manera natural, más calorías para mantener la actividad corporal normal. La obesidad puede también deberse a la falta de actividad, como sucede en las personas sedentarias o postradas en cama.<br>  <br>  En el desarrollo de la obesidad influyen diversos factores, además de los que ya se han mencionado, como factores genéticos, o factores ambientales y psicológicos. Se ha observado que hijos adoptados con padres biológicos obesos tienden a tener problemas de sobrepeso aunque sus padres adoptivos no sean obesos. Sin embargo, todavía no está claro cómo los genes influyen en la obesidad. Estudios realizados en ratones pusieron de manifiesto que cuando determinados genes faltaban o estaban mutados se facilitaba el desarrollo de la obesidad. Sin embargo, estas investigaciones no han tenido el mismo resultado en humanos. Por otro lado, los hábitos alimentarios familiares y sociales también tienen importancia y muchas veces se recurre a una ingesta excesiva de comida en situaciones de estrés y ansiedad.|`|7fe9f82fc56fd122e0e31bce66bcd2a3aa	dé CIERTA MANERA SI YA QUE SI TU MAMA ES GORDA SIEMPRE COCINA CON GRASA Y TE PONE BASTANTE, SI ANDAS CON UNA AMIGA Y A CADA MOMENTO COME Y TE DA  DE LO QUE COMES TE CONTAGIAS Y TE PONES  GORDA . pERO SI TU LE DICES MAMA  YO PREPARO MI COMIDA  ESTOY EN DIETA  Y A TU AMIGA MIRA ME ESTOY CUIDANDO COME PERO TE QUIERO MUCHO PERO NO ME DES  ME CUIDO POR MI SALUD.|`|AA10492394	"una manzana podrida echa a perder a las demas", suena cruel pero adquirir los malos habitos de los demas te puede perjudicar|`|hhHNk0G7aa	esta  página  te  puede  ayudar  <br>  suerte <br>  <a href="http://www.genciencia.com/2006/01/31-la-obesidad-contagiosa" rel="nofollow">http://www.genciencia.com/2006/01/31-la-...</a><br>  es  solo un articulo, ver  para  creer|`|nk6qXCQvaa	CLARO QUE NO Y MEJOR ME VOY DE AQUI ANTES DE QUE SE ME PEGUE LO BRUTO JEJEJEJE<br>  <br>  SALUDOS|`|0jWLDh1caa	no es contagiosa ; si comes mucho  solo podes engordar, eso si cuando ves a una persona obesa te matas de la risa , esta si puede ser contagiosa.... ja..|`|1ia3GR13aa	Pues no! quien te dijo esa mentira?! la obesidad como debes saber es un problema de peso que tiene muchas causas... si no quieres contagiarte (jijiji) debes preocuparte por lo que consumes y recuerda tener buena el autoestima =P de verdad ayuda|`|2mqxKwPtaa	No, solo pesada.<br>  Saludos|`|4rLpwjbXaa	La obesidad no es contagiosa porque no es una enfermedad que puede ser contagiada solamente la sufre aquel que debe tener algo que hace que lo que coma lo asimile tanto que le produce adiposidad pero es imposible que esa conformación natural sea contagiosa|`|82eCh8puaa	puess e leido en algunas revistas i dicen k si<br>  <br>  <br>  que si una amiga tuya es obesa i  estas mucho con ella Se te pega i empiezaz a engordar tu tambien...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  la verdad  no lo sE pero eso es lo k dicen varias revistas..<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  sUERTe...|`|LGoYbASbaa	no|`|Mp0yQsQ7aa	para nada!!! de donde sacas esas cosas???|`|iwCFyyrdaa	pienso que si en mi trabajo tenia una compa?era que siempre comía mucho y me ofrecía  y también comía con ella|`|NZc8f225aa	JAJAJAJAJAJA NO PARA NADA, YO TENGO OBESIDAD Y MIS HERMANOS QUE HAN VIVIDO CON MIGO TODA LA VIDA SON SUPER DELGADOSSSSSSSSS, ASI QUE NO.

L'acouphène peut subvenir à n'importe quel age,  mais semble appara?tre essentiellement dans la deuxième partie de la vie, après 60 ans. En effet, il accompagne souvent la perte auditive sur les hautes fréquences liée au vieillissement (presbyacousie).<br>  Le traitement des acouphènes est complexe et varié faisant appel à de différentes techniques: <br>  1. Occlusodontie (orthèses correctrices de l’occlusion) <br>  2. L’orthodontie (correction de l’emplacement dentaire) <br>  3. La restauration dentaire prothétique (remplacements de dents manquantes) <br>  4. L’ostéopathie<br>  5. Chiropractie<br>  6. Assistance psycothérapeutique<br>  <br>     L’un des traitements qui donne des résultats permettant de diminuer l’intensité et la fréquence des acouphènes, ainsi que leur stabilisation ou leur éradication dans le temps est le REGLAGE DE L’OCCLUSION DENTAIRE par des orthèses dentaires mobiles ou fixes.<br>  Dans tous les cas consultez votre médecin ORL, qui vous conseillera sur les solutions les plus adaptées à votre cas particulier.<br>  <br>  En espérant avoir répondu à ta question…<br>  <br>  Amicalement...|`|1aa40983ab748891280c937914601a6faa	il n'y a pas beaucoup de solutions et s'il en existe, tu les trouveras, pour ton cas particulier chez un oto-rhino...|`|yrKxeFKLaa	Dur dur !!!! il n'y a pas grand choses d'efficaces pour l'instant !|`|6kbrnzrFaa	bonjour<br>  Hélas, il n'y a pas de solution, à part attendre que cela passe,|`|LAZRQ86uaa	je te comprends tout à fait, j'ai le même problème et l'ORL m'a donné plusieurs médicalents différents ( dont du Vastarel) mais aucun n'a jamais fait effet.<br>  cela fait quelques années que ?a dure et par moment c'est insupportable, surtout le soir, un des rares moyens qui m'aide, c'est de lire jusqu'à épuisement et que je m'endorme car quand ma "tête" est occupée généralement j'entends moins mes accouphènes, alors que si je regarde la télé le soir, je suis obligée de monter le son tellement mes accouphènes font du bruit!|`|c2YhYTMbaa	mon mari en a eu un qui a duré 2 mois... il a été voir un ORL qui lui a prescrit un médicament (vastarel) et surtout d'utiliser dans la journée si possible des bouchons d'oreille et/ou un casque antibruit pour reposer le tympan.<br>  consulte au plus vite car c'est très gênant et surtout fatigant (stress, irritabilité...)<br>  <br>  Bon courage|`|UAicTlbfaa	pas évident... tout dépend aussi de l'origine de tes acouphènes<br>  j'en ai dans une oreille depuis 17 ans, à la suite d'une rupture de tympan qui s'est reformé rapidement, mais l'oreille siffle toujours depuis ! je m'y suis habituée et ?a ne me gêne plus depuis longtemps. Au début, je mettais de la musique pour m'endormir, afin de ne pas être obsédée par le sifflement.; peu à peu, je n'y ai plus fait attention. Courage ! dans le pire des cas, on finit par s'y faire ; sinon, dans la plupart des cas, ils disparaissent d'eux-même|`|w9aQEyRcaa	J'ai cela aussi, mais pas au point de prendre des medoc<br>  J'ai essayé un autre medicament qui va aussi pour le traitement pour le coeur...des pillules rouge, je ne sais plus le nom<br>  Sinon, je crois que tu peux te faire appareiller...c'est un systeme qui t'envoie une meme frequence en opposition...ainsi, ca s'annule !!
1cdaeac926dff459663d60986a9fea42aa	Mate, having a nice flat stomach with abdominal muscle definition requires two things: well-developed abdominal muscles and low body fat levels.<br>  <br>  Everyone has abs -- they are usually just hidden below a layer of stomach fat. Melt away some of the fat and they start to show. However, even then, if you don't exercise your abs, you won't get a ton of definition there.<br>  <br>  So to get that look you want, you'll need to combine diet and exercise (yes, I know you hear that all of the time for every answer, but it really is the magic combination) to get your body fat levels down. At the same time, you want to do some resistance exercises to help build muscle there.<br>  <br>  In terms of body fat levels you should know that men don't typically show good ab definition until they approach 10% body fat -- and they don't get ripped until they are in the single digits. Women will start to see some ab definition as they approach 20% body fat, and it will really pop out at around 14-15%. However, women should not go much lower than 14-15 percent body fat, since it can cause health issues.<br>  <br>  Getting abs is first about diet. Then cardio, then weight training.<br>  <br>  If you are consuming the right amount of calories in the right types of "clean foods" (lots of fresh veggies, lean meats/proteins, good fats, little or no sugar, soda, fast food, etc.) you should be able to start stripping off belly fat IF you combine it with cardio.<br>  <br>  High intensity, interval cardio has been shown to be more effective at reducing abdominal fat than lower-intensity cardio. The good news is that type of cardio requires less time (30 minutes), but it will work your a** off.<br>  <br>  So instead of spending 45 minutes doing brisk walking or a slow jog on a treadmill or elliptical, you alternate periods of fast walking (2 minutes say) with 1 minute of sprinting on the treadmill. You basically keep cycling this for thirty minutes. You can torch a lot of calories this way and it encourages fat burning after exercise. For more details, check out some of the links below (a few of them are to bodybuilding type sites, and one is a commercial site, but the info is very good ... don't let it scare you off.)<br>  <br>  In terms of training your abs, don't fall victim to the idea that more is better. Training abs everyday or doing 50-100 repetitions each time is not necessarily what you need. You also don't need fancy ab machines (they are usually counterproductive.) The abs are like any muscle, they need resistance to grow. So try doing your crunches with a some resistance, like a light dummbell held across your chest, or use a cable to give you some resistance. You'll be able to do less reps, but you will work the muscles harder (you'll also find that they may actually be sore the next day!)<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|KPlJFQioaa	I had done it only in 3 months.<br>  <br>  sits-up 60x a day (30x in the morning + 30x in the late afternoon) 7 days a week.<br>  <br>  if you want faster, you can do more than 60x a day.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|inFp9IdIaa	want to know How Can you  Get A Six Pack you should do some abdominal area exercises for that,its possible quick based on your effect... i think that the below website will help you to find the right solution.|`|mj1bC73gaa	I just bought a six pack of Cooper's Pale Ale - a South Australian beer.

Este tipo de tratamiento se denomina Apipuntura. <br>  Investigadores célebres como Joiriche (Moscú) y el Dr. Saine (Montreal) han constatado las virtudes terapéuticas del veneno de las abejas en forma de picadura provocada. <br>  Existen varias maneras de practicar la apipuntura: colocando la abeja sobre la parte enferma, por ejemplo en gota y reumatismo, como lo hacían Carlomagno e Iván el Terrible. Este tipo de tratamiento se suele aplicar escalonadamente durante varias semanas, alcanzando un total de más de 100 picaduras en total. Una tabla válida sería: <br>  Día 1o................................1 picadura <br>  Día 2o................................2 picaduras. Y así sucesivamente hasta llegar al <br>  Día 10o.............................10 picaduras <br>  Descanso de tres días <br>  Se empieza ahora con tres picaduras cada día durante 10 días. <br>  Tratamientos <br>  El médico ruso Orlov trató en 1969 en el cogreso de Bucarest sobre el veneno de las abejas y su incidencia sobre el sistema nervioso central. Según rezan algunas leyendas muchos casos de peste y cólera fueron curados con picaduras de abeja. Lo que es cierto, es que en la actualidad se ha comprobado su eficacia en casos de bronquitis, bocio exoftálmico y oftalmía. <br>  El veneno de las abejas tiene propiedades revulsivas más rápidas que la harina de mostaza, debido a que es tónico cardíaco, fluidificante de la sangre y vasodilatador (dilata las arterias). <br>  Es muy eficaz contra los reumatismos, la ciática, gota, artritis, neuritis, neuralgias, poliartritis crónica evolutiva y paludismo. <br>  El veneno de la abeja es un tónico general, aumentando el dinamismo del sujeto que se somete a sus picaduras de forma controlada y voluntaria. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.buenasiembra.com.ar/salud/terapiasalterna/apiterapia.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buenasiembra.com.ar/salud/ter...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mundoanuncio.com/anuncio/terapia_con_veneno_de_abejaapiterapia_1151675651.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mundoanuncio.com/anuncio/tera...</a>|`|3dgA6cUzaa	Lo unico que se es que estan tratado casos de artritis no tengo mas conocimiento que este|`|99d0d031b03cfb6aec58f6e3466a203caa	Lo único que puedo decirte es que debe ser una persona muy responsable la que realice el tratamiento, porque nunca se debe olvidar que la apitoxina es veneno.<br>  Se de gente a la cual le fue muy positivo el tratamiento, pero se que hay un porcentaje de gente a la cual no le da igual resultado, las razones no las se, pero el porcentaje de efectividad es más alto del que no.

Find a sport you like and try to get good at it. You will lose weight from alone. My brother once asked me how to lose weight, he was 300 lbs at that time. I told him to do what he likes ( which was soccer ). That icluded running exercises - plyometrics - the right nutrition, technical training etc.    He tried to get good at it and he did.    He lost half of his weight in only 6 month.    Weight Loss is very simple when it's a "SIDE EFFECT"  But it can become difficult if it's the only thing you want.  You don't have to do boring exercises in order to lose weight.|`|i5KeHwkEaa	Using the treadmill and rotating walk/run.( walk 2 minutes, run 2 minutes) this brings your heart rate up and down which is what you need.

PeMpDAbraa	Hormones. I would honestly suggest going to the dr's and see if there is something that they can give you to balance out your period and it should also help the acne.|`|fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	You have pretty much already told us what is wrong with you, a hormonal imbalance, you dont say how old you are though, bare in mind that if you are in your teens all this is perfectly normal and you shouldnt expect this to calm down until you are in your early twenties  but things can be done to help these problems.     You say your period is always delayed and irregular but that means two different things, if it is always delayed then perhaps it is just that you have a longer menstrual cycle then you first thought, not everyone fits to the 28-days and its normal for your cycles to change as your body changes throughout life, its also effected by things such as health, emotional stress and travel. Irregularity can easily be dealt with by take either Evening Primrose Oil or Black Cohosh capsules daily, these help to regulate your hormones which will help regulate your periods as well as help with things such as acne, menstrual cramps and PMS, all of which are avoidable when you know how, you can get these capsules from most health stores, pharmacies or even supermarkets without them costing too much. Clary sage is another option, normally used for cramps it can help with hormonal problems too, it is an essential oil which naturally supports estrogen production and acts on the pituitary gland to help regulate menstrual problems, just used neat or diluted in vegetable oil you massage it into your abdomen.     Some misinformed people will suggest using hormonal birth control, contrary to popular belief this does not regulate your menstrual cycle at all, it's whole purpose is actually to suppress your menstrual cycle, as such your periods may come at regular times but only because they are forced to do so. As well as possible side-effects it has draw backs particularly for someone of your age as this is the perfect age to learn about what is normal for your body to better care for your sexual health  e.g. learning normal discharge during a particular point in your cycle from discharge due to infection. The negatives of hormonal birth control outweigh any positives, unfortunately many doctors still prescribe the pill for menstrual problems as it is easier for them than educating people, suggesting other treatments or investigating the problem further, thus the myth about hormonal birth control regulating menstrual cycles carries on and people continue to make decisions about their body without being informed. Using hormonal birth control for problems such as these is like using an atom bomb to kill a fly, it is total overkill to mess up your whole body just to deal with these few problems. Not to mention that the pill wont actually cure at best it may hide some of these problems but its not an exact science as such the pill cant be used to treat specific hormonal problems, it just doesnt work that way.     You need to know what happens during a menstrual cycle. In a nutshell the Pituitary Gland in your brain starts releasing a hormone called Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), when the levels of this hormone are high it tells your ovaries to start producing eggs. As those eggs grow they produce a hormone called Estrogen, when there is enough of this hormone the Pituitary Gland will stop releasing Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and instead will start releasing Luteinizing Hormone (LH). When the Luteinizing Hormone (LH) is high enough this causes you to ovulate  this is around 12-16 days into your menstrual cycle where a mature egg breaks away from your ovaries and travels down the fallopian tube, awaiting fertilization. Where the egg has been maturing in the ovaries it leaves the little case which housed it, this case breaks down and starts releasing a hormone called Progesterone, this hormone along with Estrogen makes the walls of your uterus plump up so that if you get pregnant it can care for the fertilized egg, but if the egg is not fertilized then the Progesterone stops being released and this results in menstruation  your period! Complicated right? Hell yeah, and that's what is happening every menstrual cycle, it takes time for the release of hormones in the Pituitary Gland to get high enough to bring about a regular menstrual cycle, the same goes for other parts of your reproductive system, if not enough of a hormone is being released in one place then it won't trigger off release of another hormone elsewhere.    It would be worth seeing a doctor just to check that everything is okay, be careful not to let them use the pill as a quick fix, ask for testing to check hormone levels and treatment to treat these problems (if they are in fact problems). As well as using the above methods to regulate hormones improve your diet, there are hundreds of books that will tell you exactly what foods to eat to improve all these things. That is just it, food makes such a massive difference chances are you could treat yourself just by changing your diet a little bit. I would also suggest for the acne look|`|i3pn4jNcaa	nothing is wrong with you. everyones cycle is different. some normal & some irregular. from what your saying i think you should go on birth control pill because it regulated your cycle & it actually clears up break outs :]|`|D2TWz9anaa	Ask your doctor about taking the contraceptive pill, there is one that is particularly good to clear up acne and they all make your periods much more regular.

96mkEwkwaa	ok the ring sucks. i know people who have used it religiously and got pregnant using it. i used it and i sucked it up so far my boyfriend couldnt even get it out and my doctor had to put TONGS into me to get it out. after that failed i got the Implanon. it is good for 3 years, doctor inserts it into the inside of your upper arm....but the problem is that a lot of docs dont want to give Implanon or IUD if you dont already have kids...especially the IUD if you are not in a commited relationship. thats what i wanted after my daughter and my doc flat out told me no because she thought i was not in a lasting relationship(if you sleep with the wrong guy and get an STD it can cause lots of problems with the IUD). but so far i've had the Implanon for 9 months and i havent gotten pregnant but the bad thing is that my period is not regular at all...i dont know if that is from having a baby or from the Implanon...but if you do go with the Ring then that will do awesome, you are good for 3 weeks then you take it out to have your period. it is really good for that. whatever you choose, good luck!|`|UriE3wN6aa	the shot made me gain weight too and i couldnt remember to take my pill everyday so i swtiched to the patch!!|`|5cKoep6uaa	The Mirena IUD...

0lnamekJaa	Remember... There is no "Magic Pill" that will make you happy, full of energy, and thin... That is not possible...    BUT    One antidepressant that works in a way that doesn't automatically cause weight gain and can boost energy levels is Welbutrin XL    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welbutrin    But remember... It may not be a good antidepressant for you... Don't choose a MENTAL HEALTH DRUG based on stupid side effects like weight loss...    Do you want to be hot and crazy or chunky and sane?    Choose a drug based on what you NEED it for... Not for the stupid 'wants'.|`|hBmafVYoaa	Anti-depressants have a range of side effects. One cannot tell which ones they will get. Speak to your doctor.

I was put on an antidepressant that worked like a miracle pill for me, but when my friend was put on the same one, she BECAME suicidal.  Yes, some antidepressants are known to be better or worse for certain side effects, but you really, really need to talk to your doctor.  Explain your concerns to him/her, and ask them to work with you to find the best treatment with the least negative side effects.  Good luck!|`|JYHlPczxaa	Easy (and Sexy) Ways to Lose 50 Pounds a Year      Exercise for 15-20 minutes. If you have a weight problem, chances are you also have a problem with regular exercise. That's probably because you tried to do too much. Just commit to 15 minutes a day. That's not hard at all. And don't do anything intense, especially for the first month. Take it easy -- do a few crunches, a few push ups, jog in place for a few minutes. If you do this every day, you'll burn 100-150 calories, depending on your size and metabolism.      ?  Replace a fatty snack with veggies. Potato chips, fries, anything that's greasy -- those are laden with calories. Fat is the most calorie-filled food type there is. If you eat a snack like this every day, replace it with cut-up carrots, broccoli, celery, or a salad (with low-fat dressing, not anything fatty).      ?  Have sex daily. One of the best exercises there is. Of course, you'll need to do it beyond your usual three minutes. If you can get 15 minutes of sex in a day, you can burn 150 calories. You also might need to find a willing partner. The exercise in the item above might help with that.
XxPhbwNfaa	If you are not using one already, use a Schick or Gillette three blade razor.  They cause less stress, and fewer cuts to the skin.  Use a good quality gel shaving cream.  Go to men's products for the best choices.  The high quality shaving gels make water wetter, helping soften the hair you wish to cut, and providing a slick surface on your skin so the razor only cuts the hair.    Use lots of water with the gel, to agitate it into a froth.  After shaving, use a rubbing alcohol splash, to tighten skin pores and clean the surface of left over soap.      I use after shaves, which are mostly rubbing alcohol, but I doubt you will want to use products designed to make men smell better to women.

Relax....|`|b660924626cca2a8515dff15eb32d895aa	I agree with the previous answer totally, but you should also know this. . . .Fever blisters are a form of herpes, not the genital type. Millions of people have fever blisters. . . That is all true, but when you have a fever blister or cold sore you should not have oral sex with a anyone and you should never let anyone have oral sex with you while they have a fever blister or cold sore either. If you give or get while you or your partner has a fever blister you can give each other herpes on your genitals.

Para esto, es muy recomendable la asistencia a una psicoterapia de grupo, o a un psicólogo. <br>  Cuenta tus problemas a alguien en quien confíes. Así liberarás voluntariamente tu mente de esos problemas, y ésta no tendrá que liberarlos so?ando pesadillas. <br>  Por la noche, si no puedes dormir bien, haz algo alternativo para olvidar la enfermedad o las molestias que causan tus malos sue?os: leer un libro que te guste, pensar en cosas que te gusten, practica alguna de tus aficiones que sea tranquila,... <br>  No intentes hacer todo tu trabajo en un corto período de tiempo. Distribuyelo de forma que no se acumule. De esta forma, no tendrás esa ansiedad que produce tus malos sue?os. Ejemplo: Empieza a estudiar desde principio de curso, para no ponerte tan nervioso en época de exámenes (además, esto mejorará bastante tus notas). <br>  En algunas situaciones no podrás prevenir la situación que produce las pesadillas. Ejemplo: Si una persona a la que querías mucho muere, la única solución es intentar superar la depresión causada. En estas situaciones es más conveniente que intentes resolver tu problema directamente antes que preocuparte por tus pesadillas. <br>  En todo caso, si en un momento concreto no puedes dormir, no intentes forzarte tú mismo a dormir, porque lo más seguro es que no lo consigas. En vez de esto, puedes hacer algo que te guste, que te tranquilice y te haga olvidar lo que hace que no te puedas dormir, hasta que te entre sue?o. Como ejemplo, recuerdo mis sue?os aburridísimos de vez en cuando sobre resultados futbolísticos, pensamientos sin sentido, o un mismo tema repitiendose toda la noche, y éstos dejaban de repetirse durante la noche cuando conseguía encender la luz para hacer, durante 10 ó 15 minutos, otra cosa que me hiciese olvidarlos. <br>  Si estos sue?os se deben a una enfermedad más que a otra cosa, encender la luz no para las pesadillas. Dejarás de tener pesadillas cuando te cures. <br>  Si tus malos sue?os se deben a alguna preocupación, puedes librarte de ellos, bien solucionando el problema que los causa, bien no preocupándote tanto. Puedes conseguir esto último de la siguiente forma: <br>  Quéjate de tus problemas habituales cuando hables con otras personas, para desahogarte. Cuéntales tus problemas. Si no son problemas habituales, cuéntaselos a un amigo íntimo o a alguien que merezca tu confianza. Si no tienes a nadie, puedes escribirnos. Estamos para eso. <br>  Habla frecuentemente sobre tus pesadillas y cuéntaselas a gente en la que confíes. Ríete de lo que sucede en tus pesadillas. <br>  Sé optimista, por ejemplo, riéndote de lo que sue?as. Obviamente, si tus problemas están haciendote mucho de sufrir, será muy dificil que tengas un punto de vista más optimista. <br>  Si no consigues resolver el problema que causa tus pesadillas, puedes controlar tus sue?os hasta cierto grado incluso hasta el punto de divertirte con ellos y utilizarlos para hacer cosas que no puedes hacer en la realidad. <br>  Sea cual sea el tipo de malos sue?os que tengas, vamos a intentar transformarlos en su mismo curso para convertirlos en algo bueno, asumiendo que ningún problema gordo los está causando (el control de sue?os sólo es efectivo si estos sue?os no están siendo provocados por una situación traumática). <br>  Para despertar de tu pesadilla mientras la estás so?ando, debes estar concienciado de que puedes despertar de ella. Tienes que estas preparado antes de ir a la cama, estar seguro de que si sue?as una pesadilla, vas a poder despertar de ella por tu propia voluntad. Esto es, no puedes modificar tus sue?os la primera vez que lo intentes sin más. Para modificarlos en su propio curso, debes estar seguro de que puedes hacerlo, y para estar seguro de ello, debes haber seguido un entrenamiento, resumido en los siguientes puntos: <br>  Aprende a distinguir los sue?os de la realidad. Hay distintos tipos de personas según que sepan o no que están so?ando. <br>  Distingues el sue?o de la realidad, es decir, en la mayoría de tus sue?os sabes que estás so?ando?<br>  no recuerdas tus sue?os o no sue?as?, piensas que no sue?as?. En realidad todos so?amos.<br>  Descubre qué puedes hacer para despertar en el curso de una posible pesadilla. Cada persona puede tener sus propios métodos, por lo que debes averiguar los tuyos. Y esto lo puedes conseguir probando distintos métodos en cada pesadilla hasta que alguno te dé resultado: <br>  Dirígete a toda velocidad hacia los seres que te persiguen o espérales. <br>  Da vueltas sobre ti mismo, haz acrobacias, movimientos bruscos,... De esta forma puedes conseguir moverte en la realidad y despertar debido a ese movimiento. <br>  Grita. <br>  Insulta a quienes te atormentan en tu sue?o, critícales, diles lo feos que son. Piérdeles el miedo y el respeto. <br>  Si tu sue?o transcurre en un sitio cerrado y oscuro, abre las persianas de la habitación. Antes de hacerlo imagina detrás de ellas un bonito día y la calle llena de gente alegre. <br>  Piensa con seguridad que tienes superpoderes. ?Destroza a todos tus enemigos! <br>  Roba el coche que más te guste y escapa, para ir a parar a un sitio que te guste. <br>  Se?alándoles con el dedo, convierte a tus enemigos en tus mejores amigos. <br>  Tírate por un precipicio para despertarte. <br>  Mete tus dedos en los agujeros de un enchufe (también para despertarte).|`|RrWpuC2Oaa	pues si lo mejor es pedir ayuda profesional mi hermana igual tiene pesadillas seguido eh incluso hasta llora pero no se mi mama la voltea de lado ya que ella duerme boca abajo y no se por que  peor se tranquiliza y ya duerme como una angelita =) Pero si mejor ve a pedir ayuda profesional..|`|j0nwFSuzaa	1 cambia la posición la cama hasta encontrar la adecuada <br>  <br>  2 cambiate de casa|`|oX0BPs08aa	toma somniferos o calmantes|`|ytiXJHPraa	busca a Dios, en las noches, él te ayudará, y te quitará todos los males de tu cabecita|`|oJh6CLDDaa	Hay DOS clases de pesadillas:<br>  Las que surgen desde el propio inconsciente y son producto de temores, sugestiones o "reproches" que nos hace el propio inconsciente.<br>  Las que son producidas por entidades imperceptibles a los sentidos físicos y que muchos denominan (sin siquiera saber muy bien qué son) desde "fantasmas" hasta "demonios" pasando por duendes, etc.<br>  <br>  En el caso de que sean de las primeras, basta con un buen psicólogo para que te ayude a comprenderlas y, de ese modo, que dejen de surgir y acosarte.<br>  <br>  Pero en el caso de las segundas... el tema es largo.<br>  En el 99 por ciento de los casos, son entidades atraídas por quien sufre esta clase de acosos, mediante lo que emite tanto desde su pensamiento como sentimientos.

MSL36pBBaa	Ne t'inquiète pas c'est bien que tu ai changé de pillule, Minesse est réputée pour provoquer ce genre de pertes anormales, des fois mêmes les règles peuvent ne plus survenir du tout ou très peu. C'est important de bien lire la notice avant de prende une pillule. Moi j'ai eu trop de problèmes avec les pillules et j'ai encore du mal à trouver celle qui me convient le mieux.<br>  C'est flippant car les effets indésirables sont nombreux :<br>  <br>  - tension des seins<br>  - rareté des règles voire absence de règles pendant ou à l'arrêt du traitement, saignements entre les règles.<br>  - modification de l'humeur incluant la dépression<br>    modification de la libido (modif. du désir sexuel)<br>  - nervosité<br>  - maux de têtes<br>  - acné, augmentation de la pilosité, chute des cheveux<br>  - réactions allergiques<br>  - ...<br>  <br>  A savoir que sur la notice les effets indésirables sont classés en trois catégories :<br>  - Les effets indésirables qui doivent faire arrêter le traitement<br>  - Les effets indésirables qui peuvent necesité un changement de contraceptions<br>  - Les effets indésirables qui ne nécessitent pas d'arrêter le traitement<br>  <br>  Ceux que je t'ai cité font malheureusement partie de la troisième catégorie. C'est horrible de se dire qu'on nous prescrit des pillules qui modifient notre désir sexuel, et qui peuvent nous rendre dépressive.<br>  <br>  Lis bien la notice, car des fois ils te disent que la pillule est faiblement dosée et ce n'est pas le cas. Mon gyneco m'avait dit que Minesse = Minimum Oestrogène.<br>  Il m'a donné la boite mais je l'ai jamais pris... du coup maintenant je me fais avorter.|`|RVr3K5CTaa	Changez de gynéco, elle est incompétente !<br>  <br>  La diane35 n'est pas une pilule contraceptive, c'est un traitement hormonal contre l'acné qui, comme effet secondaire, a un effet contraceptif. Les autres effets secondaires de la Diane 35 impose une prise à court terme et exclusivement dans le cadre de l'acné sévère.<br>  <br>  Les saignements avec prise de pilule sont du spotting et indiquent simplement que vous avez une pilule qui n'est pas assez oestrogénique. Il faut alors changer d'une pilule progestative à une pilule oestro-progestative.<br>  <br>  "Les prescripteurs doivent se rappeler que :<br>  -  Dianette (Diane 35) n’est pas indiqué aux seules fins de la contraception orale.<br>  -  Dianette est un traitement pour les femmes présentant un acné grave qui ne répond pas aux antibiotiques administrés par voie orale, ou atteintes d’hirsutisme modérément grave.<br>  -  L’administration de Dianette devrait être interrompue trois ou quatre cycles menstruels après la disparition complète du trouble faisant l’objet du traitement.<br>  -  L’incidence de la TEV (formation de caillots veineux ou artériels) est plus élevée chez les utilisatrices de Dianette que chez les femmes prenant des COC à faible concentration d’oestrogènes.<br>  -  Dianette est contre-indiqué chez les femmes ayant des antécédents personnels ou familiaux de TEV confirmée ou ayant des troubles connus de thrombose veineuse ou d’embolie.<br>  -  Les femmes atteintes d’acné grave ou d’hirsutisme pourraient présenter un risque accru inhérent de trouble cardio-vasculaire."<br>  <br>  Bravo, webrunner, vous montrez que les visiteurs médicaux sont prets à mentir pour placer un médicament !|`|319ecfa3510285578e3423741ac3f4b5aa	prend la et change de genyco vite va voir un autre qui t ecoute fait faire des analyse pour savoir se qui te convient le mieux|`|GCotLusWaa	retourne voir ta gyneco arrete le traiment pour acnè.|`|LAZRQ86uaa	si ta gyneco t'a prescrit cette pilule alors il faut la prendre !<br>  Une pilule est à la base un contraceptif et certaines ont des fonctions complémentaires comme Diane 35 et ce n'est pas gênant du tout de la prendre si tu n'as pas d'acné ( j'ai déjà été dans ton cas)|`|PYO7gN3aaa	J'ai eu le même soucis que toi l'année dernière, des saignements une semaine avant la date prévue de mes règles sous Minesse.

For the first week you will lose like 5-10 lbs of water/glycogen stores. (don't eat any carbs for a week, and don't pig out)|`|Hku0AlXhaa	Easiest way to lose weight fast and safely is to cut your calorie intake by eating more on fiber, fruits and vegetables. You'll feel full with fewer calories on them. Fruits, vegetables and fibers are packed with nutrients but less on calories. <br>  <br>  I lost 10 pounds in just 2 months using these tips.<br>  <br>  Here are Tips to help speed up your metabolism plus help you lose weight without being miserable. they worked for me =)<br>  <br>  "Taking the time to relax and savor food increases calorie and fat-burning power by up to 30%", mainstains Marc David, author of The Slow Down Diet( Healing Arts Press, 2005).<br>  <br>  The reason: Savoring stimulates the cephalic phase digestive response, or "brain phase" of digestion, which then sets up a slimming chain of events. First, it signals the hypothalamus, the brain's emotion-and-appetite-control center, to trigger the release of the metabolism-reviving thyroid hormone and the pleasure neurochemical cholecystokinin (CCK). In turn, CCK hinders production of the stress hormone cortisol, a known cause of fat accumulation.<br>  <br>  1. Outsmart Snack Attacks for 4 hours and Lose Weight<br>  <br>  Savoring Berries can oustmart snack attacks for 4 hours and help you shed 5% of your body weight in 6 months. The credit goes to dozens of blood sugar stabilizing antioxidants. Bluberries are so packed with them, just a half cup daily can boost your blood levels by 100%.<br>  <br>  2. Fill up on Fiber and Lose Weight Fast<br>  <br>  Fill up on Fiber - Foods rich in fiber will make you feel satisfied and help curb your appetite, helping you to lose weight fast and safely - so make sure to pack your diet with fruits, vegetables and whole grains.<br>  <br>  3. Boost fat-burning metabolic rate by 50% by sipping coffee<br>  <br>  Sipping coffee before a meal can supress appetite by 35%, plus boost fat-burning metabolic rate by 50%, according to extensive research at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. The study-proven dose : 250 mg of caffeine daily, taken either in supplement form or by sipping to cups of coffee or 4 cups of tea.<br>  <br>  4. Lose Weight just by eating Yogurt<br>  <br>  Yogurt is a calcium-rich food. Research links calcium with lower cortisol production, and it has been proven that women who increase they're intake lose up to 40% more weight than calcium avoiders.<br>  <br>  Plus Yogurt has live microorganisms which helps proper digetion and absorption of nutrients we take. Make sure to get yogurts that says "with live microorganisms in labels/packages". <br>  <br>  5. Try this Hunger-Taming Trick<br>  <br>  Cut fat and you'll cut cravings. Consuming a high-fat diet may supress your body's natural satiety signals, according to a new study from Pennsylvania State University. Animals who'd been consuming a diet rich in fat ended up eating 40% more of a high-calorie snack than those on average diets. Keep your fat intake to less than 30% of total calories.<br>  <br>  6. Feel full on less food.<br>  <br>  Apples are rich in pectin, a soluble fiber that slows the digestive process, so you'll feel full on less food.The result: You'll eat just enough food to make you happy, reducing calorie intake.<br>  <br>  7. Studies suggest people pursuing a healthy weight could lose more weight and burn more fat by including 24 ounces a day of low fat or fat-free milk in their reduced-calorie diet, instead of 8 ounces or less.<br>  <br>  8. Speed fat burn with Cranberries. <br>  <br>  The ascorbic acid in cranberries helps thin liver bile, making it easier for the organ to emulsify fat so so it can be quickly flushed out of the system rather than stored in cells.<br>  <br>  9. Boost your protein intake and lose almost a pound a week without hunger. <br>  <br>  You can try protein smoothies. Packed with nutrients and low in calories, smoothies are a fast, easy and great tasting way to achieve good health.<br>  <br>  You can find a wide collection of healthy fruit smoothies at : <a href="http://fruitsmoothierecipe.bravehost.com" rel="nofollow">http://fruitsmoothierecipe.bravehost.com</a><br>  <br>  By boosting your protein intake from the typical 15% of total calories to 30%, you may be able to cut your daily calorie intake by 440-enough to lose almost a pound a week without hunger, according to a recent University of Washigton study. "A high-protein diet appears to fool the brain into thinking you've eaten more than you have," says the study's lead author, Scott Weigle, M.D., a professor of endocrinology at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Stick with lean protein rather than high-fat, artery clogging meat and dairy products. For breakfast, use low-fat milk instead of water in your oatmeal and sprinkle nuts on top. Eat plenty of beans, fish and skinless chicken breast.<br>  <br>  10. To counteract a binge, keep your body's fat-burning furnace running on full blast by drinking Green Tea. <br>  <br>  Green Tea contains caffeine and the antioxidant epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) , which is proven to boost metabolic rate. In fact, in a recent 3 month study, participants who took Green Tea extract lost 4.6% of their body weight without changing their diet. To get the benefit, drink at least 3 cups a day. <br>  <br>  Whenever I ate too much, I just drink green tea and I don't have to worry gaining weight.<br>  <br>  11. Speed weight loss and double energy levels by eating Coconuts.<br>  <br>  This tropical treats contain medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), a unique fat that is shuttled straight to the liver and immediately burned for fuel. Research shows this little detour revs metabolic rate by up to 50%, speeding weight loss and doubling energy levels<br>  <br>  Plus my favorite tip : Before you eat, drink a glass of water. This will help you feel fuller without additional calories (water has no calories). And Satisfy sweet cravings and keep your stomach full longer by eating all-natural fruits. <br>  <br>  More of these Fast Weight Loss Tips Safely from: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.medicalfactsandfallacy.bravehost.com/healthy_eating5.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.medicalfactsandfallacy.braveh...</a> - great tips really <br>  <br>  Others:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://fruitsmoothierecipe.bravehost.com" rel="nofollow">http://fruitsmoothierecipe.bravehost.com</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://all-about-health-and-beauty.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://all-about-health-and-beauty.blogs...</a>

O fumante com mais de 55 anos tem o risco de morte por infarto triplicado.<br>  <br>  - Doen?a Pulmonar Obstrutiva Cr?nica: 85% dos casos de enfisema pulmonar e bronquite cr?nica s?o provocados pelo cigarro. O tabagista tem 10 vezes mais chances de ter Doen?a Pulmonar Obstrutiva Cr?nica.<br>  <br>  - Derrames cerebrais (AVC): 25% atribuídos ao cigarro (o risco é 3 vezes maior do que nos n?o fumantes).<br>  <br>  - Distúrbios da circula??o: má circula??o das pernas s?o mais freqüentes nos tabagistas.<br>  <br>  - Impotência: mais comum entre os fumantes, também por problemas circulatórios.<br>  <br>  - Os fumantes apresentam, ainda, maiores chances de desenvolverem úlceras gástricas, infec??es respiratórias, osteoporose, inflama??o da gengiva, mau hálito, rugas na pele, celulite e catarata.<br>  <br>  Além desses, existem sempre os problemas de natureza social:<br>  <br>  - Sua roupa cheira mal.<br>  - Seu hálito cheira mal.<br>  - Seu quarto, roupa de cama, tudo, cheira a cinzeiro.<br>  - Seu carro, cheira a cigarro apagado...<br>  <br>  E se você for mal educado, e está com amigos comendo ou bebendo em uma pizzaria, por exemplo, quem n?o fuma, tem que aturar o cheiro do seu cigarro enquanto tenta continuar saboreando a pizza que pediu (e que agora está com o aroma do prato misturado com a fuma?a do cigarro).<br>  <br>  ===<br>  <br>  Cada cigarro pode representar 11 minutos a menos de vida. Os fumantes que n?o se sentem estimulados o bastante para abandonar o tabagismo precisam conhecer os resultados de um estudo inédito da Universidade de Bristol, na Gr?-Bretanha. Os cientistas mediram, pela primeira vez, os efeitos do cigarro sobre a expectativa de vida de fumantes do sexo masculino. A pesquisa, publicada na revista médica britanica “British Medical Journal”, fez ainda uma estimativa do número total de cigarros consumidos ao longo da vida de uma pessoa. Se ela fumar cerca de cinco mil cigarros por ano, dos 17 aos 71 anos, terá consumido mais de 311 mil cigarros. A partir desses dados, os cientistas concluíram que um ma?o de 20 cigarros, por exemplo, priva o fumante de três horas e 40 minutos de vida. Duzentos cigarros, de um dia e meio. Diante dessas novas informa??es, será que n?o chegou a hora de concretizar aquela antiga promessa de parar de fumar no novo ano?|`|mfPPIoagaa	Bem, já listaram os males do cigarro.<br>  Impotencia?

Some say high carb. Some say it's how much food. Some say it's how much exercise. But none of these covers the whole picture.<br>  <br>  How to lose weight naturally is not rocket science. It just takes accepting the facts of these seven natural laws of weight loss, plus good old-fashioned stick-to-itiveness.<br>  <br>  <br>  Seven Laws of How to Lose Weight Naturally<br>  <br>  1. Make a commitment to whatever it takes. You not only need to know what to do, you also have to manage yourself in such a way that you do it. If you already knew exactly how to get yourself to lose weight and keep it off, you'd be at your perfect weight right now. Without 100% commitment to do what it takes, your goal has no staying power.<br>  <br>  2. Start from a foundation of happiness. Most people think losing weight will make them happy. But happiness is a mental state that can only be created right now. And nobody wins at any challenge if they're unhappy. So be happy. Accept yourself and your current circumstances and be enthusiastic about the future you're creating.<br>  <br>  3. Design your own healthy diet plan. Natural doesn't mean spontaneous. As a matter of fact, spontaneous gratification is what gets most of us into trouble. Just like managing your time and money, weight management takes planning and organization. To burn more calories than you consume, based on your lifestyle, how are you going to handle the details?<br>  <br>  4. Manage your emotions. Emotional eating is a major reason for failure. We've learned to use sweets, fatty foods and overeating for entertainment, celebration and to sooth and stuff down unpleasant emotions. Come up with a list of other things you enjoy (besides eating). And begin exchanging old bad habits for healthy new ways of enjoyment and soothing.<br>  <br>  5. Find a way to exercise daily. Exercise is healthy and burns calories. It doesn't have to be complicated or extreme. It just has to happen. Decide what kind would be best for you and work it out with your schedule. There are great exercise videos, walking paths and a variety of gyms everywhere. Choose a time and method and make it a regular habit.<br>  <br>  6. Keep a Journal. If you can't measure it, you can't manage it. Studies show the great majority of people who lose weight and keep it off are very aware of what they eat and the calories they consume. Many keep a journal. Research shows those who guess at the amounts, without writing them down (at least in the beginning), grossly underestimate their calories.<br>  <br>  7. Be persistent. Nothing gets accomplished without persistence. Persistence is the only common denominator of all successful people. The story goes that Thomas Edison had 999 failures before he finally invented the light bulb. If you've tried and failed 999 times, learn from your mistakes and do it better next time. The only way to succeed is to persist.<br>  <br>  <--How to Lose Weight Naturally?--><br>  <--<a href="http://www.loseweighthappy.info/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=67&Itemid=62" rel="nofollow">http://www.loseweighthappy.info/index.ph...</a> -->

8535241e66fe6ec2b5573c2093e3a21aaa	Hola amiga.. pienso que mas que "perdonar"tienes que llegar a comprender.. pero no comprender de cualquier forma.. sino con grandeza... para que me entiendas mejor lee este significado de grandeza el cual me ayudo mucho a mi a superar una etapa muy dificil que me toco pasar en mi vida..espero que te ayude y que puedas darte cuenta de muchas cosas que a la final seran para tu propio beneficio......... a continuacion el texto:<br>  <br>  QUE ES GRANDEZA?<br>  La tarea más dura que una persona puede tener es continuar amando a sus semejantes a pesar de todas las razones para no hacerlo. <br>  Y el verdadero indicio de cordura y grandeza es continuar haciéndolo. Para aquel que puede lograr hacer esto, hay esperanza de sobra. Para los que no pueden, sólo existen penas, odio y desesperación. Y estos no son los elementos de los que se compone la grandeza, la cordura o la felicidad. La trampa primordial es ceder a las tentaciones de odiar. Hay gente que le nombra a uno como su verdugo. A veces, para la seguridad de los demás, es necesario actuar, pero no es necesario odiarlos también. Hacer la tarea propia sin enfurecerse con los que intentan obstaculizarte es un signo de grandeza y de cordura, y sólo entonces se puede ser feliz. Tratar de lograr cualquier cualidad deseable en la vida es algo noble. Lo más difícil, y que es necesario lograr, es amar a nuestros semejantes a pesar de todas las tentaciones de hacer lo contrario. Si existe una cualidad de santidad, no es la de perdonar. El "perdón" acepta la maldad del acto. No hay razón para aceptarla. Además, se tiene que calificar como malo el acto para perdonarlo. El "perdón" es un nivel de acción mucho más bajo y es más bien una censura. La verdadera grandeza simplemente rechaza cambiar frente a las acciones contra uno mismo , y una persona grande en verdad, ama a sus semejantes porque los comprende. Después de todo, todos ellos se encuentran en la misma trampa. Algunos están completamente ajenos a esa situación, algunos se han vuelto locos por esa razón, algunos actúan como aquellos que los traicionaron. Pero todos, todos están en la misma trampa:los generales, los barrenderos, los presidentes, los dementes. Actuan como lo hacen porque todos ellos están sometidos a las mismas presiones de este universo. Algunos de nosotros estamos sometidos a esas presiones y aún seguimos haciendo nuestros trabajos. Otros han sucumbido desde hace mucho tiempo y desvarían, torturan y se pavonean como las almas desequilibradas que son. Salvar algunos de ellos es una empresa peligrosa. Al menos podemos comprender el hecho de que la grandeza no tiene su origen en guerras salvajes o en ser conocido. Tiene su origen en ser fiel a tu propia decencia, en seguir ayudando a los demás sin importar lo que hagan, piensen o digan, a pesar de todos los actos salvajes contra uno mismo; en preservar sin cambiar nuestra actitud básica hacia el hombre. La verdadera grandeza depende de la sabiduría total. Actúan com lo hacen porque son lo que son: seres atrapados, aplastados bajo una carga insufrible. Y se han vuelto locos por esta razón y ordenan la demolición de naciones enteras por errores de interpretación, todavía se puede comprender por qué y se puede comprender también el grado de su locura. ? Poque debería alguien cambiar y comenzar a odiar sólo porque otros se hayan descarriados y sus destinos sean demasiado crueles como para poder encararlos ? La justicia, la clemencia, el perdón, son todas ellas virtudes que carecen de importancia frente a la capacidad de no cambiar por la provocación o las exigencias de hacerlo así. Se debe actuar, se debe mantener el orden y la decencia; pero no hace falta odiar o buscar venganza. Es cierto que los seres son frágiles y cometen errores. El hombre es basicamente bueno, pero puede actuar mal. Sólo actua mal cuando los actos que se realizan para el orden y la seguridad de los demás se hacen con odio. O cuando su diciplina sólo se basa en la seguridad propia, sin tener en cuenta la de todos los demás; o peor aún, cuando actúa sólo por gusto a la crueldad. No mantener ninguna clase de orden es un acto insensato. Sólo hace falta mirar las posesiones y el entorno del demente para darse cuenta de esto. El capaz mantiene buen orden. Cuando la crueldad en nombre de la diciplina domina una raza, esa raza se le ha ense?ado a odiar y la raza está condenada. La verdadera lección es aprender a amar. Quien quiera mantenerse libre de todo ataque durante el trascurso de sus días, debe aprender esto. Nunca uses lo que se te ha hecho como base para odiar. Nunca desees la venganza. Requiere de verdadera fortaleza amar al hombre. Y amarlo a pesar de todas las tentaciones para hacer algo distinto, de todas las provocaciones y de todas las razones por las que deberíamos hacerlo. La felicidad y la fortaleza sólo perduran en ausencia del odio. Odiar por sí sólo es el camino hacia el desastre. Amar es el camino de la fortaleza. Amar a pesar de todo es el secreto de la grandeza, y es muy posible que sea el mayor secreto de este universo.|`|AA10492394	perdonar? si tu amiga lastimo tus sentimientos y no al reves, no te tienes porque sentir mal<br>  lo mejor es que valores que tanto vale la pena su persona, por lo que cuentas no tienes la culpa de nada, asi que animo que hay cosas peores en la vida  =P|`|2c0641058c3d6d99b011bb5336198737aa	Esme me mustaria me permitienras ser tu amigo navarretetony@yahoo.co|`|F5ffSx3Paa	no te preocupes, si en verdad son buenas amigas se van a saber perdonar, sólo se necesita tiempo y paciencia,<br>  <br>  en cuestión al trabajo, no hay más justicia que aquel que no haga lo correcto, a lo mejor casi nadie hace lo correcto hoy en dia y lo que hiciste para mi estuvo bien, no le van a dar un premio al más tramposo.<br>  <br>  recuerda que la confiansa  no es algo que se les da a las personas nada más porque si, se debe de trabajar, el perdón tambien, tu mente estará tranquila sólo si tú has logrado perdonar, si los demás no te perdonan ya no esta en tú poder, pero eso ya no te compete a ti.<br>  <br>  "el que no sabe perdonar, no será perdonado en esta vida ni en la otra".(creo que asi va un proverbio, jajaj)..........suerte.|`|omhwNd3Xaa	Yo se muy bien de q estas hablando, me he sentido asi muchisimas veces pero te voy a decir q hago cuando pienso en lo q me paso y me hizo desconfiar de la gente.

La amistad no es solo confiar en alguien, la amistad es aprender a perdonar, y la forma más fácil es dejar a ésa persona de lado un tiempo y observar, si crees que vale la pena recuperar la amistad, las cosas se arreglarán solas, si crees que no pues suerte y encuentra a personas con las que realmente te sientas bien, a gusto y con las que no te de miedo decir o hacer nada, porque los verdaderos amigos se aceptan, sean cuales sean las cualidades o los defectos de los demás.<br>  Y, sobre todo, si perdonas a esta persona, no te olvides de lo que pasó. Es difícil, pero lo mejor es perdonar, seguir sin rencores, pero no olvidarte de nada. Porque si esa persona es tu amig@ de verdad no tienes porqué volver a enfadarte, pero si por casualidades de la vida pasa, pues tendrás presente lo que pasó en el pasado.<br>  Espero que te haya servido, hasta pronto!!<br>  <br>  --mcampos--|`|t9TLPYvbaa	Yo pase por lo mismo que tu hace ya un buen  rato!! estaba igual que tu no crei en nadie ni en nada.

Al poco tiempo conoci a unas personas super buenisima onda!!! que me brindaron su amistad incondicional.<br>  La confianza dura tiempo para construirla pero solo un momento para destruirla.<br>  No te cierres a la amistad !!! habla con tu amiga y dile lo que sientes y lo que te hizo y si tu ves que la amistad ya no da para mas, pues mandala a volar !!!! recuerda que siempre va haber alguien que necesitas lo que tu tienes.<br>  Bye y Buena Vibra!!!!

Tambien puedes ir a un super, comprar dos o tres cositas y entre ellas una cajita de forros, vas por caja rapida, y en dos patadas ya tenes todo guardado en la bolsa, creo que es lo mas facil y rapido.<br>  Tranquilo que todo va a salir bien, y que no te de verguenza, todo el mundo tiene sexo (aunque la mayoria no use preservativos)|`|eed70c9eff0e9ff39e1dc5c34af0c7f6aa	llegas a la farmacia y le dices al encargado, o encargada: me da unos condones de tal marca y tal presentacion (investiga primero cual quieres....asi no te veras como un novato) y ya, no pasa nada en que los compres, malo sino los compras o sino los usas...|`|2SyOYyTaaa	Tu timidez va a causar que dejes pre?ada a alguna mujer mejor ponte apensar que si ya tienes relaciones es por que ya estas madurito de alguna forma entonces el hecho de no poder comprar condones es una tonteria.... agarrate los pantalones y di:  me da un preservativos por favor... de cuales?  pues trojannn|`|JJo9ycYaaa	La otra vez fui al ba?o de un cine y habia una maquina que daba preservativos... ahi solo costaban $1 y hay diferentes tipos para elegir.<br>  <br>  Si viste alguna vez los simpsons vez a Homero querer pedir un fuego artificial ilegal y para eso empieza a pedir cualquier cosa (Ej: revista xxx, papas fritas, comida, etc.) Puedes hacer lo mismo. pedis algo  (lo que sea) y pide los preservativos y cuando te diga el precio le decis: "no, mejor esto no... no me alcanza, me quedo con esto" (y supuestamente te quedas con el preservativo) <br>  jaja...<br>  Pero no tengas timidez... imaginate que le pedis un paquete de papas fritas. es como pedirle cualquier otra cosa. ademas hay mucha gente que compra preservativos. <br>  Suerte, ojala te los compres.<br>  Salu2 para todos!|`|QP8loQ3Baa	no te tendria que dar verguenza, al reves, si compras preservativos es por algo...|`|VEWMmFsmaa	compralo por internet solo necesitas tarjeta de credito y te lo envian a tu casa en un paquete muy discreto ...pero igualmente tendrias que tratar de superar tu timidez es algo muy normal comprarlo x lo menos en el super que no tenes que pedir nada sino servirtelo vos mismo ...o si vas a un hotel tambien lo podes comprar ya que lo tienes que pedir por telefono y te lo llevan a tu habitacion y no le ves la cara a nadie ..fijate y suerte!|`|a7UFj7vjaa	Mucho depende de tu edad, si este fuera el caso no le des mucha importancia porque si eres adolescente es mayor la importancia de adquirirlos.<br>  Un mal consejo: FINJE QUE NO TE IMPORTA HACERLO, solo hazlo y trata de finjir, al final te enga?as tu mismo pero de que funciona, no hay duda.<br>  <br>  Suerte, cuidate y no dejes de comprarlos.|`|k37tCMiEaa	farmacia es la mejor pero q no hay gente y los pides ok bye|`|otEmFjE9aa	No seas tontillo por vergüenza de no comprarlos después vayas a agarrar una fuerte infección venérea, y eso si que te va hacer sentir apenado.

baa557cef234a37bb809caadfb9425b3aa	Un célèbre dicton populaire prédit qu' ?un bon bailleur en fait bailler sept ?. Il est coutumier de parler de contagion.<br>  Le baillement est un comportement réflexe, tout le monde baille, l'homme comme les animaux, et pas seulement les mammifères. Les poissons, les reptiles, les oiseaux, enfin presque tous les vertébrés sont sujets au baillement. Il s'agit là d'un comportement physiologique très courant. Il ne faut pas s'en inquiéter tant qu'ils ne se répètent pas de manière trop rapprochée et trop fréquente.<br>  <br>  Le baillement sert à stimuler notre cerveau lorsqu'il a besoin d'être excité tandis qu'il souffre de sommeil ou d'ennui. Ce mystère comportemental a été résolu par un psychologue de l'université Temple de Philadelphie. En demandant à des cobayes humains de porter des capteurs de mouvement durant plusieurs jours et d'appuyer sur un bouton à chaque baillement, il a découvert qu'ils baillaient moins d'un quart d'heure avant une phase d'activité. Comme un concertiste avant d'entrer en scène ou un félin se préparant à partir en chasse. Bouche ouverte, machoires raidies et narines frémissantes, une grande quantité d'air est alors aspirée, ce qui augmenterait l'irrigation du cerveau et son activité. D'ailleurs, on baille aussi en cas de mal des transports ou d'hémorragie qui diminuent la circulation cérébrale. <br>  <br>  Mais pourquoi est-ce communicatif ? <br>  C'est un réflexe de sociabilité que nous avons hérité des primates et surtout des grands singes dont nous faisons partie. Le baillement constituerait un signal permettant de synchroniser les activités d'un groupe animal lorsqu'il doit passer à l'action. Le baillement permet d'apaiser les tensions, d'établir une cohésion à l'intérieur d'un groupe et d'enlever l'agressivité de quelque individus; C'est la base de l'empathie réfléchie : comprendre le ressentiment de l'autre, ressentir soi-même ce que l'autre ressent.<br>  <br>  Mais la bouche ouverte n'est pas le déclencheur puisque, même en mettant poliment sa main devant sa bouche, on peut faire décrocher la machoire à son entourage. L'étude éthologique des primates révèle qu'à certains moments, un groupe entier se met à bailler ensemble, sans qu'un individu ne puisse percevoir l'autre de quelque manière que ce soit, ni visuellement, ni auditivement, ni olfactivement. Le signal serait dans les yeux qui larmoient et le nez qui se retrousse.<br>  Lorsque l’on baille, on a tendance à pleurer un peu. Cela est d? à la contraction des sacs lacrymaux, à la base de l’?il, provoqué par la contraction de la machoire lors du baillement.<br>  <br>  La réplication du baillement s'apparente au décryptage d'une émotion, d'un état de vigilance d'autrui à un niveau automatique non conscient permettant une synchronisation d'état de vigilance entre individus, qu'on pourrait qualifier d'empathie instinctive involontaire.<br>  <br>  En espérant avoir répondu à ta question…<br>  <br>  Amicalement…|`|21d244ea08ae5a502603f807b9b4888caa	et un bon bailleur en fait bailler 7!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|45VOBzhQaa	j'avais vu la même question dans un magazine pour enfants, et malheureusement je l'ai jeté :(|`|FnHOBKPoaa	ha ha ha c'est vrai en + bizarre comme truc nan? :D<br>  <br>  vien de bailler a cause de toi mdr<br>  <br>  je trouve que le mot "BAILLER" fait BAILLER <br>  <br>  si si|`|YpD7S5rRaa	C'est une influence ,une suggestion psychique la personne qui baille  qui est à c?t' de vous vous influence elle a un petit pouvoir sur vous ;elle vous pousse à baillir|`|UYuhyl7Saa	?a s'appelle l'empathie... les chimpanzés y sont sujets aussi... je te laisse faire tes propres recherches^^|`|XWQgoFbcaa	rien qua lire ta question j'en baille ,c'est vrai c'est etrange|`|af7kH7U9aa	oh là tu nous la bailles belle !!!<br>  voila un lien passionnant qui explique tres bien ce phenomène <br>  <a href="http://www.baillement.com/recherche/echokinesie.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.baillement.com/recherche/echo...</a><br>  tu trouveras dans ce site tout ce que tu veux savoir sur le baillement

nLrbleCPaa	The first bit of advise I can give you is to stay away from acai berry. This is nothing more than a pyramid scam.    I would say you are burning calories for sure. I would cut your sauna time down to 10 minuets per visit. Anything more may cause weight loss that you don't want.    10 minuets should be enough time to release the impurities.|`|mTwn8p79aa	Your heart shouldn't race because of heat.  If you're actually seeing 140 - 150 bpm you should get to a doctor as it could be a sign of something worse.    You also don't need to be in there to "excrete impurities."  Sounds like someone's been paying attention a little too closely to those silly kinoki foot pad commercials.  Sweat isn't how your body gets rid of any impurities, that's the function of your liver and kidneys.  How would your body be "sending" these impurities around your system to get sweated out from your liver anyway?  Through your blood?  Then from the blood to sweat glands?  You're assuming your blood has some sort of intelligence or there's some sort of membrane that would allow "bad" things into the gland.  Of course, neither are correct.    You really aren't burning many more calories.  You aren't changing your core body temperature while you're in a sauna.    Saunas are a great place for healthy people to relax after a work out.  They have little, if anything, to do with weight gain or loss.  With your heart condition it may be a very unsafe place to be.  There's a reason it has a warning about increased heart rate on the sign outside the sauna and the hot tub.|`|3UQrUNMSaa	The basic purpose of a sauna is to rejuvenate the body and soul. People have been enjoying the therapeutic benefits of the sauna for many a centuries.    Dry sauna has several therapeutic benefits. The sauna kits have been basically associated with the Scandinavians and Finnish people while the origins of sauna bath have been attributed to the Romans (the rich and lavish of their century).    The dry sauna kits claim to rid the body of toxins, aid in the process of weight loss and also help to get rid of viruses. The sauna offers a complete body package making it healthy, fit and fine.    Both the dry sauna and the steam rooms can help soothe your senses and at the same time remove many of the toxic metals you may have acquired from the environment. However, dry sauna kits have an added advantage over the steam rooms that you can rid yourself from some of the more toxic metals like sulphuric acid, sodium, cholesterol, lead, nickel and cadmium.    By nature, the kidneys are equipped with the function of shedding up of toxins from the body. The use of dry sauna is an added advantage as sweating helps the body in releasing the harmful toxins.    Dry sauna kits undoubtedly provide assistance in weight loss as they help in the burning up of calories. The sauna kit gives a lot of attention to the body which makes the heart beat stronger to send blood to the capillaries and thus it affects the process of burning up of calories.    Technically it was observed that dry sauna works through emphasizing on the sweat glands. The sweat glands must work to produce the sweat. This act of sweat production requires the burning of a lot of calories. Fats and carbohydrates are converted into calories required to cool the body down once it acquires heat energy from the sauna.    However, it has been scientifically proved that an average person can burn up to 300 calories during a single dry sauna session. Three hundred calories are equivalent to an average weight training of one hour or jogging for 2 to 4 miles.    It is very essential to keep in mind that dry sauna heats up the body which on an average takes a quarter of the water from the body. It is required that whosoever undergoes sauna therapy must drink fresh juice after taking the sauna bath. Dry sauna benefits are enormous if in case proper care is taken before and after taking a sauna bath.|`|DzyCjYToaa	try to have not exercised before you go in the sauna. also at what temperature is it? that plays a large affect. also do you just sit there, or do you follow the original idea, by going out to swim ect to cool off every now and then?    its a lot easier to answer this question once i know.|`|YbnqMe11aa	rofl @ these dirt bags linking their affiliate sites    As for Saunas - they're great for the ideas you mentioned above - cleansing the system, promoting circulation and blood flow, and relaxation.    As for interfering with your weight gain - don't worry.  It is not as if you're doing cardio in the sauna for 15-30min.  Granted, your heart rate gets higher to improve circulation (to help cool off your body and regulate internal temperature), but you aren't burning calories in the same sense as if you hopped on a treadmill.|`|753ISfGMaa	You should only stay for at least 30 minutes in a sauna room at least  once or twice a week..
08965f2b98bcd6a91a1ca8d6f7fc5944aa	Did you actually tell them that you had an abnormally disrupted sleep that night? It's important that they know that. Apart from the fact that they need to know that to interpret the data properly, they probably should be told that the conditions were less than ideal so that they can do something about it for future patients!!     They may or may not be able to gather useful data from your night of disrupted sleep, it depends what kind of sleep disorder you have. But unless they know that your night's sleep wasn't typical, they might not be able to draw the right conclusions.
LcLGnTVMaa	I have used Cymbalta and Seroquel, but they were never prescribed together for me. As Gabe stated, Seroquel is designed as a sedative. It will have different effects for different people though. For me personally, it was used to bring me "down" to a more "normal" state because I was very anxious. I did not suffer any ill effects from it, but thats not to say you wont. Seriously, leave the dosage to the Dr. The Dr. bases his dosage on many factors regarding you. He will start small and work his way up. They will keep increasing the dose until your symptoms go away OR you complain of adverse side effects from the higher dose. Side effects such as a drug induced haze, or possibly far worse. Never alter the prescribed dosage with any drug like these. Normally when a Dr. refers to the maxium dosage, they refer to the max amount of a med that you can take before physical harm to the body becomes a risk. Dont confuse that with adverse and possibly severe side effects that can happen before that dosage is even reached. Dido, for the Cymbalta. I could go on and on trying to make my point, but I hope you are getting it from the answers you are recieving. DONT MESS WITH THIS!|`|LGidAYDwaa	Everyone is different and has different reactions to medications. What might be OK for me may not be OK for you. (My mom goes into a drug-induced haze after taking one ibuprofen, so she's ultra-sensitive. I am also more likely to go into a drug-induced haze than the average person.)     I'm on Seroquel 300mg. It makes me incredibly sleepy, but that is the reason I take it: I do not go into deep sleep. I take the regular Seroquel, not the time-released 24-hour pill.  I tried Cymbalta, but the very first dose made me high as a kite - it did do what it was supposed to, though, which is reduce my depression and relieve pain. But it worked so well, it rid me of any sensation whatsoever. (But I was so high, I didn't care!) I've never tried perphenazine.    The FDA usually sets a maximum effective dose of medications (MMRD). Many insurance companies follow their suggested MMRD religiously. You can find those maximum effective doses by looking up each medication online - I've done that for you below:    http://bipolar-disorder.emedtv.com/seroq...  MRDD for Seroquel    http://depression.emedtv.com/cymbalta/cy...  Cymbalta    http://mental-health.emedtv.com/perphena...  Perphenazine    Most doctors will only prescribe one drug at a time if you are sensitive to medications. They do this so that if you have any side effects, they will know which medication it is that caused them. Another reason they do this is so that they won't overprescribe your medications - if the Seroquel is doing a great job stabilizing your moods, then you wouldn't need another medication added to it to give you adequate relief.  If the medications are unrelated - not in the same drug family, like Tylenol and ibuprofen are in different families - then the MMRD for each drug should not cause undue harm, unless of course, you are sensitive to one of the meds.     Your doctor likely has a lot of experience prescribing the drugs you mention here and has likely seen the combination work well for many different patients. Your regular visits with your psychiatrist will follow your progress. At that time, your psychiatrist will be able to make adjustments to the medications in order to give you maximum relief at minimal doses.  If you find that you do end up in that drug-induced haze, some doctors will change the timing of the doses - like Seroquel and Perphenazine at night and Cymbalta in the morning.  So there are many options for your drug regimen, and hopefully you and your doctor will find what works best for you quickly.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Well idk why you would want to take them like that. I was on a very high dose though of both cymbalta and seroquel.    For cymbalta i was on the max effective dose, 60mg. While taking this i was also on Seroquel, 400mg tablets.     Again i must ask you need to re think seroquel, for it is a SEVERELY STRONG sedative. You could be standing up and pass out knocking your head, you could drown, you cant even control your bladder while on it, meaning you will have vvery many times you wake up covered in Urine, or worse.    The combination of those left me very incapable of daily needed activities such as walking, brushing my teeth, and sometimes eating.|`|hWc65sEtaa	Only a dr or pharmacist can tell you how much of a number of drugs you can take at one time or even whether you can take them together at all.  Please ask someone who is licensed to do this before attempting to take them.|`|ojEkgJoqaa	first of all you should consult your doctor.    yu can also go to the drug interaction checker on pdr drug checker    but i know that taking seroquel and prphenazine aren't good to take together because of qt prolongation or it can effect your heart by causing tachachardia and others    best bet first check doctor. look on drug interaction checker and also on each drug what the drug interactions can be

I OD'd on ibuprofen and benedryl. Got into a fight with my mother and she was screaming in my face. I told her to get away from me, and when she wouldn't i grabbed her neck with my one hand and squeezed as hard as i could. She had bruises there for about 3 weeks. Never in a million years did i think i'd ever hurt my mom, no matter how much she had ever hurt me in the past, but that day... I just snapped!  I honestly wonder to this day if i wouldn't have passed out if i wouldn't have killed her or hurt her even worse!|`|Tt83sT5Iaa	omg that sounds so scary :(  ive never actually been in one, i almost got admitted once, i cut my wrist when i had an eating disorder and they took me to hospital but they never actually kept me in ....    hope youre better now xx|`|f19e89jKaa	the part where they refer to it as a hospital rather than a jail scares me the most|`|88a3bbbf6dab801eaa5ad76bd8ed789daa	Psychiatric medicine are very troublesome in the beginning.|`|kl1kzlzXaa	Realizing that you can't get out, until you no longer wish to get out... the desire to leave is considered pathological, so you must extinguish desire.

yCwPxulYaa	I had this too after I had my baby.  I felt like I always had the flu.  I had no energy, always tired.  I would get very dizzy in the shower, while doing dishes etc.  I went to the doctor and I was anemic.  He started me on Iron pills and I started taking prenatels again and I feel like a new person.      It is just a simple blood test that your physician can do.  Sounds to me like Anemia though.|`|dV9MRBfwaa	Seriously, it sounds like your depressed?|`|qx4F2SJmaa	I felt just like that after my daughter was born.      She is now 15 months.    Have your Dr. run a thyroid screen.  It's a little costly, but worth it.  Also, have an iron test, and take vitamins daily.  Get more potassium.    Just the overwhelm of being a mommy can contribute to that.  Plus, if you are an older mom it can be harder to get back to your normal self.|`|tcU1Xnftaa	You need to continue taking your prenatal vitamins.|`|1ORCUzIJaa	well you had a kid so that could be one problum. try to force your self to eat. but not to much. try to eat healthy food, not to faty or high in coletoral. my sugjestion is you see a doctor.|`|9DCbGo0laa	Ask your doctor.|`|qRwjtaNbaa	You could just be drained from having the baby. It takes alot out of you. But never rule out Lyme's disease. My daughter had it and went undiagnosed for three  months till the Dr's. got it right and by then she was really sick. If your symptoms persist, go to the dr. Even if you're anemic, you can be treated. Feeling crappy all the time sucks.|`|mSZdCYWKaa	I would think it may be anaemia.

dSmoB64Yaa	Honestly, I don't think any woman can answer this question for you. I depends on your body. Some women have thicker hymens than other women. The hymen is the membrane that breaks when you have sex for the first time. For some women, their hymen is so thin, that breaks just form riding a bike or  riding a horse or some athletic activity. Some women have thicker hymens and it hurts more when it breaks and they usually bleed more. From my experience, in my younger years,it was usually a light issue of blood. Nothing compared to a woman who is having a heavy flow, on her period. As far a pain, I'm a guy, so I can't say. I'm sure it depends on a lot of things, like the thickness of your hymen, how wet or lubed you are, wether or not the guy is being gentle and taking his time. In some cases, it must not be that painfull, because, I had girls who came back for seconds, the next day, before noon. Ha ha! Don't worry, tell the guy it's your first time and to take it easy. Put the pressure on him to do a good job. Tell him you are counting on him to make it really nice, gentle and easy. Tell him you will always remember your first time , so he'd better make it good.  Don't let the guy get away with some quick, hard, half effort, sex. When I was young and girls told me I was going to be the first, I always felt a lot of pressure to do a good job . More importantly, make sure you are 100% ready to have sex and make the guy wear a condom and make sure he knows how to use it properly.|`|fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	The term 'pop your cherry' is an offensive term used by immature boys who believe 'taking' a girls virginity means breaking her hymen and vice-versa referring to it as if some sort of prize, why on earth would you degrade yourself and other women by using a term like that?     Everyone is different, some girls dont have a hymen at all, there are all sorts of different hymens, and some will break where as some will stretch, some will be damaged from sports where as others dont break until a woman gives birth. A hymen breaking can bleed, it could be just a few drops enough to turn discharge a little pink, or it could be full bleeding like that of a light period that lasts a few days. A hymen breaking can be painful, but it is just as likely that you wont feel it at all or that it will feel pleasurable. There is nothing gross about the hymen breaking or your body. Your hymen doesn't always break during sex it can break before you ever have sex or during sex it may just stretch. Regardless of whatever does happen during sex know that sex should never be painful, even when the hymen is in tact know that you can stop and address the situation before carrying on with sex or trying again another time, don't just tolerate pain during sex.|`|PeMpDAbraa	I didn't bleed. I was active around that time and it had broken on its own. Don't worry. And yes..sex does hurt if your body isn't mature enough to handle it and even then..it may hurt the first few times.|`|Q7uzVqGtaa	When i had sex the first time it was pretty painful but nothing you can't handle and i started bleeding as soon as we were done having sex.  I bled quite a bit heavy at first and  it lasted for about a week or so and i bled the first 3 times i had sex after that as well.  It's just something girls have to go through but also it could be different for every girl|`|G5lI278Aaa	if you are using the term "pop ur cherry" then i dont think you are ready to have sex.  it doesnt always bleed.  i didnt, but thats cause my boyfriend and i did other things first.
ChSrd2ftaa	You are just 15 yrs old and this is great that you have treated your acne at this age. This is your growing age and all the spots will fade away very soon. The skin gets renewed fast at this young age. The small pits will also go away ut of course, they will take more time to heal. You can ask your doc to prescribe a scar removal cream for you. Mederma can be used to treat this. You could have gone for chemical peels but as you are 15, you have to wait for that.|`|MHg9JhEKaa	You have to give it some more time - the little pin holes may or may not get better, but you need to finish your roaccutane course first.     If they don't go, then laser surgery can help, although you would have to prove that these marks significantly affect you psychologically to have this treatment on the NHS. Otherwise you may have to pay a couple of grand to have them removed.     Other than that you can try to live with them - after all they're small, and obviously much better than having a face full of acne. Try not to go down the route of growing facial hair to cover them, it will make you more self conscious in the long run - you gonna have a beard for the rest of your life?|`|0e33e812d76b8f8fe9810d0893f6e0b7aa	Go to your GP and ask for some Retinol A.

Kd6Hx2rHaa	You don't sound fat. If you feel insecure about it, do something. Exercise and eat healthy and you'll flatten your stomach without becomming anorexic looking. You shouldn't let people at school bother you. My advice for toning yourself would be to walk. People don't think it works but it really does. Walking will tone out your thighs, butt, and abdominal muscles. Plus, it's good for your heart. The people at school calling you fat are bitches so tell them to **** off. :)|`|F0LgeWs5aa	You are not fat... my son is 10 and @ 147lbs. 5' 5" down from 156.  he has been at the top of the BMI scale all his life.

A Cardio workout plan is the best thing for you. Not weights but high volumes of sweating from running and playing. I read in a fitness magazine drink cold water on an empty stomach to increase your metabolism. this burns fat from those reserve areas " stomach and hips" have Mom or Dad look at the site I mentioned.  Good Luck and God Bless.|`|WQUeP4FZaa	nooo im fat im wat 123 pounds and thats becuz my mom overfeed me.|`|Qh2rc1DNaa	I'm not sure how tall you are.  That would help a little.

If you are really worried about your weight...try to do some exercise...walk more, run, bike, swim etc.|`|AGaT3BDMaa	NOO! Personale I don't think people should go by their wieght on the scale.

A lot of my friends are jealous of my curves, it's just a fact of life you can never be 100% happy with yourself but you can 99.9999999%  Look at me rambling on, but anyway, confidence comes with age.  Just enjoy being a kid and growing up.|`|mTwn8p79aa	Weight without height doesn't tell us anything.  If you're at least 5'2" I don't think you've got anything to worry about.

You're not even a teeny-bopper yet. Chances are, kids at your school are skinny at that age because they don't eat everything they're supposed to.

757689131b0b1f85d533f06a9c3197d2aa	I'm sorry to hear that, sweetie.  It's normal to have some anxiety over the fact that our loved ones will die some day, but it doesn't help to worry about it all the time.  I am no mental health expert, but since you are taking 3 meds already I wouldn't recommend another one just for this particular problem.  Zoloft and Ativan are supposed to help with anxiety.  Although I believe that some people truly do have chemical imbalances in their brains, I think psychiatrists overmedicate people- they dole out prescription drugs like they're candy.  It really pisses me off.  Whatever happened to trying to work out our problems by using mental exercises?  Drugs are not always the answer.  My father is on meds and they aren't doing jack for him.  When I was your age I was on Prozac, Paxil, Wellbutrin, and none of them worked.  It took attitude and environmental changes in my life to heal my mind.  After all, most teenagers and young adults get depressed once in awhile; it is completely normal.  Anyway, as I was saying: Try to exercise mind over matter.  Like, whenever an unpleasant thought about your mother dying enters your head immediately think about something positive and totally unrelated to death or your mother.  Or pick up a book, turn on the TV, or start a conversation with someone...  anything to take your mind off of that.  You are definitely not the only one who has unpleasant thoughts.  I speak from personal experience and those things I mentioned above are ways I take my mind off of negative thoughts.  Also, I don't know if you're into horror movies or not, but I wouldn't recommend watching them at all.      I hope I have helped at least a little.  Sorry this is a bit lengthy.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Its some bad anxiety. You shouldnt worry so much though. i know its harder than it sounds but you really shouldnt. Exercise will help a lot when you start getting worked up about the probablity of her dying some how.    Whats the dose on the ativan and how many per day do you take?|`|hmsMpECkaa	What are you doing besides thinking about your mom?  You are not her mom, she is your mom.   According to the bible, your mother has 80 more years to live.  What are you going to do in those 80 years?  That's a long time.     I didn't see the edits but that is projected suicide thoughts.    Tell your mom or somebody who knows that you are taking those pills because it is a sign of overdose.  And as soon as you can, get off those pills!|`|dCF1UBUsaa	I remember seeing a show on TV where a girl was worried about her mom dying in accidents like this. I don't know what the actual problem was, but a therapist would be a good start.|`|Tt83sT5Iaa	i went through a phase of this when i was depressed. it soon passed tho.. if yours doesnt, maybe you should tell your mum and talk to her about seeing a therapist??  hope ur ok xx|`|2eHFbEstaa	get over it everyone dies ok .talk to her about it find out wat she thinks ...|`|uWLYsYwoaa	1st tell her how much you love her,  I am sure it will mean alot to her. It suck we cant do much about things we cant control.  Enjoy every minute that u have w/ her.  At 40 these should not be too much to worry about.  She should be with you for like abnother 40 plus years.  good luck|`|SG1iNJqFaa	I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN I USED TO GO THROUGH THE SAME THINGS AND MY MOTHER IS ONLY 35  BUT I LEARNED THAT WHEN YOUR PARENTS ARE STILL YOUNG YOU REALLY SHOULDNT THIINK SO MUCH ABOUT THT KIND OF STUFF BUT IT REALLY HELPED ME WHEN I SPOKE TO MY MOM ABOUT IT. AND IF YOUR REALLY WORRIED ABOUT STUFF LIKE THAT THEN JUST SPEND AS MUCH TIME WITH HER AS YOU CAN. AND ENJOY  YOUR TIME  TOGETHER

LV8uUmehaa	Yo, first off this is completely normal, I'm 13 years old and I'm at the other end. I hit puberty at around 10 years old. Everyone develops at different times, it makes you no less of a person. Some kids in my class have not hit puberty yet, and they're smaller than you with no body-hair atall! In some years you will notice some changes, but I'm afraid there is nothing you can do about it. You can talk to your closest friend(s) about it to get some other view points. Try not to worry mate, you will catch up, of all a sudden you'll get a growth spurt. I'm not that tall myself, maybe 5"4' and I hit puberty a long time ago. Trust me, It'll turn out fine.|`|AA11234591	If you have any signs of hair in areas where you didn't have hair before when you were about...let's say 9 or 10 years old, I'd say you are well on your way in the early stages of puberty.  A kid at that age don't usually have armpit hair.  By the time I started noticing some hair fuzziness in my private parts, my first monthly came within months, just after my 13th birthday; before that, I had noticed the looseness of my breasts (no longer being flat) just before or around the time I started 6th grade, about 11 years or so.  Also, you will pretty much start having a growth spurt soon, if not now.  Everyone starts out differently and at different times, per se, so you shouldn't worry about it!|`|p5YkuM92aa	In a couple of years everything will be A OK!!|`|Gn3kqG8paa	Dude, you're only 13....some people don't hit puberty to 15. I'm not bragging but I hit puberty at age 11....as in my first hair and all that. Some develop early, some develop later, stop being impatient, this is something that has to begin happening on it's own.|`|hZx6s5y1aa	your just 13 years old !! you are still young !! and don't believe everyone telling ya that they have  "hit puberty "  maybe they are lying !! and you will get taller since you are still 13 ... men stop growing at the age of  21.|`|qa5bMEkWaa	guys can start puberty anywhere from 10 to 15 girls from 8 to 13|`|de61674560750ca671798a74d4f68053aa	Don't worry about it. People have different growth spurt. Yours may be a little bit late, but it doesn't mean that you won't hit puberty at all. Just give it time, and wait for it.    I once was very short, too. And my friends kept laughing at me. However, once I hit my growth spurt, I was taller than some of them, and then they couldn't laugh any longer. So don't worry about it. And in the mean time, just keep eating things that are good for your health. Go swimming and drink milk help, too.    Hope I helped here.|`|u8CFwtyMaa	The changes due to puberty never happen to order, you just have to take them as they come. I started at 12, and my son didn't start until he was almost 14 (he's taller than me now).  Don't try to compare yourself to your friends, everyone is different.  The fact that you have some bodily hair suggests that the rest will be starting soon.  Hope this helps|`|oojO4WAraa	People are all different.  Be patient.  It will happen.|`|DtEjIcIbaa	People go through it at different times, hold out, :D
ufgv7oTjaa	I imagine that you could ask yourself that question... did it work? Are you able to see colors better?    The research that I've done on the Bates Method has shown that it does help temporarily work the eyes, but it's very seldom permanent... I haven't really heard of anything that can correct color blindness, but theoretically some surgeries might help (maybe a current one, maybe one to be made in the future). Good luck!|`|yE2vM76naa	Color blindness is for the most part due to a genetic trait which causes the eyes to be lacking in specific anatomy needed to see color.     Not a thing you can do to put them there after you are born.
BFLLJc7eaa	yea. your body will get weakened from the flu. basically your going to go back a couple days and take a easy on the exercise.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	no i think you are just a little obsessed with exercise if you are worried about missing when you are sick|`|TQcUTfaRaa	Probably. But I would be more worried about the flu-  lol. Take loads and loads of Vitamin C. Take at least 10,000 mg per day.|`|8RiufGhVaa	It's ok. I just got over the flu, I didn't exercise for a week but I'm still in the same shape i was before I got sick. Be careful when you start working out again and take it easy. If you do too much too fast you could injure yourself or start to feel sick again.
4f46a3ab367e69b76b30e6290112ed68aa	Sweat helps, but your heart rate is a better determining factor. It should be raised, probably in the neighborhood of 110 beats per minute (depending on your age and shape).|`|yorfmfiBaa	I wonder this too sometimes, so i just work out until I physically cannot take it anymore. Than i push myself a little farther, and stop. When Im completely worn out, I know I must've done something right. :)|`|mTwn8p79aa	This is easy, heart rate.  Sweat is a great indicator that you've got your heart rate up, but really, it's as easy as holding your finger up to your throat and counting.  The calculation for target heart rate is double your resting heart rate less your age per minute.|`|KPtrfsEYaa	Well if you are not sweating then you are not working hard enough.  You need to keep heart elevated for at least 30 minutes, an hour is best.  If you don't have a heart rate monitor then you can judge by your breathing.  It is very important to control your breathing, but you should not be a able to carry a conversation.  Also if you are one of those people who are reading a book or magazine while doing your cardio you are not working hard enough.|`|FOsd9DP6aa	If your heart rate increases, you sweat slightly and you get slightly out of breath, then you know you're exercising and it's working :)|`|AN9PdKmgaa	check your heart rate it should go up while exercising
HqS6TiiQaa	Poop is a fairly disgusting topic to discuss. It seems that we have no problems talking about the color and consistency of baby poop, but when it comes to our own poop, the topic is forbidden. Poop is  a byproduct of anything and everything we put into our body. It is also a barometer for our health. A lot about a person's health can be said about the type of poop he/she exhumes. The color of your poop can say a lot about you and your health condition. There are various types of poop colors that can be harmless, or alarming.    Brown  Brown is the typical color that appears in the toilet when someone poops. The color is naturally produced by a variety of factors. First of all, there is a pigment called bilirubin that is formed when the red blood cells in the liver and bone marrow break down. When the bilirubin ends up in the intestines, bacteria begins to form and eat. This is turns the poop brown. Another reason for the brown poop color is the iron found in the red blood cells. Brown poop is completely normal and should be no cause for concern.    Tarry Black  Tarry black poop is reason for concern. Although an excess of iron in a diet can cause poop to appear black, the tarry quality is caused by something else entirely. Tarry black poop can mean there is a bleeding ulcer or bleeding in the intestines. If you see this type of poop in the toilet, contact a physician as soon as possible.    Yellow  Yellow poop can have two causes. One is harmless while the other is serious. The harmless cause of yellow poop is something called Gilber's Syndrome. As stated earlier, brown poop gets it's color from the breakdown of red blood cells. Someone with Gilbert's Syndrome doesn't break down as many red blood cells when they process food. This is a harmless condition that is normally found in teenage males. The more serious cause for yellow poop is a Giardia infection. This is called by tiny parasites in the intestines that cause yellow diarrhea. This disease is extremely contagious and dangerous.    Perfectly healthy adults can experience green poop. Diets that are full of leafy green vegetables experience a green tint to their poop. Also, food coloring as in frosting or ice cream can turn your poop green. Some people experience a green color to their poop when they add an iron supplement to their diet. This is nothing to worry about unless you become constipated. Iron tends to constipate people as well.    Poop, like people, can come in many different shapes, sizes, and colors. Sometimes the color of your poop can be alarming, however, if you know what signs to look for, color changes become less stressful. If your poop is brown, black, yellow, or green, be sure to research and consult with a physician to be sure your condition is healthy and normal.|`|utGddhnVaa	Just what you've eaten usually.

As for the other drugs and alcohol, try laying off that crap. (Yes I realize I sound hypocritical) But seriously, this is the fastest way to help your situation. Trust.

I have taken aloe vera juice to help with an intestinal problem and that worked for me.  Other than that, most natural herbs take time - it's not a quick fix.  I think the best thing to do is go to the doctor - bottom line.|`|cb88569354fa813399bd99b338324ae4aa	Homeopathy is not a quick relieving method. Unlike modern medicine, homeopathy believes in "slow but surely". I havent been to a homeopath in the US bc my state doesnt allow their practice. However, the naturopaths (they practice homeopathy, chinese medicine and can prescribe "modern" medicine) really havent done much for me. I belive this is bc they try to sell you supplements. They dont really do much testing (unlike the ones in mexico), though they at least try to educate you on what might be the cause of the problem, which is greatly appreciated. Yet the ones my family and i have been to in Mexico, do work. My  mother had a back problem and we had gone to 'doctors' and even though they gave her medicine it didnt help. Homeopathic medicine did and she's never had a problem again. Same with my grandpa, he had colon problems and our homeopath took care of it. Im not here to try to make anyone believe anything. Im just telling you my experience|`|AA11748197	I think you misunderstand what homeopathy really is. The medicines in homeopathy are pure extracts from the plants, minerals, and natural elements in such a way that the extracts are potentized to give maximum benefit without inducing side effects as in the case of any western medicines.  If you do take an overdose of any medicine, the consequenses can be seen, even if it is homeopathy.  Homeopathy eradicates the illness. Western medicines suppress the symptoms. I think you should understand this principle.

Do yourself a favor and buy some neosporin ointment with some lidocaine topical pain reliever in it and keep the sensitive area treated with it.  Yes, I know much of the area is inside your urethra but treat as much of the area as you can.  If you get inflammation or obvious infection see your Dr. ASAP    I used to be a nurse a long time ago and catheterized hundreds of male patients...I know what I am talking about.|`|AA10096628	Give it at least 2 days, they are forcefully inserting something where it shouldn't be... think of it like when you get surgery, they stick a tube down your throat to your lungs to help u breathe, they take it off and when you wake up you have extreme throat pain, it hurts to swallow for 1-2 days... so give it time... but if it hurts extremely or there's blood, i'd go back to the doctor, even for pain killers.|`|p5YkuM92aa	I dunno but i do want to read any answers because with an enlarged prostate I am expecting to one of these days make a trip to the ER for this same procedure.|`|LV8uUmehaa	Sorry this isn't serious but I have to post.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|1lEuIu23aa	I have started the Special K diet and have lost 5 lbs in two weeks.  I also do the Wii Fit or walk my treadmill.|`|itLKsVpmaa	P90X.  It's not easy but has a lot of different workouts to it.|`|Ow2ZM7EYaa	I have been on Herbalife since October 2008.  I was a little skeptical at first because I love to eat.  The thought of having a shake for breakfast and lunch did not thrill me.  But I tried it and it worked pretty good.  I only wanted to loose about 10 pounds and tone up.  A friend got on it with me and he has lost about 20 pounds.      What I learned is the shake gives me all the vitamins and minerals I need daily.  Without trying to count this and starve myself.  I have also been taking their vitamins.  I was talking with my son today and I told him this year I have not had a cold or even a sniffle.      As for tone and strengthen, try more sets on your work out and not as much weight.  Riding a bike or taking a cycle class is also a great all around workout.
tkZBwnHaaa	The guy with the expensive e-book hopes you will pay for information that is freely available over the internet. He is also a quack -- you cannot "cure" acid reflux with grocery items, but you may be able to decrease its effects. The grocery items he is suggesting includes apples (he suggests delicious but any kind will do). He is also big on apple cider vinegar (caution: this only works for a few people and can be quite painful for others). Almonds and papayas are also really good and Aloe also works but I would be pretty desperate to try it...  The source listed below has a number of other items and things you can do that help.|`|yuOuoCfDaa	you need one item and one item only....the aloe vera plant.  Go purchase a stem of it from the store and drink it down with water.

It is well treated by a number of prescription drugs.    The best over the counter relief of hearburn, caused by acid indigestion, in my opinion, is Sodium Bicarbonate...baking soda.  Dissolve a teaspoon in a glass water and drink it.  Get ready to burp to release the resulting gas. Don't take too much.
IM3QwSS2aa	My understainding of those drugs is:  they increase the blood flow to the penile area therefore ginving an erection.  They do NOT increase Libidio, effect sperm count, effect semenial fluid.      unsolicited information: take some STIFF NIGHTS to maintain those youthful erections.  No joke. Those are some serious pills.  I would NOT be Surprised if they get taken off the market like Rize 2 the occasion did because it was too close to those prescribed drugs.  So better stock up before they change their formula, too.|`|8VvDU211aa	No, it does not make you unable to ejaculate. The whole point of Levitra and Viagra is to help you achieve and keep an erection long enough to COMPLETE sexual intercourse - which means ejaculation...    It shouldn't take you an extreme amount of time to get off either... it varies from person to person... Your doctor prescribed it to you for a reason so you are obviously healthy enough to take Levitra and have sexual intercourse...so what's the harm in trying it out?|`|p5YkuM92aa	Levitra and Viagra both work fine.  I had trouble keeping it up for more that a few minutes, barely enough to ejaculate.  Now using one of them I can stay hard, usually long enough for my partner to get off.  If she doesn't make it though she rubs my now partly flaccid member against her most sensitive protuberance and that does it.|`|BB7EX7keaa	why not try Viswizz, it's much safer and no side effects. you can take it even you drink and will always have a great time.
AA10723498	There is always a chance of recurrence.  My sister had a brain tumor, had surgery to remove it and now has another one.  I had breast cancer, had a mastectomy in 2007, and last November 7 2008, had a second mastectomy.  The oncologist told me if all the surrounding tissue has not been removed, there is always a chance of getting it again because it only takes one tiny cell to start it all over again.  You may have had a small tumor when the first one was removed and it wasn't noticed.  Go back tot he doctor to see if you have another tumor.  Don't wait, please|`|d456069f8e03a8bf7a79de76c7e45228aa	You need to have this check immediately . . the only warning anyone has that a reoccurence has taken place is if another growth appears .. take no chances . .  Waste no time and call your doctor today. The growth needs to be clinically examined. These types of tumors (Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma) when low grade have good prognosis, but they can reoccur frequently in the same location and require further treatment.    Good luck.

ikbHM3tUaa	To find the most appropriate laxative, it really depends what the constipation is from.    Do you take narcotics? Is this a bowel prep for a procedure? what's your age? any GI diagnoses? There are so many laxatives that im sure several would be perfectly acceptable for you. First try taking bulk-forming agents (metamucil, fiber supplements) Then you could try:    Senna +/- docusate (oral and liquid) - good for narcotic constipation  Miralax (powder for liquid) - fast acting, very effective maybe overkill though  Bisacodyl (oral) - probably a good first choice for you. (dulcolax)  Magnesium Citrate (liquid) - very fast and effective, maybe overkill  Fleet Phosphosoda    Most pharmacists don't recommend mineral oil, although it works it has some complications you'd prefer to avoid.|`|EN32vSsCaa	The fastest working laxatives are the osmotic laxatives, an example is magnesium citrate.

I can sometimes get by with just drinking some hot chocolate in the AM which will provide heat energy for getting started.  I also have to keep physically active.  Sitting around for me causes the profound 'cold' to return as the blood pressure drops.    When blood pressure drops, blood flow will focus on the major organs to sustain their functionality and this is done by diverting blood from the extremities.

tzOGamZTaa	Well, I have this, but I have an artificial valve, which clicks as it opens and closes. If you have an artificial valve this is normal otherwise you might want to get checked out.|`|5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	I have no medical background... Most doctors do..... Go see one of them.... but im sure you are ok.... but i would get checked out|`|rVRbTkmaaa	go to the doctor ?
gTWgbpNFaa	go to:  http://www.healthspan.co.uk/    they have all manner of remedies & delivery times are quick|`|0TtLt667aa	this might sound out of the ordinary but try cherry juice or anything cherries. good for joints.|`|hVKqKjrjaa	Bromelain has powerful anti-inflammatory actions and is widely used to reduce pain, swelling and inflammation associated with arthritis, sprains, wounds and soft tissue injuries. It is thought to promote tissue repair and has been shown to help reduce the bruising and pain that can follow minor operations or injury.|`|657ZoE3Daa	Try Cod Liver Oil tablets.I would have suggested Glucosamine as well but they obviously don't work for you.I think you should take the anti-inflammatory tablets if you really want the pain to stop.|`|b490c76dca3f43fb1bc6059f95de1004aa	you need to get the glucosamine with chondrotin and msm..and get some omega 3 capsules....  to feel the  benefit you have to take them for at least 6 weeks  they do work..I have had bad arthiritis for years....and dont like taking any of the prescribed tablets....and find I have had relief with the above..good luck|`|Ow2ZM7EYaa	I have been on a nutritional product called Nutrazon.  It have seen testimony on there websit and heard individuals say they have had great success with join pain on this product.  You only take 2 to 8 oz for the the first month then they recommend cutting back to 2 to 4 oz for maintenance.  Go to www.nutrazon.com/wnewman and check it out.  To look at its ingredients and befits are free.  Then draw your own conclusion.|`|m9BtngyZaa	I've been having the same but put it down to getting older, don't think it is though. Started taking cod liver oil tablets & seems to be helping. try them, see what happens eh.
wXKs94nDaa	You are used to the workout. It doesnot mean that the workout is not effective anymore, it just means that your muscles are stronger. If you are like me and like the burn, then try to increase the intensity. Jumping jacks are easy to incorporate in any workout and they boost up intensity really easily.|`|yp8NtB0faa	Your body is getting used to the workout.  Just because your don't feel the burn anymore doesn't mean it's still not building your muscles.  But if you like that feelings, trying lifting heavier weights and do more reps.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	you don't feel the burn anymore because your body is used to it you need to increase the intensity weight or whatever you do to the next level|`|4f46a3ab367e69b76b30e6290112ed68aa	Congratulations, you're getting stronger. If things get too easy, bump up the weight and change things around a bit. You won't always feel a burn the next day, though. It doesn't mean your body is not challenged and changing though unless you never change your routine or go up in weight.|`|MOeToR1Xaa	I think it is because your body is getting used to working out.|`|2WwfS4x4aa	your body is now used the fact of you working out so you shouldnt really feel the burn the next day..
7149XmBqaa	Ear wax build up is an insidious and heart breaking thing to experience. This happened to a friend of mine and he didn't know what was going on and was a bit alarmed.  After going to the doctor and having a large wax deposit removed, he felt like a fool.  Needless to say, he kept his ears clean after that. It happens.|`|G5lI278Aaa	it might just be clogged with ear wax.  that happened to me.  go to the doctor and they will check it out and clean it out for ya|`|ku0wHQDiaa	Try this!  Really- it works most often.    Have someone pour peroxide in your ear while you are tilting your head (must hold it tilted to keep the peroxide in your ear).  Leave it there for a good minute or two.  You will hear it bubbling- then tilt your head to dump it out.  Repeat this twice in about a 6 hour time and I bet you'll get it open and feel better.    Good Luck!
Mxq1NQJdaa	Need to call the optomotrist who prescribed them and ask them to tell you which is which.
f8mLpPXlaa	You sound like you've got the flu. Your vomiting is because you put acid(tomatoes) into an already sick stomach. Go easy on your stomach, like just eat the toast without the tomatoes.You're going to have to see a doctor for the chest problem. You'll need antibiotics to cover you.  God bless and I hope you feel better soon.|`|oojO4WAraa	You might have pneumonia.  The vomiting is caused by all the phlegm you are swallowing.  Call the doctor.|`|rSzvXjiqaa	time to see a doctor, kid.|`|RfwOQUPGaa	Go to doctor!  You'll probably be fine, but you might need some medication and stuff, so contact your doctor. It might be one of these infections that don't go without help of pills.
NbY9OGbkaa	yes, it is ok.  I tried inhaling just a little bit once and that was a mistake!  suck as much smoke as you can as long as you don't inhale!<br>  <br>  Jeremy|`|5lfnpGmUaa	Yes it does. Try this.....smoke a cigar without inhaling. When your done, hold your lips shut and try to exhale through your mouth. When you open your mouth, smoke will come out.|`|1IbwqNBOaa	yes it does (if you don't inhale it isn't as bad though)<br>  i think you have the willpower to not smoke though|`|5Rwe4gBuaa	yes some will get into your lungs still|`|AA11417459	Um smoking a cigar is no "safer" than smoking cigarettes.  My dad "ONLY" smoked Cigars and a pipe. But he died of Lung Cancer at the age of 59. I was 17 at the time and I have never smoked a day in my life!!! P.S. I don't recommend cigarettes either... my brother smoked 2 packs a a day and died when he was 42.|`|F48RJ0E2aa	yes it still goes in your lungs....i would say yes its ok but i dont want it on my head when you get lung cancer|`|CLoXm0Idaa	Of course you get second hand smoke from even your own cigars. Most people that smoke cigars like the taste and they get nicotine from the cigar in there saliva. You can get mouth cancer from cigars just as you can from cigs. Being ok is a personal choice of yours. All tobaco products have been linked to cancer.|`|VdADhbKAaa	DON'T SMOKE!!! ITS BAD FOR U!!!|`|jW2Q7xvvaa	Your not inhaling so I don't think any smoke reaches your lungs. Don't take to deep of puffs or maybe some will seep down there. Remember cigars are meant to be sipped and savored so sit down relax and take it slow! Enjoy!|`|pyN4smlZaa	how about you just don't smoke?<br>  that should be ok for your health & your lungs.. what do u think?<br>  that's my question|`|vvPDl7Dpaa	it is okey cause i did that onces and tha smoke didn't goes to my lungs|`|vxns9mKlaa	Monika Lewinsky told me that you insert the entire cigar and hold it with your lips.
H4um5yqQaa	Well if the pain persists, you should go to a doctor who can refer you to a physical therapist. But it sounds like you have just simply overworked your quads. Make sure you are stretching before and after you run and play baseball. A combination of static and dynamic stretches will help lengthen your muscles and prevent injury. I have included two links to a great site on sports injury prevention and stretching; one for running and one for baseball.<br>  <br>  Running:<br>  <a href="http://www.thestretchinghandbook.com/archives/stretches-running.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.thestretchinghandbook.com/arc...</a><br>  <br>  Baseball:<br>  <a href="http://www.thestretchinghandbook.com/archives/stretches-baseball.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.thestretchinghandbook.com/arc...</a><br>  <br>  I hope this helps, and best of luck!|`|tqt9yg3vaa	The doctor cannot do much. Time is your friend. You want to ice your quads and rest this evening. Take some Tylenol, too. You can use heat on them tomorrow after school and the next few days. Good luck.|`|0e91bcf7aeed2ff7a179b94b59d01014aa	Your best choice is to rest it. a muscle tear just takes time to heal. Ice will help with swelling, but will make you quad stiffen up. Heat will losen the muscle up which will allow more blood flow which will cause mor pain.  Ibuprofen for inflamation and rest.
90tPT5nlaa	Like all medical problems, there are treatments for some eye health problems and not for others.|`|60bc0a55f4ad039cbdd9e5b8867b9facaa	yes they have lasik surgery. I surgeon inserts a disc into your eye then he takes a laser and points it into your eyes to correct the error.|`|5CimsCuiaa	Yes there are no of option available, go visit any clinic and Doc. will let you know as per condition|`|acc1b53b4ef1723db0d5438db0f8cb05aa	get laser treatment it cost sothing like ￡350 per eye|`|phouqBL4aa	yes they do .using laser technology.
tRzHYn5Kaa	omg! this is so weird cause my name is rebecca and im 12 and i had the exact same problem... when i got my period, a year ago! wow... freaky. anyway.. lol, uhmm... it does sometimes feel uncomfortable when you sit down or like try to touch your toes or something but normally, you shouldnt feel anything. <br>  <br>  something i realized though is that the lite ones can actually be more uncomfortable because they are too small to stay in place so they kinda slip down and then you can feel it. i suggest you try the medium ones and make sure that you put it in as far as itll go, like.. push the applicator thing a little bit and then push the tampon up more... dont worry if you get blood on your fingers... theyre washable ;P <br>  <br>  as for how long they last, the lite ones last around 5-6 hours and the other ones last about 8. they can last a little longer then that but its not safe to leave it in longer than 8 hours. dont freak though if you do it by accident, its extremely uncommon for something to go wrong (like, 1 in a million). ;) <br>  <br>  and as for your last question, this is possible if youre period is very light or if youre just practicing and dont really have your period but it shouldnt usually. <br>  <br>  i hope i helped, and good luck :D<br>  <3rebecca ;)|`|9b69f7ec8bbb37936bf7af7bfa55e317aa	Congratulations on trying something new.  You should feel a bit awkward the first few times - you will get more used to it.  At first, its normal to feel it the entire time its in, you'll feel like you walk funny and are always aware of your vagina.  As you get used to it, once its in it will seem to disappear and you wont notice it.  <br>  <br>  Lite lasts the shortest - but it all depends on your period.  You'll have to get used to how long they last for you, they are different for everyone.<br>  <br>  You feel it more when its just put in because its dry and because its just gone in.  Anything you insert into your vagina will be very noticeable at first, but then fade away as you get used to it - dry or not you will feel awkward at first.|`|BDQp9vohaa	y r u using those at that age anyway. those r dangerous. u need to use right  one at the right time. yes it does feel awkward. light 1st day or two, then medium, or if it jumps to extremely heavy then use super. also the tampax pearl are more gentle upon insertion. the others are mre harsh. the more practice itll feel better.i would suggest a panty liner just incase u dont insert properly. gl|`|Ewp79kMIaa	If it's uncomfortable, it probably means you didn't put it in far enough. I'm 14, and i just recently started using them...My advice is to stick to pads as often as you can, although they stick to your butt, they are way more comfortable. Also, tampons last about 8 hours, so don't wear them to bed if you sleep longer than that. If you have some fluid in your underwear, don't freak out it's normal. However if you get A LOT, you probably need to upgrade to a bigger size. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. xxx<br>  <br>  PS. Also visit www.playtex.com and they have LOADS of stuff on there.|`|MysAALjNaa	1. It may feel a bit awkward or new but it shouldn't hurt unless you put it in wrong.<br>  2. lite, medium, and large it all depends on your flow. If it's low, you may want to use a lite. But if your flow is heavy, you may want to use a large!<br>  3. It may feel awkward if you are using the wrong size. If you have a low flow, and you use a large tampon, it may feel dry and be hard to remove.<br>  Hope this helps!!!<br>  P.S.- let me know if this helps or if you have more questions!|`|p2HVltTBaa	For me when it is first inserted, yes it isnt the nicest thing but then i get used to it and you cant feel it anymore. When it is in you shouldnt even feel it that much, but if you can then i wouldnt take it as something really bad since it is yoir fkrst time you are probably thinking of it too much therefore, feeling it. A regular tampon can last between 4 and 8 hours, a large one about 6 because they are for heavy periods and get used up faster and lite about 6 hours.  Just make sure to change them regularly and you will be fine. xx|`|QL7ztuEOaa	1)You shouldn't really be able to feel it, i'd guess you've not quite inserted far enough into your vagina, try taking it out and putting in a new one and angling it sort of toward your back. kinda like this...   /   <br>  2) It can differ depending on the brand so check out the paper leaflet included but generally it is 4 - 6 hours<br>  3)It can feel a little bit uncomfortable at first but its one of those strange things that when you get it right you'll know.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.
iRVZNzPeaa	While it is true that waking a sleepwalker, especially forcefully, may distress them, it is an absolutely false statement that someone would die from shock.  You can startle sleepwalkers, and they can be very disoriented when you wake them up and they can have violent, or confused reactions, but there are no documented cases of someone dying from being woken up." Sleepwalking's hazard is more closely linked to what the sleepwalker may encounter when roaming about in a nocturnal reverie.<br>  <br>  There is no truth to not waking up a sleepwalker.|`|kINrWpltaa	i sleep walk! you shouldnt wake a sleep waker because its bad for the brain or something and its rather annoying because then you cant get back to sleep. you just kinda usher them back to bed! i once tried to climb out my bedroom window and almost walked off the edge of the kitchen table =] its funny when i hear what i've done!  ?|`|JcNDk7KYaa	YOU SHOULD ALWAYS WAKE A SLEEPWALKER they can really hurt themselves while they are walking around the house or even go outside and get lost or many other things|`|vK1cmzF7aa	the sudden shock of being awoken whilst standing up and not in bed can cause fear related heart attacks and even kill or put some 1 in a coma.|`|iGMeuDdjaa	the only reason you shouldnt wake sleep walkers is to watch them embarass themselves. its that simple, lol :]|`|gdzX4v2Jaa	they get mad...
