The game is not played that way.I'll tell you what's important to you right now. IT IS IMPORTANT TO FINISH YOUR EDUCATION. So make a schedule or chart and of the stuff you have to attend,complete and stick to it. Don't overload. When your day is complete put a tepid cloth on you eyes and rest. Go to a local nail salon and have them massage your hands. Buy some fruits( Oranges and carrots) aphysicallyqueeze do this for a couple of weeks.You will feel physcially energized. Practice taking deep breathes every once in awhile to increase the oxygen to the brain and body. Practice a positive mantra. Im a great student,Im a fun person, Im diligent, Im tenacious, etc.As to the gaining weight do exercises rather than weights. Find one of those  early morning exercise channels (not yoga) and aerobercise with them. Good luck.
OlzWOP2Baa	Nope.  The survey is skewed and the results are probably made up by the people who host the website.  Here is a site just like that for women <a href="http://www.the-clitoris.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.the-clitoris.com/</a> .  Both of these sites are biased.  It says the same thing that around half of the participants in one of their surveys are aroused by the female form and the other half by the male form. You have to understand that people who's sexual desires are different from the norm are more proned to seek out and participate in research experiements and opinion polls on sexuality more so then heterosexuals because we are considered the norm and don't give as much thought on sexuality.  Some people who are percieved as different become obessed with analyzing and promoting their difference, especially in a society in which they are degraded and persecuted.  They just want acceptence, but force-feeding their views on others isn't going to go over well to most.<br>  <br>  Another article <a href="http://seedmagazine.com/news/2005/10/girls_gone_wildfor_monkeys.php" rel="nofollow">http://seedmagazine.com/news/2005/10/gir...</a> states that women are turned on by sexual images in general.  Doesn't matter if it's men, women or bonobos having intercourse.  According to the reasercher women are turned on by sex in general.  As a general rule most people think watching animal or child porn is sickning.  However, this women says women are turned on by watching animals mate as long as it's sex.  So my question to her or women who agree with the study would be since it is a sex, do you also become aroused by child porn?  OF COURSE NOT! Unless she is a peadophile.  So I don't think most would be aroused by monkey porn or by a porn that doesnt't match her sexual orienetation.  She would find it boring or disgusting.  Again, the author's attitude and feelings toward sexuality is shown through her experiment, much like the sex researcher Alfred Kinsey.<br>  <br>  This article is about homophobic men.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://66.102.1.104/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=cache:OuUWXezMbF8J:www.oogachaga.com/downloads/homophobia_and_homosexual_arousal.pdf+" rel="nofollow">http://66.102.1.104/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=...</a><br>  It states that a majority of men who are homophoic straight men are aroused by gay male porn or have homosexual feelings.    It's pretty easy to see that it's false.   More or less it says that men who are grossed out or think homosexuality is wrong are secretly homosexual or bisexual themselves.   If a person disagrees with homosexuality, then they must be one themselves.  It's main goal is accetance of homosexuality.   Which I don't mind, but when they start telling me what I like, I get annoyed.<br>  <br>  Straight people just don't feel aroused by the same-sex.  It's the reason we are straight.  We don't feel the least bit bi-curious.<br>  <br>  I know bullsh*t when I read it.|`|VXxYd0Wwaa	Maybe it's some kind of feminist propaganda aimed to discredit men. lol|`|gLMhG9fVaa	*psh*|`|iHKJsyfTaa	I don't buy it. Not even a little.<br>  <br>  Maybe a guy banging a chick, but not just a guy by himself.|`|vEj7xoBraa	surveys are f*cking stupid.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	Well, we have to remember that it's a JackinWorld survey.  The people surveyed are not a random, representative sample of the rest of the population, but of the people who use JackinWorld.  It can definitely be argued that many people with their own questions about their sexuality go to JackinWorld for answers.<br>  <br>  But yes, it does make sense to me.  As someone else pointed out, male genitals do have the benefit of showing you when they're aroused and being more visually stimulating than female genitals.<br>  <br>  And let's not forget that porn is NOT necessarily a reflection on true desires; what you like to watch to get off doesn't mean that you're the same as what you're watching.  It doesn't mean that these guys are secretly gay or bisexual or something.  It just means that they find such porn and fantasies to be more stimulating.|`|WKyPDbglaa	I would suspect it being bogus. Online surveys can be distorted, unless it is a scientific peer reviewed study I wouldn't give it a passing glance. <br>  <br>      And it could be biased because of an editor or employee fiddling with the numbers.|`|m36fw7Mqaa	Sounds exaggerated, but a male might appreciate aesthetic form.|`|8ldA7Z3Baa	I totally disagree that most guys are more turned on by the male body. I'm certainly not.<br>  <br>  But about the male genitals....If thats true then the reason many guys may be more aroused by the look of aroused male genitals than female genitals, is because you can visually see the arousal happen during the sex in say, porn. Watching someone elses penis get large and go inside a vagina simply reminds guys of their own penis and how good it feels to do the same. (why else in porn does the director have the camera focus on just that for the audience) Nothing gay about it unless the guy who is getting turned on by the sight of a penis is getting turned on by the idea of really being with a guy himself in real life.<br>  <br>  You don't usually see female genitals become aroused since nothing grows out of it and expands. Only when juices are visible does it becomes visually arousing. It's usually how the girl herself is feeling and what she may be doing to her vagina thats visually arousing, not just the vag itself.<br>  <br>  EDIT: By the way, most sexuality tests, even though created by "scientist" are bogus and not very scientific when you really think about how they're making their judgments.<br>  <br>  EDIT: ineto - I agree with some of what you say, but there are a few flaws in your statement. Like for example, when you say no girls/women are turned on by child porn. In actuality, in Manga (asian comic books called anime), there is an entire genre of child porn written by women for women. Sure, it's not real life porn, they're only cartoons, but child porn is the basis of the plots. Usually the story is about strange love between young feminine boys with older boys. And usually about a 12 year old boy getting raped by an 18 year old, who later loves the 18 year old boy after it happens. Just look up "Yaoi" or "Loveless" and you'll see the proof. I was suprised too but girls/women can be just as dirty as some guys, only when women are into this, it's considered 'cute'.
AA11890416	I'm really sorry to hear this. It isn't up to you to ask how they should or shouldn't deal with it though. All you can do is be there for them if they need to talk. You don't even have to say anything. Just let them vent if they wish and there's no need to fill the silences. If you are having trouble with this yourself then you can seek counseling to talk it through in a constructive manner. Their grief and confusion is theirs to work through though. If you feel the need to take a role then offer to cook or offer childcare or driving or whatever you can. I know you care and that is wonderful but it's a very complex situation. Make sure you don't forget to grieve your own way while worrying about the parents.|`|uYJdvnqxaa	They should definitely go see a counselor together as a family.

Do you want your career to be in business, and does -that- inspire you? <br>  <br>  Would you rather:<br>  A). Have an easier time getting a job that you won't necessarily enjoy<br>  or<br>  B). Have a harder time finding a job....but a long shot that you might enjoy the job?<br>  <br>  Those are questions only you can answer but might help you along in the process. <br>  <br>  Do you have an alternate plan? Write down the pros and cons before making any rash decision. <br>  <br>  Just look at your life in both the short and long range and be realistic about what you can accomplish. Envision different scenarios and base that on how you've felt in the past.  One thing that is an excellent predictor of future happiness is past behavior/reactions. We are all creatures of habit and will often repeat a behavior pattern. <br>  <br>  You've also got to think practically. Do you honestly think that anything you're learning in the program is something you can use? Maybe it really is useless, and your getting the papers off the net is your way of saying that you won't really need the info and it is a waste of time.  Or maybe you've resigned from the whole spiel and don't want any part of business. Only you know your own mind.

Reducing a relationship to finances is crass and smacks of prostitution.  I do agree with "whoever asks pays" in general, but when I have been out with a man more than a couple of times, no matter who asks who out, I've always offered to pick up the tab every other time, so we both pay about the same amount of times.  And before you bring that up, yes, I have paid for a nice steak dinner as well as breakfast at Denny's so I'm not just paying for the cheap meals.  If I was the first to ask a man out in a dating situation, I would expect to be the one paying, and would expect the same if he did the asking.  The only exception is my current boyfriend.  He knows that I am currently in a precarious financial situation for at least the next couple of years, and being as he literally makes over 4 times my salary, it's not unreasonable for him to do the paying, and he does without complaint or whining.  but he also knows that I do not take advantage of the situation.

vwZvxNevaa	Well I am 18 about to go to college and i'm really scared. I am confident that I can do it because my parents always tell me that they are behind me 100% and never to be scared to fail. Don't let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game. They also tell me if I fall they will help lift me back up.

SAgCy83Oaa	Did you pull a Rip Van Winkle and sleep through last year's stimulus check?  If so, maybe you can still get that one.  But if you got one the last time, then you have obviously missed just about every news broadcast or newspaper/magazine that has come out for at least 9 months - no new checks for individuals, unless you are on Social Security, in which case you will get $250.

68e6778f68d4febab53279e39853dda0aa	This test sounds like a bunch of hoopla. But I guess some people are too impatient to wait for a sonogram. Personally I've started picking names for my children: 5 for boys and 3 for girls. <br>  <br>  Although I don't intend to have those many kids, nor do I care about who comes when. All I know is that I just want them and I like surprises (good surprises, not "my kid has CP" surprises). \|`|ibaLRXY2aa	I think if it were me, I'd save my $150-250 and wait for the sonogram.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't say that abortionists have a Catch-22. I'd say they're hypocrites. Glamour magazine is very pro-abortion, and I was appalled by an article that they ran once condemning women in India or someplace like that for aborting daughters. They think that abortion is okay for reasons like "I'm not ready to be a parent" and "It makes me a better parent to the kid I already have" and "I don't want stretch marks," yet they condemn these women for doing what they need to survive.<br>  <br>  But anyway, I agree with you. Aborting a baby because you wanted the other gender is appalling.|`|nvH62xo5aa	You don't have to abort your daughter to survive, you just have to give birth to a son.|`|IWWZdZRpaa	Don't most people find out what they are having anyway?  Abolishing this test won't change that.  I don't think the purpose of the test is to encourage aborting, it's probably a way to make money off of people who don't feel like waiting.<br>  <br>  Now you make a good point when you say "I can't tell someone what to do with HER body"  Well, using that argument who are you to tell a woman whether or not her decision to have an abortion is a valid one.  It's a Catch 22.  Pro choice people say her body her choice but when her choice is one that people don't agree with, the argument changes.|`|XeH5FPM5aa	How can that test tell your baby's gender if gender is a social contruct?|`|gHxmYuGmaa	Wanting to know the baby's sex in itself is not a bad thing.  Aborting based on the answer is a hideous thought.<br>  <br>  However, in order to implant an embryo, don't fertility lab doctors test tube several embryos and let you choose the one you want to implant based on sex?<br>  <br>  It's not that different..|`|9VAnsWYUaa	"This 'test' should be abolished.". Thanks for sharing your opinion. I think every parent deserves the right to know details about their kid. Not saying that the sex of the kid should make a difference. Knowledge, that's all.|`|YQOT68xFaa	I doubt it works reliably. And I agree that the test should be abolished. Aborting because baby is the wrong gender is sick.<br>  <br>  That said....do you think it's any better to abort a baby because it is unwanted or inconvenient? That's just as sick.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Feminecronomicon - I had to LOL at your answer. Hilarious.

PI8VfiY1aa	The most horrifically terrifying example I can give you (I mean terrifying like to the point of panic) isn't really a nightmare, but the condition called Sleep Paralysis. Much scarier than a nightmare by FAR. <br>  <br>  It's when you literally wake up from a dream, but your body remains paralyzed by the acetychlorine released during REM sleep- you can move your eyes and even look around but nothing else. You then experience hallucinations that someone is in the room with you- either watching over your bedside, moving toward you, or attacking you. They usually appear in the form of shadows, or distorted humanoid forms (think of the ghost from the Grudge). You can literally see them, hear them, and feel them, but you cannot move your body. It's especially horrifying because you know you're not dreaming, and it seems to really be happening. <br>  I speak from experience- I have been struggling with a sleep disorder lately, and consequentially experienced 3 episodes of sleep paralysis in the last month. Scariest moments of my life- and this is coming from a guy who usually laughs at horror films. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paral...</a><br>  image examples here <br>  <a href="http://www.ghost-pictures.org/images/ghost-in-bed.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.ghost-pictures.org/images/gho...</a><br>  <a href="https://webspace.utexas.edu/cokerwr/www/slides/dreams/nightmare.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://webspace.utexas.edu/cokerwr/www/...</a><br>  <a href="http://yuan.darkfathom.com/digi/Sleep_Paralysis.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://yuan.darkfathom.com/digi/Sleep_Pa...</a><br>  <a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/152/358740478_583ecba54b.jpg?v=1169222959" rel="nofollow">http://farm1.static.flickr.com/152/35874...</a><br>  <br>  Perhaps you can do a story where these people think they're experiencing sleep paralysis, but it turns out to be something more supernatural. Perhaps even they have to work together to uncover the mystery behind it.|`|5eoO6qosaa	Being alone at the family house. Very pleasant  evening, stars starting to twinkle, finally cooling off from a hot summers day.  I'm standing on the front steps, enjoying the light breeze, when the lilac bush on the far side of the yard, cracks and moves and then a large black snarling panther type cat can be seen, crouched ready to jump. I catch my breath and turn and run into the house, slam the door and lock it. and start breathing again. I'm backing away while looking at the door and I hear a thump and then large claws start tearing through the panel in the door and that is where I always wake up, gasping for breathe.|`|KCpGsN2faa	I had one back when I was 12ish. I was in it along with my mom and 2 younger brothers. We lived in this 1 story brick house in some town, and this occult stole my youngest brother. We finally found him at Wal-Mart wearing only a diaper. We then moved to this 2 story drab grayish house in the country, there were trees all over. There was a nieghbor's house I could see from the back of the house. I was in the backyard with these white trash cracked out kids (who were brother and sister) and my brother (not the one who had been kidnapped). They were trying to convince us to do meth with them. I told them to screw off, but they were startin to convince my brother. I decided to go inside and get my mom to get her help. She was too busy talking and hanging out with a friend. So I went back outside. The leader of the occult had been following us, and he found us at the house. He had a black top hat but the very top, flat part was broken, it lay half-way up. He had on this weird dark (trench?) coat on. His clothes were kind of tattered, they looked like a crazy hobo's clothing. He crossed this little walk-way bridge and came to the backyard. He did this while I was inside. When I got out, the trashy kids were there, and they were freakin out. My brother was gone, as well as the occult leader. There was fresh blood all over this snow mound. It spelled something out, but as soon as I woke up I forgot what it said:( That's when my dream ended, I woke up around dawn and cried for about a good hour, did not go to bed the rest of the day.|`|82FuhGKaaa	My sister died, I was crying so hard and I was holding her and when I woke up my face was really wet and my nose was stuffed.

The christening gown a symbol of her blessing.|`|qtCVLDFxaa	Seems that you subconsciously felt you needed your mom's approval about something. Babies in dreams can obviously mean offspring, but also projects or something new that is beginning. A white christening gown could symbolize innocence and being accepted into a community (ie the christian family officially recognizes the newborn by baptism).<br>  So if you have a new project and are worried about what people around you will think, your mom says its all systems go, take the plunge !
Wl98QzeSaa	This statement is strongly based on the opinion of the writer of your textbook.<br>  I suspect what is meant is that the events that occurred throughout history are slowly advancing civilization in a similar way to stages of evolution slowly advancing the biology of living beings.  <br>  Two assumptions are required to make this statement:<br>  1 - that evolution is a process that is improving living beings, and <br>  2 - the events of history reflect an advancement in people.<br>  <br>  I don't buy either premise.<br>  1 - environmental factors have predominantly negative effect, and mutations are exclusively detrimental. <br>  2 - history reflects the cycles of ignorance overwhelming enlightenment repeating ad infinitum.<br>  <br>  It would be more accurate to say that some civilizations attempt to improve themselves, but few actively protect themselves against those who don't.  Eventually the ignorant many take offense at the enlightened few, and the force of numbers determines the violent result.<br>  It is the survival of the lowest common element of society at the expense of the best.

Think about a scary dream that you've had off and on since you were really young, one of those "monster chasing you" dreams. Think about the dream during the day, about how you would do something different in it, like, NOT run into that building where something GETS you time after time.  Think about NOT going into that building.  Go to bed.  Think about NOT going into that building.  Think about . . .then dream the dream half awake, half asleep . . .DON"T go into that building. You'll fall asleep and, if not the first night, soon enough, you'll carry the lucidity of your wakeful thoughts about the dream into deep sleep stages. To lucidly dream, carry some of your wakeful consciousness down into sleep with you. And, don't forget NOT to go in that building.  : )|`|382e291aa8e1f4c0b3636f373514ea23aa	IN your waking life pay close attention to everything around you all the time. Let no detail go un noticed.<br>  About 15 times a day ask yourself if you are dreaming. This is called reality checking. After you practice doing this for a while you will start to have lucid dreams. I have them about once a month and there is nothing in the world as fun. but you have to always be checking reality in waking life to have them.<br>  YOu can rub your hands together several times a day as a reality check, then you can do it in a dream to see if it is a dream. In a lucid dream this will prolong the dream.<br>  Also in a lucid dream you can turn around a few times-it feels like you are in molassis when you do this in a lucid dream--and it changes the dream setting. Usually I like to fly in a lucid dream, or grab someone and have sex, and next time it happens I plan to touch people and things as much as possible. I love to go around and explore all the things in the dream when I am lucid, touching walls, opening doors, looking at all the details very closely, and asking people in the dream if they know they are in my dream. They always just smile and don't say anything.

Honestly, it's quite a part of growing and anyone who has ever been your age has gone through something of this nature.<br>  <br>  I encourge you to be the adult in this situation and don't lower yourself to fighting, yelling or blatantly being defiant.  As others have said before me, you're more likely to get what you want if you can be calm about it and talk with maturity and intellect.<br>  <br>  The one word that I love is, "compromise."  I think that your mother and you should go clothes shopping together and you can show her all of the clothes that you would like to wear, and then maybe she can find some of the clothes that you like to wear acceptable.<br>  <br>  Or perhaps there can be days where you're allowed to wear whatever you feel like without her saying anything about it.  Many places of employment do this and call it "casual Friday."  Not that I'm saying it has to be limited to one day...

Maybe you can go to the mall together and compromise on some outfits that have "large" pants but with tops or accessories that she thinks are appropriate. Try to explain to her why you are comfortable wearing the pants you like, she probably thinks that you are only dressing that way to rebel against her. Chances are, your style will change as you get older (i know mine has), and your mom doesn't want you to be labeled as a certain type of person just because of your clothes.

Be prepared, almost all jobs will allow only certain types of clothing.  Certain places won't allow you to enter depending on what you are wearing.  Instead of talking about your mom, why don't you talk TO her.  Don't start an argument, just explain to her that you like the way you dress and you want to understand why she doesn't agree with you.  If you keep the conversation mature (and don't start yelling) you may both find a common ground and everyone's life will be a whole lot easier.

People can have a ruff sense of humor for many reasons than just self esteem issues. It really depends on the context of this person is really saying.<br>  <br>   If someone has to always state their intent after their action it obviously wasn't clear enough to begin with. People interpret humor differently. I have a rather extreme and out there sense of humor but, when I'm using it people often know because of the context and way I voice it.<br>  <br>   Sometimes people use humor to hide or avoid what they really feel. To give things less meaning. They may do it to distance themselves from people and avoid emotions. You have to explain to the person how their words really effect you on a serious level. They may not even believe you or, just not care or really get the full impact.<br>  <br>   Sometimes it's part of peoples personalities to be highly critical of what's around them. And even desensitize things. When people consider something that offends another as a joke they usually intend it to be. But, they often do not think about how it will effect someone else or understand fully how it effects other people. It is hard for some to take into consideration how other people think and interpret things differently. I see religious signs in windows of general stores that offends me. Perhaps the store owners do not care that there is more than one religion or no one has said anything the right way.<br>  <br>   Tell the person flat out to respect you and they may. You need to put this person in their place but, do it respectively and consider they probably have a high ego to be so critical to make jokes so often. They may have low self esteem and mask it with humor.<br>  <br>   If this person says things repetitively that they know bothers you or in the same area either they don't care about your feelings. Or they have a problem expressing their thoughts and feelings in a positive way. Perhaps their is a conflict they do not know how to resolve other than making you see the humor in it. But, by the way you say "rude remarks" I dought it is that constructive.|`|9cb5ec4e066bdd6c671cc6bc2a33d580aa	YES. That can be perceived as a form of abuse.<br>  <br>  I recommend you IGNORE him, always. Or, at least until he changes his tone toward you.|`|AA11643070	Yes it is a form of abuse it seems that guy is into mental games.|`|09917495816f4485b1a8c7ecb3187621aa	Yes.Maybe he secretly envies you ,and he's trying to bring you down to his own perceived level.|`|AA10102722	It is emotional abuse.  If his intent was to be funny, then he would tell jokes that don't involve rude, personal attacks on you.<br>  <br>  His problem is that his self-esteem is so low that he feels he must make fun of others to feel better about himself.  Sometimes these people are rude to everyone and sometimes they are rude to just a few people or only one person.  If they’re physically attractive, then they’ll usually only be rude to a few people, in order to fool most people into thinking they’re nice guys.  If they’re not very attractive, they’ll usually be rude to most people since they know that no one will make an extra effort to put up with their cruelty.<br>  <br>  It’s important to remember, though, that you are not doing this guy any favors by sticking with him and enabling him to continue this abusive behavior.  There's nothing wrong with him having low self-esteem (we all have low self-esteem at some point in our lives) but there is something wrong him dealing with his self-esteem by emotionally abusing others.  Try to help him deal with his problems in healthier ways.  If that doesn't work after a brief period of time (it’s up to you to decide how much of a “chance” to give him) week, then cut your losses and stop enabling him to be involved in behaviors that are destructive to both him and you.|`|e7c9a73cb63432cbaa04d26edad41bf5aa	If he does it very often and if it offensive to you then it may be abuse. If you have asked him to stop and he continues to so so, the it is abuse. Does he do it to get a laugh out of other around you? If so, then it is abuse but he doesn't see it that way. No matter what the circumstances are, it needs to stop. If he won't stop, then cut off contact with him. There are too many good people in the world to spend you time with people who only want to bring you down. Don't snip back at him though because then you will be on his level. The only reason people tease others spitefully is because they feel intimidated by the object of his/her teasing. They want to bring the person down, to raise themselves up.|`|05fe207ba2c172effa44a53cd561b351aa	He is NOT joking at all. That guy who always make rude remarks are really made rude remarks indeed.  He did it purposefully, not for joking or humor at all. <br>  He really makes rude remarks because something inside him triggers him to say and make rude remarks.<br>  He cannot control something inside him that make him makes rude remarks. He even doesn't know why he made rude remarks....<br>  Because he doesn't know why he made such a rude remark, ALL he can do is just say he was kidding. Because when people ask him why he made rude remarks... even he, himself, cannot find the answer to himself why he did that.<br>  <br>  Those who have something hideous inside themselves brought from the past, are those who tend to make or say rude remarks unconsciously. Really.... they even really don't know WHY they make rude remarks. Instead of apologizing, also triggered with self-prided and self-righteousness, they say it's only joking. While in reality is NOT joking at all. They simply don't know why they made rude remarks. But psychologically, brought to them from the their unhappy and dark past.  Something unsolved and unanswered from their past haunt them -unconsciously- until triggers them to make such rude remarks towards other. <br>  Rude remarks could be considered as emotional abuse if pointed and aimed continually to the defenseless ones (including children). <br>  ;)|`|d5348844fa0d0a525f373ae1f2bf3a78aa	if you still feel like you've been hurt after he apologizes, then it sure is. people can say things in a joking way, but it can still hurt. there's no such thing as rude jokes. just like there's no such thing as constructive critism. it doesn't matter how good the person's intentions are, it still hurts.

6e7b70d76ca035c4d786ff07443958e0aa	People typically want to talk about themselves so just ask them what they like to do and try to relate. You can find sometinhg in common with anyone, typical topics are family, music and movie likes/dislikes, the weather ( I know, cliche), sports, etc. <br>  <br>  Most quiet people feel they have to say something really smart or cool to fit in, actually most conversation is basic, that's why its called "small talk." <br>  <br>  If you go to someones house or are in their environement you can look around and tell exactly what they like by looking at what's on the walls or in pictures and talk about it. <br>  <br>  Or just look at what they wear and you can tell a personality and should have an idea of what they like. If not just say something like, have you gone to the movies lately? (or something you have done) Then they will give an opinion and you can take it from there, if they hate movies then you now know something about them and can move on, you don't always have to agree with everyone. Ask about what music they like next, until you are comforatable you may go through similar steps with all new people.|`|3a2355dfd94fd7e2ce3ee072caec36b1aa	This is a complex question because the only answer is for you to put yourself out there more frequently, which as a shy person can be hard to do.  I recommend going out with a group of friends so that you can get to know more people beyond your circle.  For example, if a friend invites you to hang out with some other friends, just do it.  This will give you the opportunity to meet new people while still feeling somewhat comfortable.  Other ideas could focus on activities that make you feel good or comfortable.  If you enjoy reading, skydiving, sports, or even video games chances are there are a group of people in the same city who do.  If you can find a club or a group of these people you can meet new friends that way.  Lastly, think about what you want in a friend and try to project those qualities when you meet someone.  So if you want someone to listen and be open-minded with you, then you should begin a friendship that way.  Hope this helps.|`|301e7e0e807dffc27869c1ea860db1feaa	Budweiser Select.|`|137e6738245df7cdd762ae2969cefa5daa	I am still quite shy myself, but the key to becoming more outgoing is to build your self esteem.

This is what an opportunist looks like:<br>  <br>  1. The gossip who wants to destroy your relationships because of jealosy.<br>  2. The co-worker who will find a way to discredit your career to exalt themselves.<br>  3.  People who are interested in how much money you make.  Why?  <br>  4.  These people don't respect boundaries.  They don't understand that you are busy.  They try to use guilt to manipulate if you say you are not comfortable with something.<br>  <br>  I have had to sort of break up with these people, which made me the enemy, in their eyes.

Boxenluder..sehn doch Klasse aus...<br>  Ansonsten mal grunds?tzlich ..die Zeiten sind vorbei, wo ich einer Frau vorschreiben kann, was sie zu tun und zu lassen hat, meine Moral muss nicht die Ihre sein, wir leben in einer freien demokratischen Gesellschaft und wenn eine Frau sich aufregend sexy erotisch kleiden oder benehmen will..Sex mit mehreren M?nnern oder Frauen will oder mit wemm auch immer nur zu!!<br>  Porstitution ist auch legal!<br>  Den Begriff Luder verwenden doch dann nur Menschen aus Neid oder überkommenen Moralvorstellungen heraus....|`|f5406a52d1297317de11e18d2bb48aecaa	ich denke mal das Word "Luder" ist eine M?nnererfindung.<br>  Es drückt die ANGST des Mannes aus, an ein Solches zu geraten und sich dabei zu verlieren oder dem nicht gewachsen zu sein.<br>  <br>  Sich Nackt an Teppichen oder Boxen zu r?ckeln, langt beiweitem nicht zum Luder-Titel - also wird dieses Wort  meistens auch noch falsch verwendet!<br>  Von M?nnern halt!|`|defadcd6e3a12df9e6913ff584d68e75aa	Wenn sie diese Eigenschaften aufweist:<br>  <br>  Als Promiskuit?t (von lat. promiscus gemeinsam, promiscere vorher mischen) wird die Praxis eines nicht an langfristigen Bindungen orientierten Geschlechtsverkehrs mit verschiedenen Partnern bezeichnet; promiskuitiv (adj) wird auch verwendet für ?sexuell freizügig oder offenherzig“.<br>  <br>  Soll promiskes Verhalten von Mann und Frau unterschieden werden, so existieren dafür die Ausdrücke Satyriasis für M?nner und Nymphomanie für Frauen; diese Begriffe werden jedoch nicht formal-diagnostisch angewandt, und der Partnerwechsel ist dabei auch nicht zwingend.<br>  <br>  Es ist in vielen F?llen ein wertender Ausdruck, mit dem der Missbilligung einer für den Sprecher ?zu hohen“ Zahl von Sexualpartnern Ausdruck verliehen wird. Der eingenommene Standpunkt bei einer solchen Bewertung kann beispielsweise sein, dass Sexualit?t nur der Fortpflanzung dienen sollte oder dass Menschen zumindest das Ziel anstreben sollten, einen Partner für eine einzige, lebenslang andauernde Beziehung zu finden. Umgangssprachlich werden die Adjektive promisk oder auch promiskuitiv in abwertender Weise synonym für ?sexuell freizügige“ Personen gebraucht.<br>  <br>  .

Una volta ibn una prigione un tizio mai arrestato prima fu suttoposto al ''bertillonage'' e fu rimproverato per non aver detto di essere gia arrestato, perchè aveva caratteristiche identiche ad un altro progiudicato.......Questo fatto portò poi alla adozione dappertutto delle impronte digitali.<br>  <br>  Quindi l'identità apparente può esistere, ma con i metodi di oggi del dna non più.|`|oz8Opbzeaa	si anche se non peroprio identicoin tutto

w0lNzMn5aa	Beh, in linea di massima potrebbe ben adattarsi all'universo femminile, noi donne tendiamo sempre ad essere un po' misteriose o cmq a lasciare un'alone di dubbio in ogni cosa che facciamo.<br>  Credo che questo atteggiamento sia un'eredità della condizione della donna nei secoli scorsi, a partire dalle donne dell'Antico Egitto, coi loro misteriosi rituali, al gineceo nell'antica casa greca, un luogo solo per donne dove era negato l'accesso a qualsiasi uomo. <br>  Per non parlare delle streghe nel Medioevo: probabilmente è proprio da qui che si crea l'associazione donna = mistero, alimentendo tutte le credenze e le dicerie che le donne siano esseri sensibili alle tentazioni demoniache, come già le concepivano gli Antichi Romani in correlazione alle  mestruazioni femminili (addirittura credevano che non si dovesse avvicinare una donna durante !quei giorni", poiché c'era il rischio che si potesse subìre un'influenza comunque maligna).<br>  Questa stessa manifestazione tipicamente femminile è ancora un po' un mistero, anche per la scienza attuale, visto che non sono ancora ben chiari alcuni meccanismi come l'esatta origine dei dolori mestruali.... e perciò, anche la donna stessa è un enigma sul quale chissà se si riuscirà a fare mai luce.<br>  Per quel che riguarda l'universo maschile, non credo che la tua affermazione sia applicabile: gli uomini a volte sono così prevedibili! Potrebbe esserlo solo se si parla di carisma e fascino personale.|`|2a9921b489cf880266d9d1f93badcbffaa	beh....  ci  sono  donne  che  sanno  fare  benissimo  le  misteriose  e  giocano   su  questa  qualità....  ma  ci  sono  che  sanno  essere  trasparenti   e  sanno  il  fatto  loro  senza  dover  ricorrere  a  doppi   sensi  e  allusioni di  tipo  sessuale....|`|af54fc22a02841daa1e85c3013f0e1d5aa	il mistero è  femmina  e  quindi  perchè non  scoprirlo  piano piano.|`|veT9GYN7aa	le donne sono un bellissimo mondo ancora tutto da scoprire,e chi crede di averle conosciute bene si sbaglia di grosso!|`|1TNHcvYkaa	puo' essere applicabile perche dipende quanto vuoi entrare in questa nube di mistero. una cosa pero' è sicura. alla fine quando sarai andato piu' o meno in fondo ti accorgerai  che il mistero si risolve per tutte. sono tutte delle stronze|`|b5a764b3b3871811c66bce00bad97a0baa	Non so come fosse un tempo, ma so solo che adesso è composto in massima parte da bimbette isteriche, viziate, capricciose, immature, narcisiste, egocentriche, egoiste ed esibizioniste che vogliono tutto e subito senza il minimo sforzo. Vogliono tutto per sé, essere importanti senza dare importanza, essere al centro della scena e dell'attenzione e sanno solo lamentarsi e piagnucolare. Che addossano la responsabilità dei loro problemi agli altri e non sanno assumersene per sé, che vogliono diritti senza volere alcun dovere.<br>  Deludente direi, molto deludente!|`|ee60d8e7bdfaa4ba387353cd1b6ad0a1aa	l'universo femminile nn esiste, come quello maskile, al limite esistono modi di fare piu comuni ad un sesso rispetto ke a un altro x questioni fisiche o di mentalità.

Ich kann ein bisschen Handlesen, und sehe wie sich die Handlinien innert kürzester Zeit ?ndern k?nnen. Das Schicksal ist also teilweise vorbestimmt, ein unklarer Fahrplan also. Das das wirklich so ist, konnte ich an meiner eigenen Hand feststellen. Als ich mit Handlesen anfing war ich ca. 15 Jahre alt und meine Lebenslinie sagte voraus, dass ich h?chstens 35 Jahre alt werde, durch meinen Lebenswandel hat sich tats?chlich die Lebenslinie ge?ndert, ich bin heute 46 und meine Lebenslinie geht bis ca. 70 Jahre.....|`|AA10353897	An Deiner Stelle würde ich das alles vergessen.<br>  Denn an Deinem Beispiel sehe ich: D hast das Thema mit negativem Denken "vorbelastet".<br>  Es gibt etliche andere Beispiele zum selben Thema - denk z.B. einmal an Motivationstraining oder positives Denken (auch das ist erlernbar)<br>  Kontrolliere Dich einaml selbst: Vesuche mal alles positiv zu formulieren.<br>  Beispiel Prüfung: Denke nicht "Ich falle durch" sondern sieh es als: "Das ist eine Herausforderung an mich" "Ich kann das schaffen" "Was andere k?nnen, kann ich auch"<br>  Das sind alles positive Denkweisen, die Dich zu einem Menschen machen, der "Glück" hat.<br>  Dann ist es Dir auch egal wenn Du durch die Prüfung f?llst, Du siehst es nicht als vernichtende Prphetie sondern nur als Hindernis auf Deinem Wege, das Du bew?ltigen oder umgehen kannst - ganz wie Du es willst.|`|b457f56ed500ffe24a26658642ea691aaa	Ich kann mich nur zu genau an viele Gespr?che mit der inzwischen geschiedenen Frau eines Freundes erinnern. Sie glaubte fest daran, in absehbarer Zeit geschieden zu sein. Viele Jahre vor der Scheidung.<br>  Auf meinen Einwand "Und, warum tust du nichts dagegen?" reagierte sie ausweichend. H?tte sie dieses Gefühl als Warnsignal erkannt, dann h?tte die Ehe sicher eine Chance gehabt. Sie hat es aber vorgezogen, sich ihrem Schicksal zu fügen. Dabei war die Frau vom Typ her ein intelligenter Kopfmensch. Sie h?tte es besser wissen k?nnen!<br>  <br>  <br>  Ja, ich glaube daran, dass man ein Unglück auch f?rmlich herbeireden kann. Und warum sollte das Glück zu mir kommen, wenn ich nicht an das Glück glaube und ihm entgegeneile?<br>  <br>  Ob im Guten wie im Schlechten, man kann sich durch seine Grundhaltung durchaus der Vorhersehung ann?hern. Wenn ich mich nicht von selbst in die gewünschte Richtung bewege, überlasse ich den Ereigniseintritt dem Zufall oder dem Handeln anderer. Ich habe gewiss nicht alles in der Hand, was in meinem Leben passiert. Aber dem einen oder anderen Ereignis kann ich ausweichen oder aber mich ihm ann?hern.<br>  <br>  Auch wenn es so etwas bei objektiver Betrachtung nicht geben sollte, einer aktiven Lebenshaltung ist klar der Vorzug zu geben! Wozu haben wir sonst dieses undefinierbare "ungute Gefühl"???<br>  <br>  Wer im Lotto gewinnen will, der muss auch Lotto spielen.<br>  <br>  Deshalb lautet auch eine meiner Lebensmaximen "Wenn es mir hilft, dann glaube ich eben an den Weihnachtsmann!"|`|56341e135d6ccf1016d1dbf82947ada8aa	naklar negatives zieht negaives an ist ein naturgesetzt immer sch?n positiv denken wenn es nicht immer einfach ist|`|VhnbBNxyaa	Auf jeden Fall. Und ich habe auch schon positive Erfahrungen damit gemacht. Früher habe ich mich oft selber blockiert, weil ich alles negativ sah. Es kam, wie es kommen musste: selbst erfüllende Prophezeiung! Aber seit ich es mit positivem Denken versucht habe, (warum sollte ich es nicht umgekehrt auch für mich nutzen k?nnen?), ging alles viel leichter und besser. Man ?ffnet sich für die bessere M?glichkeit. Kann ich jedem nur empfehlen.<br>  <br>  Und die beste selbst erfüllende Prophezeiung: Ich werde nicht krank.

Sento le parole soffocate dalle lacrime e non capisco niente, poco dopo le sue parole mi rimbombano in testa..."non c'è più!perchè?perchè??" è tutto ciò che ho sentito e mi è bastato per svenire davanti al telefono, con le lacrime agli occhi vado in bagno poi mi ricompongo e faccio finta che sia tutto un sogno, non so per quale motivo, ma non mi rendevo conto che...era successo veramente, il mio peggior incubo...Mi ha lasciato così, senza niente tra le mani, senza niente che mi possa far ricordare il suo sorriso o il suo bellissimo strizzare gli occhi quando si spaventa, la sua paura innata per i ragni e tutti quei piccoli particolare che io sapevo di lui e lui sapeva di me...Quel giorno ogni squillo di telefono mi faceva stare male...ne arriva un'altro...è una mia compagna di classe, un nostro amico non sta tanto bene ed è all'ospedale...sorpreso come non mai inizio a ridere, cioè!??!!a ridere...credevo sul serio che fosse un sogno ...tra le risate le lacrime non riuscivo più a soffocare...corro tra il campo e inizio ad urlare, forte , come non mai...sento il telefono che squilla...è lei!è la mia ragazza!qualcuno con cui posso parlare, rispondo e gli dico:"devo raccontarti tante cose...oggi è proprio una giornata no..." e inizio a cercare di soffocare ciò che poteva essere il mio cuore che se ne andava attraverso le mie lacrime...la sua risposta :"scusa...non voglio sapere niente, ora non ti considero più come il mio ragazzo ma solo come un amico, mi dispiace..."

Wegen mir br?uchte es weder Harz 4 noch Armut zu geben und würde mich freuen wenn es allen Menschen gut gehen würde aber dann finden die Menschen wieder etwas Anderes was sie untereinander neiden.|`|iBLDy8dmaa	Es ist kein Sozialneid sondern echte Not und Besorgnis, die das friedliche Miteinander in Deutschland gef?hrden. Nicht die Armen und Unterprivilegierten sind das Risiko, sondern die Ma?losen, Gierigen, Wohlhabenden oder Reichen. Es wird niemals verst?ndlich sein, da? Managergeh?lter im Millionenbereich gezahlt werden und gleichzeitig gut verdienende Firmen ihre Mitarbeiter in gro?er Zahl als Arbeitslose auf die Strasse schicken. Es wird niemals verst?ndlich sein, wenn Politiker HartzIV-Empf?nger wegen Faulheit und Ma?losigkeit ma?regeln, wenn sie sich gleichzeitig die Taschen füllen und sich nebenbei lukrative Posten zuschieben. Und es wird niemals verst?ndlich sein, wenn Menschen in Arbeitsverh?ltnisse gedr?ngt werden, in dem man ihre Not ausnutzt, und von denen sie niemals ihren Lebensunterhalt bestreiten k?nnen. Eine der zentralen Lügen ist das Schlagwort "Globalisierung", wobei man vereinfacht meint, da? L?hne in Deutschland mit denen in Fernost, Afrika oder sonst einem Billiglohnland vergleichbar sein müssen. Diese Strategien sind nicht wirklich neu. Mit Beginn der Industrialisierung (19.Jahrhundert) waren viele Unternehmer der Meinung, da? sie ihre Mitarbeiter nur auspressen müssen, damit richtig "Kasse" gemacht werden kann. Aber die Menschen haben gelernt, da? "nichts" mitunter besser ist, als allzeit zu wenig. Sie haben sich organisiert und in vielen Arbeitsk?mpfen und unter erheblichen Entbehrungen ein vernünftiges Klima geschaffen. Ohne Sozialneid!!! Dieses Land hat es nach dem 2.Weltkrieg nur zu etwas gebracht, weil ma?volles Handeln auf Arbeitgeber- und Arbeitnehmerseite einen derartigen Aufschwung ohne lange Arbeitsk?mpfe erm?glichte. Teile der  Enkelgeneration  der damaligen Wirtschaftselite haben jede Hemmung verloren und versuchen die Ausbeutung der Menschen zum Zwecke der Gewinnmaximierung voranzutreiben. Das kann nicht gut gehen und wird im Chaos enden. Die davon betroffenen Menschen brauchen keine Rolex, keine Luxusautos, keine privaten Schwimmb?der und keine H?user. Sie brauchen ein Einkommen mit normaler Arbeit, das ihr Leben und das ihrer Familie absichert.

Telekinese ist eine der schwierigsten und riskantesten Dinge die du überhaupt tun kannst, und ich werde auch nicht weiter drauf eingehen..<br>  aber die Empathie und telepathische Bindung kann ganz nützlich für Menschen sein.. es ist eine Form der Kommunikation die viel schneller geht als mit Worten, Abl?ufe synchronisieren kann, und zudem sehr diskret ist.. es kann in vielen F?llen Autosuggestion sein, muss es aber nicht.. Mental starke Menschen k?nnen anderen Menschen sehr gut 'Nachrichten in Form von Gedanken' senden, sind aber dafür weniger in der Lage solche zu empfangen.. bei ihnen kommt nur noch die substile Nachricht an, die sie zwar recovern k?nnen aber nicht in voller Reinheit lesen k?nnen..

Tu sei fatta cosi e se agli altri non piaci per questo motivo significa che non ti meritano. E' veramente stupido quando qualcuno ti critica su qualcosa che a lui non piace, e come se lui ti vorrebbe diversa e non ti accetta come sei. Secondo me è meglio una persona timida un pò riservata però buona ed intelligente che una persona che parla troppo, socievole che però è stupida e ignorante.|`|5816e9a3b8c59abaa0b95cab1526e060aa	E' possibile.

Timidi non si nasce, ci si diventa in famiglia, quando ti fanno capire che il tuo parere non conta, le tue idee non sono brillanti o sono sbagliate. Per sapere tanto devi essere un genietto eppure non ne hai consapevolezza, come hanno fatto a renderti così insicura? Vai indietro nella tua storia, oppure fatti aiutare, è triste passare la vita senza valorizzarsi, perchè la gente lo sente e se ne approfitta.

Dall'altra (scusa, non vuiole essere un'offesa), il fatto che tu conosca 6 lingue etc.. non significa molto.<br>  E' vero che in linea di massima intelligenza e cultura vanno a braccetto, ma non sempre è così. Ho frequentato persone di tutti i tipi e per abbreviare ti faccio gli esempi delle prime due amiche che mi sono venute alla mente.<br>  Una è laureata in lingue, insegna e non so come abbia fatto ad arrivare alla laurea, in quanto quando parla in italiano tira fuori delle atrocità che non hai idea, ma il punto non è nemmeno questo. E' una bugiarda, dice bugie persino quando non sono necessarie, qualunque fatto ti racconti, non sai quale sia la percentuale di fesserie inclusa. Inoltre è una persona senza carattere, anche sulle piccole cose. Ad esempio se frequenta Tizia e ha stima di questa, cambia quasi tutte le sue opinioni. Mi spiego: mentre impazzisce per Ramazzotti, se Tizia le dice che lo detesta, il giorno dopo anche lei ne parlerà male. Ed è così per tutte le sue opinioni.<br>  Inoltre non è capace di grandi gesti di generosità.<br>  La mia seconda amica invece, per problemi economici familiari, non ha potuto studiare, non ha terminato le medie, ma oltre al fatto che butta fuori meno "vongole" dell'altra quando parla, è una persona sincera, piena di carattere, altruista e via dicendo...<br>  Conclusione? E' tutto il modo di essere o di proporsi di una persona che la fa stimare più o meno dagli altri. Analizzati bene e chiediti se davvero nel tuo caso sia solo un fatto di timidezza e se così fosse, allora allontana tutti i veri idioti che ti circondano.|`|b536c8e14ed51cfe62ac9ab8ee215f46aa	Fregatene !!!

Purtroppo devi comprendere che la gente manca spesso di sensibilità e di capacità di chiara percezione della persona che ha di fronte.

Credo che il problema invece sia proprio questo. Bisogna imparare a lasciare l'università  dietro le porte dlla facoltà. quando esci alla gente non interessa se sai ordinare una pizza in giapponese.<br>  Fuori dall'università e dagli orari di studio devi dare importanza ad altro e non solo a quanto sei brava.<br>  Saper parlare 6 lingue è dimostarzione di una mente aperta ed elaztica quindi ti suggerisco di di usare questa tua capacità straordianria nei rapporti interperonali. <br>  Psicologia a parte, chiunqu preferirebbe la compagia di un ignorante chiaccherone piuttosto di un secchione taciturno. <br>  Cosa vuol dire so parlare sei lingue, ho dato 15 esami e ho fatto lo scientifico?!?!?!?Secondto te queste sono le giuste premesse e requisiti per essere persone simpatiche e socievoli?!?

QFqPY7Twaa	I have exactly the same! And not only that, but any visit, call or activity before 4pm seems traumatasing my day!! I tryed everything, from making schedules to waking up at 8 and hanging around like a ghost...for, probably the rest of the day. I am trying now something new that is working, and for a couple of months now (I feel so proud) and maybe you want to try? You need pen and paper...<br>  <br>  1. Make a list of things you HAVE to do daily, and do it in detail. I tell you, better be realistic, so not unrealistic planings about changing your life, just what we all have to do. (ex., 1)making the dishes, 2)water your plants, 3)give food to your cat, 4)cleaning the tables, 5)opening the windows, 6)making the bed, 7)have a shower, 8)get dressed, 9)empty ashtrays....) Whatever thing it comes together with the thinking of "perhaps later..." and are boring, added to this list, and how smaller-more detailed is, the better. Don't worry if now you have too many things. If you have more than 15, make 2 lists! <br>  <br>  2. For me, the most difficult thing was to start with the plan. 3rd day was already easy! So I recomend you...start the day after tomorrow. Why not tomorrow?<br>  <br>  3. Because tomorrow you go shopping and buy all things they will make your life easyer on daily rutins. Wonder anti-spot sponges, cleaning liquid for glass with special mop, etc,etc... I had found that the expensive products work, in most of the cases, TRULY BETTER, so you work less with better result. Known brands it's also recomendible.<br>  <br>  4. Now, what is the trick? I really don't know if this will work for you...so, I try, ok? You never know, maybe, after all, you don't find it that silly... I wake up, whenever that is, and I take my time. I start the day with coffe (in your case, orange juice...?)and I do something I like that it takes no more than 2 hours. Well, is a good begin, isn't it? 2 hour of freedom. Whatever that is for you. But be sure that activity does not take more than 2 hours. Then I still give myself a little regard...a little chocolate, reading a magazine, something short. Now, I hate rutin and schedules, so to avoid doing everyday the same, at the same time or in the same order...Take the list. Look at the date. Today is 9, so you start doing nr. 9.and nr.10. Are you done? GREAT, so now you can recompensate yourself with 1 hour of freedom. From now on, every break is 1 hour, so enjoy! Remember after your break, stil 5 or 10 min. of selfindulgence. Now comes the list, nr. 11 and 12. If this works, you (and me) should be proud! Break. Little break. And now...<br>  <br>  5. Now comes something a bit more taugh. You are perhaps thinking, what about the things you don't do daily? Throwing those old newspapers, writting the bills, all that big cleaning, the garage is chaos, etc,etc... Well, everyday, you are going to do 1 thing, and if you are lucky, maybe even not at all. Go to 1 room (everyday a different room) adn take a die and trow it. 1-2? Flors. Bacum cleaner, papers, cd's...The flor of that room, today, it will have to be clean. 3-4? Surfaces. Dust on cupboards, that old vase of flowers, lamps, papers (again...), those marcs of old cups... 5-6? Simply put order. Visual order. Magazines, decorations, make a pile of papers (didn't I said that already?), remote controls, shoes around, etc. The good thing of this method is that you never know what you have to do, so there may be a chance that once you get a 5-6 for your corridor and is very little to do...or other times you get stuck with that kitchen.<br>  <br>  Uff....I think that is it. The rest of the day continues normaly untill you finish your list. If you can't finish the list in a day, that means you need more lists, so you divide your work. Don't worry if you don't finish the list 1 day or 2...but reschedule when is need it. Like this, maybe you will finally not feel guilty when you find yourself on the sofa watching tv after work, so you deserve it!  Ah, I almost forgot. Saturday is free. Hope you give it a try... Good luck!<br>  <br>  P.D: Usually I check my spelling before submiting, so I am Spanish, but the sistem doesn't want to work. Sorry for the mistakes...|`|Ces5k5R7aa	Your personality type might be that of a "last minute" mentality (as opposed to a "planning ahead") mentality.  The best part about this is that studies have shown that both types will get the same grades on papers and projects (e.g. the planner who finished their paper early vs the other guy/gal who checked out the books to start doing his/her research at 10pm when it was due the next day at 8am).<br>  <br>  This helped me a lot when I learned this statistic because I could relax more when I was procrastinating instead of procrastinating AND beating myself up inside about it.|`|4eef856894e5589602fce86e2a516837aa	I am not sure about your case, but I would like to share with you. We were working on some programmes implementation accross the region last year. We worked like robots, days and nites, running to and fro airports to catch our flights. No sunshine, but only morning dews that we had for almost two straight years. We were dead pale, very grouchy group of people on this planet---this is how I felt. If nothing works, we will cry our hearts out. Man, we cried...lots of it ....yes we do!. <br>  <br>  But I was lucky, in a way I was team up with my buddy who was a nite person. He is very productive in the evening, as for me I am a morning person. So we kind of team up miraculously well with each other, he would tease me in the day time, and I would tease him all nite. We irritate each other, to get the work done. And we completed the tasks on time and on budget! Funny he puts on more weight, I lost much of mine.....(work hazard). Now we are back to our normal decent self, enjoying life. Man...looking back I can really smile now.<br>  <br>  So, what I am trying to tell you is that you could be a nite person. Your motivation level is at its best during the nite. Hope this helps to ease some pains.|`|3bdc186812f5de706a35be78e8f4f9d2aa	dont u think .. you yourself got answers? <br>  u just need self-motivation and u need to make efforts to it...<br>  when u know u procrastinate then y do u procrastinate? u dont feel like doing things? forget what your heart says... forget what u dont feel like doing...<br>  tell yourself... "i have to do it... so lets get to work!"  shout at yourself... feel the energy!!!  you can do it... why d u worry?<br>  <br>  just get up and do it!<br>  <br>  good luck...|`|AA11758464	I had the same problem, but everything changed when I started doing yoga. It creates a balance between your physical and mental dimensions. Get up around 6 in the morning and do yoga for atleast 10 minutes and then, increase your duration gradually. You'll see the difference.<br>  Once, you are mentally calmed, your brain will function efficiently and you'll get the answer to your question yourself.

rqnSkfMgaa	L'adolescence est par définition une période trouble. Donc, des comportements ou émotions que l'on qualifierait de symptomatiques pour un adulte ne le sont pas pour un adolescent; ils finissent par s'émousser et les choses reprennent leur cours normal.<br>  <br>  Néanmoins, il ne faut pas oublier que c'est un moment propice à l'éclosion d'une grave maladie mentale, la schizophrénie. Alors, certaines manifestations sont absolument à prendre au sérieux. Au début, les signes ne sont pas organisés et peuvent prendre l'apparence d'une dépression avec perte de plaisir, asthénie somatique et psychique, désinvestissement des amis et des activités (sportives, scolaires, culturelles, familiales...), des difficultés d'attention, de concentration, de mémorisation, une inquiétude exacerbée sur le corps (pas du genre "je me sens moche, les filles/les gar?ons ne me regardent pas" mais plut?t du style "mon visage n'arrête pas de changer", "mes yeux donnent accès directement à mon monde intérieur, donc je ne regarde personne pour ne pas me dévoiler", "je ne sens plus mes bras/jambes/pieds, etc"). Le fait de développer des hallucinations visuelles ou audives (en dehors de l'emprise d'une drogue), une agressivité incontr?lée; de s'enfermer dans le mutisme et/ou l'apragmatisme sont également inquiétants. Pour remarquer un trouble, il suffit de bien observer les éventuels changements dans le comportement et de ne pas sous-estimer la parole de l'adolescent. Il faut être particulièrement à l'écoute.<br>  <br>  Poser un diagnostic, même en présence de multiples signes, n'est jamais tache aisée: les troubles peuvent aussi bien rester limités dans le cadre d'une unique bouffée délirante sans conséquence et relativement facile à traiter que évoluer vers une pathologie organisée comme la schizophrénie ou un trouble bi-polaire maniaco-dépressif.<br>  <br>  Si vous vous posez des questions sur un adolescent de votre entourage, le mieux serait de prendre contact avec ses professeurs ou le psychologue scolaire pour leur faire part de vos inquiétudes et savoir si eux aussi ont remarqué quelque chose. Il existe par ailleurs des centres spécialisés sur l'enfance et l'adolescence (les services de psychiatrie des h?pitaux généraux ou les centres médico-psycho-pédagogiques) où vous pourrez trouver des professionnels qui vous éclaireront.|`|2dVtrRg4aa	Le comportement de l'enfant dévoile tous les troubles, et il suffit de rencontrer un thérapeute pour savoir de quel trouble il s'agit.|`|qlaQGPqmaa	Il sont nombreux.. les deux plus "costauds" sont cependant le syndrome maniaco-dépressif et le trouble "Borderline"  tu trouveras une documenattion ultra complete sur le trouble borderline sur :<br>  <br>  www.aapel.org<br>  <br>  Quant au trouble bipolaire (synonyme de maniaco-dépression) voilà un excellent lien :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://users.skynet.be/sisyphe/maniaco.asp" rel="nofollow">http://users.skynet.be/sisyphe/maniaco.a...</a>|`|J7g30DzRaa	c'est la période ou beaucopup de questions exisensielles se posent d'ou la crise d'adolescent mais c'est aussi la période de transition de l'enfant à l'adulte on est ni l'un ni l'autre mais on est sur le chemin de devenir adulte

a0a63ce4b5bb40ebe37efbd4442d618eaa	I think the reason a teacher is touchy-feely probably differs for each teacher. I have had a professor who touched all the students because it was how she showed concern, she would pat us on the back when we did a good job or give us a hug when we needed to be comforted. At the same time I have a teacher that always would hug the students and the reason why is because she felt ignored by her spouse.

Wb6yzXA0aa	Perhaps a good way to deal with this is to be assertive, and ask for what you need:  a clear answer.  <br>  <br>  Try something like, "I'm trying to make sure I understand you, what I think I heard you say was......(restate what your heard).........., am I correct?"<br>  <br>  If they won't clarify their answer, they probably mean no, and are having difficulty saying it.|`|PGPXnSnJaa	I have found that it is best to take a yes or a no at face value rather than try to interpet your perception of anothers true meaning.

V4L3ewOqaa	<<notizie su telepatia?>> <br>  io prendo teleregione e telesuono ma nn telepatia, e poi nn vojo pagare un secondo canone TV....|`|866a46e62ddf9c26732be873ef09e2f0aa	Pensare fortemente a qualcuno mette in funzione solo l'ansia. Il fenomeno della telepatia, cui gli increduli non danno peso per paura che gli si sconvolgano gli schemi, esiste ma non può mai essere avocato a piacimento. Esiste soprattutto fra i gemelli, sia monozigoti che dizigoti, a volte tra persone che si amano, e a volte del tutto casualmente. Una volta il mio ragazzo disse: - Ho sognato un mio amico che vive in Calabria, anche se non lo vedo da cinque anni sicuramente lo vedrò fra breve perchè quando sogno persone lontane le incontro sempre. - Mi sembrava assurdo ma entro pochi giorni questa persona si presentò e non aveva fra l'altro legami particolari col mio ragazzo. Potrei citare vari casi, come quello di un'amica che doveva comunicare urgentemente con la figlia che era ingiro a bighellonare per il mondo senza avere idea di dove fosse. La sera stessa la figlia la chiamò telefonicamente dichiarando che si era sentita chiamare dalla sua voce. Non voglio dilungarmi ma la telepatia esiste solo che non è quantificabile. Per saperne di più Carl Gustav Jung ne scrisse un saggio con sperimentazioni e casistiche, insomma non era un visionario.|`|36641be4eff287bebedd95e7b04fefb9aa	La telepatìa, detta anche trasmissione del pensiero, è la ipotetica capacità di comunicare con la mente, cioè senza l'utilizzo di altri sensi o strumenti. Il termine "telepatia" venne introdotto nel 1882 da F.W.H. Myers e deriva dal greco τηλε, tèle (lontano) e π?θεια, pàtheia (sentimento). Come la precognizione e la chiaroveggenza, la telepatia fa parte delle cosiddette percezioni extrasensoriali o ESP e più in generale, di quello delle presunte "facoltà paranormali". Rientra nel campo di indagine della parapsicologia<br>   primi studi su questa presunta facoltà paranormale furono condotti dalla Società per la Ricerca Psichica di Londra, verso la fine dell'Ottocento.<br>  Il primo laboratorio di parapsicologia fu costituito negli anni 1930 negli Stati Uniti d'America, quando il professor Joseph Rhine della Duke University di Durham (Carolina del Nord) condusse numerosi esperimenti, con l'ausilio ad esempio delle carte Zener, per accertare l'effettiva realtà della telepatia. Tuttavia i lavori di Rhine presentavano diversi errori metodologici e furono in seguito ampiamente criticati.<br>  Negli anni 1970 un altro parapsicologo americano, Charles Honorton, si interessò di telepatia introducendo una nuova metodologia di studi, chiamata tecnicamente Ganzfeld (dal tedesco "campo uniforme"). Negli esperimenti di Honorton un soggetto ("percipiente") veniva isolato sensorialmente applicando ai suoi occhi due mezze palline da ping-pong e alle sue orecchie una cuffia che emetteva un "rumore di fondo". In queste condizioni di deprivazione sensoriale, il soggetto doveva cercare di recepire immagini o informazioni inviate da un'altra persona ("agente") posta in un'altra stanza. Anche Honorton pensava di aver trovato risultati statisticamente positivi a favore dell'esistenza della telepatia. Tuttavia, come venne dimostrato dallo psicologo Ray Hyman, anche in questo caso erano stati commessi numerosi errori metodologici.<br>  Al momento non esistono dimostrazioni scientifiche dell'esistenza di tale capacità. La nota associazione scettica James Randi Educational Foundation ha messo un premio di un milione di dollari per chiunque sia in grado di dimostrare un fenomeno di telepatia (o altra facoltà paranormale) in condizioni di adeguato controllo sperimentale.<br>  In Italia, il CICAP (Comitato Italiano per il Controllo delle Affermazioni sul Paranormale) si offre di analizzare ogni persona che sia disposta a provare la propria abilità telepatica. Il test preliminare da superare è il seguente: al soggetto trasmittente saranno mostrate quattro immagini a colori, ed egli dovrà trasmetterne una, scelta a sorte, al soggetto ricevente, col quale non potrà, ovviamente, comunicare durante la prova. Il ricevente avrà davanti a sé quattro immagini identiche a quelle del trasmittente, e dovrà indicare quale è l'immagine che gli è stata trasmessa. Per dimostrare una qualche dote telepatica, la prova dovrà avere successo almeno 15 volte su 20.<br>  Nessuno finora ha superato, in Italia e nel mondo, questi test preliminari.|`|29e0eee514ce58e676207386fe5d2f23aa	nn so se crederci...a volte mi capita di pensare ad una cosa o una persona e subito dopo trovarmi realizzato lo stesso pensiero (che magari ti sembra impossibile che possa accadere in quel momento) o di incontrare quella persona..ma nn credo che pensare fortemente a qualcuno scateni la telepatia..ciao|`|7d650a93ce397ab09b97bad984f05af1aa	Non lo so,ma a me è capitata spesso una cosa simile con una persona,riusciva a sapere cosa pensassi oppure cosa volessi! però nn so se sia telapia o meno,magari possono essere coincidenze!|`|b536c8e14ed51cfe62ac9ab8ee215f46aa	Sono tutte sciocchezze.

E' vero che è solo una fantasia ed un pensiero, ma è vero anche che si tramuta in qualcosa di reale considerato il fatto che hai un'orgasmo ed una trasporto poco indifferente verso questo delirio!<br>  Ma è una fantasia assurda che ha dei fondamenti ( in quanto hai un 'orgasmo ) ma è totalmente aliena, in quanto tu mai e poi mai potresti assistere al tuo funerale, visto che saresti  morta!<br>  Quindi qui subentra il problema... il tuo è fantasticare su qualcosa che mai potrà realizzarsi di conseguenza ti ecciti per qualcosa di totalmente impossibile! <br>  Concludo consigliandoti ( lasciando ovviamente un ampio margine di diffidenza sul fatto che tu sia una donna e che il tuo problema sia davvero quello descritto ), di consultare uno psicologo, che ti faccia per lo meno capire la differenza tra un orgasmo e un funerale!<br>  Spero di essere stato chiaro, ed in ogni caso, per il primo problema eviterei di parlarne con il tuo ragazzo attuale, anche perchè lo forzeresti a fare qualcosa a cui lui non è assolutamente portato..perchè se così fosse te ne saresti gia accorta!<br>  Un' ultima cosa.., anche io potrei domandare su answer perchè quando vedo la me rda mi viene l' acquolina in bocca ed ho voglia di mangiarmela.. e stai sicura che qualcuno mi augurerebbe buon appetito, oppure mi direbbe che se sono contento io sono contenti tutti, oppure mi direbbe addirittura che posso fare ciò che voglio visto che non faccio male a nessuno!<br>  Il mio ovviamente è solo un esempio paradossale, ma ti garantisco che c'è sempre qualcuno che trova tutto normale, anche quando le cose normali non sono!
si71Qg0Gaa	I will start by saying that what you are aiming at is not an easy feat. You want to balance the equation. As i analyze your question, you want to solve two problems:<br>  <br>  1.) How to make yourself more adamant against these <br>   people?<br>  <br>  2.) How to make yourself look more strong-willed?<br>  <br>  To both, i give you one answer: PRETEND.<br>  So, what makes this a good answer? <br>  <br>  1.) When you envision a strong persona and pretend to yourself that you have that trait, EVENTUALLY you will inbibe that trait.<br>  <br>  2.) I used to have the same problems and through this method, i became stronger and now I'm the predator and no longer the prey.<br>  <br>  So, how will you do this?<br>  <br>  Its simple, just follow this steps:<br>  <br>  1.) Envision what you want to be.<br>  2.) Ask yourself why you have to (or want to) change yourself.<br>  3.) Establish the fact that you are doing this for YOURSELF and not for others as the benefits of this strategy will not linger if you think or establish otherwise.<br>  4.) Establish to yourself that you are a person that needs to be respected. You are a person who CAN make things happen. These people are underestimating you and you prove them wrong.<br>  5.) Envision how these people often deal with you and draw a mental script that will detail your plan of action whenever they begin to push you again against the wall.<br>  6.) Practice this mental script.<br>  7.) When you think you are ready then start to play the part of the strong individual that you want to be.<br>  <br>  I believe that by this, you will be stronger. This is what i did and it worked for me. Practice this little by little and if you are able to blend this strategy with the culture of the place and the culture of the people that you work with you will be successful. Assuming on the point that since it worked for me, it might work for you.|`|C4hfEjidaa	Just go with the flow............................|`|CnY90BPBaa	Why are they reacting like that?

kolDDBL3aa	I just read that story. That is crazy. It would have to be really overwhelming at first. And maybe alittle sad because you missed out on so much.

They split up and he took off. He went out, got drunk picked up a girl in town and was in a very serious accident. He spent over 10 years in a coma and we were all told he would never come out of it. To the amazment of all of his doctors one day he awoke and announced to the world he was back by pinching his nurse on the butt! I know from watching Bobby that it is something I would never want to go through. He was still stuck back when Linda was the love of his life and I was a toddler, he had to come to grips with a lot of things when he woke up....Linda was married, had a family and I too was all grown up. I am not sure I would be so accepting if my world were to have gone on around me and I woke one day to what would be like a very bad dream.|`|uEVJuoKyaa	Good question, I just read that article, myself. Although it would be a little overwhelming at first, it would be a happier adoptation. <br>  In the case of this man, the communism is gone, and he is in a free country. If he went into coma today in our country, and woke up in a third world country in a complete chaos like Darfur, that would be difficult to the point of driving him into depression. However it is always easier to adjust to a better life style, than it is to a downgraded one.<br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question.|`|RimtnXqRaa	I would probably freak out, because I wouldn't know I was in a coma, and expect the world to be as I had just gotten up from a nap or something.

595408954755781de34a7c221a8eca76aa	Intuition or that gut feeling is the very thing you should listen too. It can save your life. Many people do not listen to it and often find themselves making the wrong decision that can impact their lives for good. So yes, if you believe that someone is not telling the truth, maybe they are not. However, you also need to be cautious, because sometimes our feelings can tell us what we think we want to know. That is when you need to think things through. For example, Sue has a hard time trusting and she is in a relationship with John. She finds John on the phone and he is speaking quietly. Her feelings tell her- he is cheating. However, is that actually true? It may have something to do with the fact that she doesn't trust easily. So be careful to no jump to conclusions.<br>  <br>  However if you're gut is waving a BIG RED FLAG. Then I would listen to it.|`|AA11545048	Hi there . Look i am really glad you asked this because to be honest with you i don't believe there is a right or wrong answer for this but i had to answer based on strong intuitive belief!!!! I I am 35 years of age and have just realized over the last couple of years that it doesn't matter how much i have had that little voice on my shoulder in life prove over and over that, that voice being intuition i believe is always 100% right . The thing i really hate is that for its 100% accuracy i still in different times go with that other voice... The one in the top of my head that i know has an excellent chance of being wrong. Its like your dealing with 2 different people whereby the less intelligent rules the superior.  crazy!!! . i beleive the only way is compramise by being aware that first voice is always right and asking the second voice for consideration before allowing it to decide. I hope i have been of some help.|`|9xUX9saFaa	I'm sorry but your grammar is really really quite bad. It's actually hard to understand.<br>  <br>  As for the answer- trust yourself.

Studi molto interessanti sono stati effettuati dalla scuola di Palo Alto, che ha edito diverse pubblicazioni. Gli autori, tra le varie disfuzioni comunicative individuano la circolarità. Banalmente, posso dire che si ha circolarità comunicativa quando uno crede che il proprio comportamento sia causato da quello dell'altro, e vice versa (es. una moglie diventa invadente perché dice che il marito non le parla, e il marito sostiene che diventa schivo perché la moglie è troppo invadente). Questa dinamica si riscontra quasi sempre in contesti famigliari in cui vi sia un sogetto affetto soprattutto da sindromi depressive. E uscire da un circolo, lo saprai anche tu, è veramente difficoltoso. Ciò non significa che sia la comunicazione circolare a creare patologie mentali, ma che vi contribuisce in modo forte.<br>  Ora, perdona l'invadenza, credo che la teatralità di tu padre, e gli altri episodi di repentno cambio di umore, possano essere collegati al timore o all'indifferenza che provocano i suoi comportamenti negli altri, quando il suo desiderio è quello di essere accolto (infatti ti viene a cercare). Immagino che i suoi slanci di affettività ti irritino, e ti facciano pensare che lui ti ritiene un babino. Al contrario, prova ad entrare nell'ottica che sia lui il bambino (tu stesso lo defiisci pulcino), prova a cercare un qualche contatto (MINIMO) con lui, a dargli conferma con uno sguardo o sfiorargli la mano. Certo, non è la soluzione, ma potrebbe essere un inizio.<br>  Ovviamente ti consiglio di rivolgerti ad un esperto (il meglio sarebe uno psicologo gestaltico), nel frattempo ti indico qualche lettura di quanto ti ho esposto sopra, nel caso ti possa interessare.

He's trying to get you to contact him, by not explaining himself properly or by hanging up before finishing the conversation. He's trying to make you get back in contact with him so he can  turn around and say your trying to get back with him to make himself feel better that he hasn't actually moved on.

6eed3c6ed1117fe6baa4febd3849d742aa	How can that not affect you?  BUT -- exactly half of us are below average in any given category, including beauty.  We must live with our limitations.<br>  <br>  The schoolmates you are quoting are well below average in tact, tolerance, security, kindness and perhaps vision.<br>  <br>  As to "letting" it affect you...beyond the initial impact...I would use the experience to see if there was anything in my looks I could or even care to improve and be done with it.<br>  <br>  Other than that, to quote my husband, "opinions are like a**holes; everybody has one."<br>  <br>  As far as responding to those schoolmates, it depends upon a lot of details you have not gone into.  Just schoolmates, as opposed to friends?  Whether or not you take the trouble to respond, you should be thinking "what is your point here?", "do you have something useful to say hiding behind those words?"<br>  <br>  Obviously there are people out there who do not think of you as "ugly". Even more valuable, there are people who might, if asked, notice that you are no great shakes in the outward beauty department, but it will continue to matter NOT A WHIT to them.  <br>  <br>  Think of it this way:  all through life, unbeknownst to us, people are noticing and saying things about us that may or may not be valid.  You and I do it, too.<br>  <br>  The real question is "whose opinions matter to me?"  That should be a very short list and include yourself in the starring role :-)|`|PYIA2FCFaa	yes. thats hurtful.<br>  <br>  next time if you are the one being called ugly, you should say "well, thats not what your dad was saying last night!" ooohhhhh. :)|`|AA10972821	Why should you care what they think?  I'm not saying it wouldn't affect me, but I wouldn't let it upset me to the point where I couldn't function.  To be honest, college is still a lot like high school where people gossip about others and hurt their feelings on purpose....They are supposed to be adults and act more mature but in reality they don't.  So, because of this, I wouldn't let anything they say affect my own goals in life. Eventually, most of them WILL grow up and become adults, but it might take a while!|`|c96a826a1b2655ff81b951010262f941aa	Of course not... but you should shut them off... I mean of course it will affect you, even if you try not..... so make them stop do not let them go too far.... stand up on them... no one is allowed to talk to you this way.... you breathing right... so you have the same right that they have: TO BE RESPECTED....<br>  <br>  I hate those people....|`|NlWi9HHkaa	NO because I am smart, neat, always smiling and not talking bad about other people.<br>  YES when I am nasty, dirty and angry.  Better change my behaviour and clean up!|`|cb94bcc3b64976e7d9c5a3c1e7b51af1aa	It would affect me! Few people can withstand that kind of criticism without being affected. But I would not keep friends like that. Real friends accept you for WHO you are, not what you look like!|`|YvWSqALtaa	I personally would have to answer this question as a no. Simply because being called ugly is very subjective. It's like the old saying beauty is in the eye of the beholder.<br>  <br>  To be beautiful in certain tribes you have to elongate your neck using rings, some of them would rather have you elongate your ear lobes. In our society we would call them ugly and their practice disgusting. However they must think the same thing when they look at the nature of our society and how we look, considering we augment parts of our body as well (see plastic surgery).<br>  <br>  If someone calls you ugly they only do so because they want a reaction out of you, if you don't react to it then they have failed in their "mission". If you react to them then you have handed them victory.|`|5DfPFUjlaa	yes
3urQfMffaa	You're just a "morning person" lol.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	This is one of the reasons I get depressed in the winter, no birds, no sun, no little bugs going, "Yahoo!

I have the opposite problem.  I hate mornings.  My brain does not switch on until 10 or 11 a.m. once I am at work.  Until then I mindlessly go though a routine to go to the gym or to work depending on the day.<br>  <br>  Be glad you are a morning person.|`|6a221e63714f9d33724ccb40cd162c0aaa	Because it's beautiful outside! I sometimes feel that too, but then I wake up at 6:00 to go to school, so the feeling vanishes quickly, especially in the winter...|`|0fviV0lNaa	nothing bad has happened yet|`|To3MFAOkaa	no, i think its cos u realize that ur still alive and ur glad, cos wen ur in ur grave u wont hear birds chirping and c the sunlight|`|JAKgI4hRaa	You are a nature lover.

uXqDYPNVaa	True, partly. Keep in mind that much of this is the responsibility of judges, who do this because they think women need those extra concessions. Ask ten feminists on the street what they make of it and at least nine will say it's ridiculous.|`|DwLCTjTFaa	False.<br>  <br>  Female-preferred child custody disparity has existed in the American court system since 1813. Before this the custody option was always given to the father first and if he didn't want the child, the mother got custody.  After this case (Pennsylvania v. Addicks) the system's pendulem swung the other way giving custody primarily to the mother.  During the 1970's (At feminism's rise btw *ahem*) the court system switched to a more equal footing by using joint custody rather than sole custody to include the father and even gave custody to more fathers since the 1813 switch.<br>  <br>  But yea, you're right, it had to be those fire breating feminists that made everything SO unequal, uh huh, that is if we forget about history.|`|b0dee10a6de166bc265de45ecc7668e0aa	False.  Lots of ranting there but not any real proof.   Whats thsi paternity fraud thing-  DNA rules out any claim of misrepresentation.|`|WKyPDbglaa	Feminist haven't reached there goals yet. There end goal is either complete female supremacy or gendercide.|`|P1VXjLPOaa	True. I have often described feminism as misguided benevolence. |`|01e421aadcafbfe3ba9371bb7556f4a3aa	YES! i so agree!!! its about time someone said that!|`|8NvX46RNaa	There are still men who want a woman that they can cater to, be polite to, and set upon a pedestal, to show off to friends, and say This is my lady.When the women's rights  movement gained power, we men were expected to treat them as equals, but they never accepted the fact that they had the upper hand before all the hoopla.So they got equality. Now on the basis of equal pay for equal work, or property ownership, business opportunities,all the things that were predominately for men,I believe that they needed those rights, but to put men in skirts and expect us to be girley boys I strongly protest.your statement is true. |`|TxPGaSvQaa	i do believe it overreached its goals.<br>  it had some good points in the beginning, but we, as women, lost some things in the process. such as, men treating us as equals to the point that many men have little respect for women anymore as feminine beings vs. sexual objects. (the billion dollar porn industry is proof of that)<br>  chivalry is mostly dead and the men who are kind enough to still be that way are usually met by suspicious women. "what does he want? im not helpless."<br>  and lastly, men are made fun of now in the media and in society as well. for being insensitive, arrogant, etc...most good intentioned men are not pricks, they are just men. we are wired different and die-hard feminists refuse to accept the differences and see men as "wrong".|`|p7Z4CU9qaa	True.  Feminism has far surpassed it's original intent of assuring equality on behalf of women leading to the infringement of men's  rights.|`|VLDlFGnTaa	very accurate analysis. Just like virtually any liberal idea that might have had good, virtuous roots, people just didn't know when to stop.|`|5oBYGB5Vaa	Unfortunately true. I noticed this in divorce court, where child custody was involved. ~:(>|`|aMCWCeGbaa	Put me down for TRUE.|`|9ab7c5b30122db984710185845f90cbfaa	This is true with all forms of discrimination.  The same thing applies to racial as well as sexual discrimination. I think tha afro-american college fund is a great thing but Miss black america.... racist. What would happen if someone started Miss White america? <br>    Women will get custody of a child unless the father can prove she is unfit. He will pay her thousands in child support and she can be unemployed. The problem is people are afraid to stand up and say something is wrong and be named a racist or discriminator. Chances are i will be called a racist for my comments here but i am not and i am proud to say i am not but i am also brave enough to say ANY form of discrimination is wrong even if you are trying to push for your rights. The word equal doesnt mean give me more because i had less before.|`|rXunLRbuaa	True.  Just like many things that start off with very good intentions, feminism has been corrupted in order to advance a far different goal than it initially had, i.e. rather than equality, Modern Feminism espouses misanthropy.  The most clever part of this Modern Feminism movement is in just how insidiuous it is.  The work of Dr. A. Einstein was never intended to cause harm to human beings, but once his contributions to humanity were discovered by evil people, they realised how easily fissionable technology can be applied to development of nuclear weapons.  Thus, the era of Nuclear munitions was born.  Dr. A. Einstein was devastated by this and, to paraphrase, said that if he had only knew that there are individuals so hateful that they would use his ideas, (i.e. E=mc^2) to use this for the non-selective eradication of countless human lives and the associated sequelae of radiation poisoning, he'd never have had conducted his research nor publish this work.<br>  <br>  It's the same with Feminism.  What was once a righteous goal has been corrupted by a few bad apples and been transformed into a movement of utter hate.|`|V72D4JRTaa	False.  I think the real problem is that social norms in regards to men and women have changed so much that men and women's societal and social roles are constantly being redefined and as a result men don't know how they fit into the modern day woman's world.  They don't know how they would complement the lifestyle of such a woman.  That's why so many relationships go bust...all those insecurity issues going unresolved in many men's heads.|`|jsBHHR53aa	The FACTS are that not one negative claim about men ever made by any feminist anywhere at any time is actually true. This is why no feminist will ever enter a public debate on their claims. Feminists have NEVER been interested in equality. What their psychosis drives them to is to denigrate men in exactly the same way the Nazis did to the Jews or the KKK did to blackfellas.<br>  <br>  Consequently, your intial premise that feminists want equality is false and so the remainder of your question is irrelevant|`|D6JmvTMJaa	True. That's just like paying child support. Some men are ordered to pay child support for a child in which they are not allowed to see. How is that supporting the child? Just another good idea that has gone bad like feminism indeed.<br>  I think that if a mother is awarded child support. The father should get awarded some visitation rights. And receipts on what the money is spent on.|`|Cde7WDv2aa	In the last 20 years it sure has, What feminists can't see or don't want to recognize that Men & Women are different in various aspects,but whether those differences are of degree or truly of kind or both at the same time is one thing people still aren't all sure about as of yet.|`|pZfnhEi7aa	True..<br>  <br>  And feminism was never about equality in the first place, it's about more special perks for women.|`|a92agvc7aa	First of all, has it occured to you that family law, child custody, paternity fraud and domestic violence laws are structures that were not put in place by feminists but by upper class white men?<br>  <br>  Secondly, those laws are gender neutral and do not specifically favour one gender over the other. It is the way they are applied by upper class white men who are lawyers, judges and law-makers that produces the results people are not pleased with.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, in the case of child custody laws for example, when men first enacted these laws women systematically received custody regardless of circumstance. It is feminists who advocated AGAINST that and made it possible for men to gain custody of their children. If that doesn't happen often, blame the upper class white men in power who make those decisions, not feminists who have been fighting against it since the 70s.<br>  <br>  Fourthly, given all this information, the BEEF that people have against feminism is due to a lack of education about where those laws come from, how they affect women just as negatively as men, and about the fact that feminists have been fighting to change those laws for decades. <br>  <br>  Before accusing feminism of overreaching its goal it's important to understand first what those goals are, how they've changed over time and how outside circumstances have affected feminists' ability to pursue these goals when faced with an overwhelming majority of upper class white men in power who benefit from these laws and have no interest in changing them.|`|ba3bf04cd512a9a45dc71e1f7ef484c0aa	True and false.  True today they have crushed innocent men/boys legally in many areas (Western Civ.)  False (according to them) because now they want to help out 3rd world countries where there is still rampant abuse.  My question is, who the f*ck cares about my son? Or your child?  Don't they deserve a chance?  <br>  <br>  Before we go sticking our necks (and Marines) into the picture, maybe we should clean up our acts.  Otherwise we will be viewed by the world as Hitlers intent on "invading" their countries.<br>  <br>  I guess that's what all the left behind boys are for; to die for the feminists.  Imagine all the lawyers who stand to make a buck once unfair laws are introduced into 3rd world nations.  And all the social chaos...what a way to "take over" a country.<br>  <br>  I wonder why the feminists are avoiding this question?<br>  <br>  Edited: Oh my, thumbs down for telling the truth.

I più grandi amori hanno una  forza interiore che emanano e riescono a capire solo dai gesti quello che l'altro vuole. Vi domandate mai,  andando al cinema ci commuoviamo delle volte per un bacio rubato una  canzone che ci ricorda quel tal film e magari il nostro primo innamoramento, il nostro primo bacio, la nostra prima avventura alla ricerca del l'amore, quanti ricordano i sacrifici fatti insieme, quanti ricordano le effusioni anche in mezzo alla strada e tante altre pazzie che si fanno per amore.

awxtVRMgaa	è difficile risponderti se no che ogni uno ha il suo destino scritto.vedi quante volte soffriamo e ci diciamo basta non ne voglio più sapere e dopo t' innamori di nuovo sembra che va tutto bene e quando meno ti aspetti trak arriva la botta e trovi da capo a pensare questa è l' ultima non ne voglio più.d' altronde le persone che soffrono di più sono quelle più sensibile, e poi non è giusto che ti fermi e ti chiudi perché magari è la volta buona..guarda anche io vedo quelli che non trovano mai l' anima gemella e vedo anche quelli che sono da una vita insieme quindi???il destino cara.ti consiglio però di non buttarti fin dal inizio con i sentimenti aspetta..lo so che è difficile però se non ti prendi tu cura di te chi altro lo fa??cerca di volerti più bene a te che a lui..è un pò da egoisti ma fa bene.auguri.|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	credici...forse non c'é un metodo preciso....il tuo cuore fa tutto da sè!!lo so l'amore é una cosa moooolto complicata!|`|z9ATmM32aa	non abbatterti e d'ora in po cerca di camminare con i piedi per terra <br>  non  peroc il tuo turno arriverà basta crederci <br>  tanto adesso vengono le vacanze .... bè allora potresti trovare un ragzzzo che vedi per una sola estate oppure un ragazzo che rivedrai per i prossimi mesi futuri<br>  buona fortuna quest'estate <br>  cio un bacio<br>  credimi le vancanze se capita sono magiche come a me due anni fa e adesso stiamo ancora insieme<br>  <br>  però s enon succederà non ti devi abbattere cmq capitoooooooooooooooooooooooooo|`|Ez5xIueOaa	Capita spesso che le persone in cui credi ti feriscano, anche perchè se non ci tenessi non penso ti farebbe alcun effetto...!<br>  Comunque, innamorarsi purtroppo fa male, soprattutto quando credi nell'amore e nella frase "lui è quello giusto" più di ogni altra cosa e poi...Resti delusa. Purtroppo è csì...Ma, e credimi se ti dico che non è semplicemente un luogo comune, troverai quello giusto, quello che ti farà vivere miliardi di momenti belli...E allora capirai che l'amore non è solo sofferenza, anzi: è soprattutto FELICITA'! In bocca al lupo...<br>  1baci8lo|`|JS5RGexbaa	le faccende che riguardano l'amore nn sono mai faccende facili. non esiste, purtroppo, una regola che possa permetterti di trovare l'amore giusto, quello della tua vita...prima di trovarlo passi sempre attraverso esperienze negative (ma che lasciano anche dei bei ricordi, perchè no?) che ti formano, che ti induriscono o che ti aprono gli occhi su alcuni aspetti e ti permetono di vedere quello che sarà il grande amore!<br>  fortunate le persone che lo trovano subito, ma personalmente non è che ci creda tantissimo....non potranno mai capire veramente se quello è quello giusto.... non mi sono spiegato?<br>  allora... se io da una vita mangio la crema pasticcera e basta, come posso sapere che la cioccolata non mi piaccia più della crema se non l'ho mai assaggiata? e lo stesso ( secondo me) vale anche per quelle persone che dicono di trovare l'amore della loro vita al primo rapporto....<br>  hai ragione nel dire che non sempre sono "rose e fiori" ma le esperienze servono, (anche in virtù dell'esempio scemo che ti ho fatto prima (altrimenti a cosa servirebbe?  :-)   )  e servono, come ti ho già detto ad aprirti gli occhi,a farti capire che cosa cerchi in un uomo.. sicuramente non cerchi uno che approfitta della tua assenza per fare il cretinetto con la tua amica, non credo che la tua aspirazione sia quella, sei troppo preziosa per una persona così squallida e povera di sentimenti.. Evidentemente non è l'uomo che fa per te! Abbi pazienza, non chiudere il tuo cuore, tieni sempre le porte del cuore aperte e aspetta, vedrai che arriverà quello giusto.avrai sicuramente altre "amicizie" alcune ti faranno stare sulle spine, ma vedrai che qundo arriverà quello giusto lo capirai perchè ti toglierà tutti i dibbi che hai, non avrai paura di soffrire e l'unica cosa che vorrai sarà quella di "crogiolarti" nell'amore che ricevi e un'innata voglia di amare.<br>  buona fortuna, ciao ciao.
2KC467tFaa	I was in a terrible accident about 2 1/2 years ago. I was hit by a drunk driver who died. I walked away. I'm still afraid of driving, but my therapist told me that the first step in overcoming that is to pay attention to every little thing you do each day to protect yourself. She's trying to get me to have trust in myself and my decisions. Once my trust builds, I'm sure I'll have more trust in the people around me. I'll let you know.|`|FQxbwbtlaa	u can over com it

Bene, dopo un viaggio in auto di circa un'ora mi sono trovato di fronte all'ambasciata (non ti dico il nome solo per rispetto di queste persone), scendo dall'auto e dopo pochi metri vedo arrivare quel ragazzo che avevo medicato, certo è stato una cosa molto bella e mi è venuto in mente una cosa, che è il destino delle volte a farti incontrare le persone giuste al momento giusto, dopo vari convenevoli e presentazioni varie finalmente conosco i suoi familiari che con tanti ringraziamenti mi invitano a sedermi  a tavola con loro, ho chiesto se potevo fare una telefonata a mia moglie, il che ha mandato in bestia il padre, ha chiamato i due autisti e credo che gli abbia detto corri a prendere anche la moglie, perchè abbiamo atteso più di un'ora e ho visto mia moglie sulla porta della sala da pranzo e il console scusarsi con lei per non averla presa insieme a me. Ora sono passati più di 30 anni e per me è un ricordo che difficilmente scorderò, perchè è il mio mestiere non chiedere, ma fare e basta. Poi quello che è successo nei giorni sequenti è cosa da non credere anche per me che lò vissuta personalmente, era un andirivieni di persone che mi ringraziavano di tutto e, il bagnino che era mio amico ad un certo punto non aveva più posti per le sdraio, ombrelloni, sedie e tutto quello che serve in spiaggia mi chiese di non farne venire più, perchè non aveva più metterle le persone. Questo per me è la cosa più bella che potesse accadermi.

f0MHet4saa	Innamorarsi non è soltanto essere attratti da una persona, vederla bella e desiderabile. è un mutamento interiore di tutto l'essere. <br>  <br>  "Si rischia di fare lo stesso identico errore, ma si rischia di farne anche di peggiori! Detto in termini semplici,si rischia d'innamorarsi dell'uomo sbagliato, semplicemente perchè si ha il bisogno d'innamorasi e basta!Insomma, gli amori viziati dai bisogni sono destinati a naufragare. Per incontrare l'uomo giusto o la donna giusta, bisognerebbe essere liberi dai bisogni e aver fatto un lungo lavoro terapeutico su di sé. Ma questa è difficilissimo.. quasi un'utopia"<br>  <br>  <br>  durante il giorno, girovagando,  passo da answers e leggo un post sull'amore, sull'innamorarsi. E penso: magari è la solita "roba" ... Ma dovevo supporre che non lo era. Là non vi è nulla di scontato. <br>  "Meno male che qualcuno riesce a vivere l'amore" (leggo)<br>  Vivere l'amore... tutto va bene quando si è "in" amore.

Lui ti dice che non vuole che lo dici ai suoi perchè ha paura, però si rende conto che quello che fà è grave e pericoloso e che potrebbe rovinargli la vita per sempre. Se dice che si sente in colpa significa che comprende di sbagliare, comprende che ciò che fà non và bene, se pensi che stà correndo un pericolo grande prima di lasciarlo almeno avvisa chi potrebbe far qualcosa per lui.<br>  Per la tua vita non lasciare che il comportamente sbagliato di qualcuno ti trascini in situazioni di cui ti potresti pentire e magari non poter più ritornare indietro.  <br>  Hai provato a confidarti con i tuoi genitori?

Ho una  cara amica che aveva un problema simile al tuo... è stata vicino al suo ragazzo più che poteva, anche se purtroppo non è finita bene.

0YQRbq9faa	It may not be a phobia as much as an obsession or a compulsion. She has anxiety about someone attacking her or coming after her but if the door is shut and/or locked she is safe. <br>  <br>  OCD individuals have been known to check to see if a door is locked or closed over and over again even though they know it is locked.  The root cause of OCD in my opinion is guilt.  They feel deep seated guilt over something in their life, and they distract the guilt feelings by keeping busy with these rituals.<br>  <br>  Is she European?  We have several friends from Europe.  In their homes and in our home, they always close the doors behind them.  It is to keep the cold air out and the warm air in the room.  It is just their funny little way.

CEChcfKwaa	Some guys are socially retarded. I guess they figure if they hollar at enough women eventually they'll find one desperate enough to find it flattering. |`|1d3NreHbaa	Not all men do that, and the ones that do have no manners, or that they weren't brought up properly.<br>  I don't understand that myself, if they like you why cant they just go up to you politely and say it rather then shouting at you in a crude sexual manner?<br>  I find that behavior in men very unattractive.|`|IIYxx7eGaa	Like totally, everyone should be as repressed as I am.|`|Lbulud8raa	Jitterbug sums it up well, and is balanced too: women do this, and are far more overt about it.  Unclebob also has a good grasp of the realities here too.<br>  <br>  Being a man, it is very noticable that we have to measure how we approach women very carefully compared to the past.  Fortunately I am mostly an obersver of this, and I have never seen the need to deliberatelt flirt .  I am sure I must have done it, though I rather doubt I am a master of it.<br>  <br>  Many of these blokes are clumsy, judging by your descriptions of what happens, but it is actually better than being ignored all the time, I would think.  What you most likely seek is attention, but from the right sorts of men and at the right times.  This will come as you get older and you can better choose your associations.<br>  <br>  EDI "Or whatever my name is"?  Er, yes, it is shebs because that is my new email.  The owains one was shut down because I no longer use it.  I am not in any way claiming that you are an attention seeker, but you are kidding yourself and trying to kid me if you say you want no attention, ever, at all. for any reason.  Hence my claim is correct: attention in the right time and place by decent blokes (unless you are gay, of course).<br>  <br>  EDIT2<br>  Your life story?  True, not interested at all. I am sure I would be, well, bored by it. That's MY opinion and, well, the rest YOU outlined|`|O5sppBE3aa	I HAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTEEE this...so much so, that I used to spend a lot of time researching and found articles and even a documentary regarding this. One quot I really liked, spoke about how "straight men freak out in fear when homosexual men treat them in the very way that straight men treat women."<br>  <br>  Food for thought. Literally don't even look at them...but then again, that may pose a problem if they try to attack you and you do not know what they look like.<br>  <br>  Good luck - I enjoy your questions.|`|YHmr7nvsaa	You must be hot and these guys are trying to hit on you so you should be flattered.

Real men dont catcall.|`|86r27q1Eaa	Because if a man approached you in the same manner, you would say he invaded your personal space. This way he is safe, and still flirt with you. Now a days men are a little cautious of approaching women. What if men stop speaking to you at all, would you be happy?<br>  <br>  I always find it funny when women say these things are disgusting, when some women stick their tongue out, eat a banana seductively, walk different when they know a man is watching, or any other things women do to flirt. Women are just as guilty, if not worse. Just because they don't speak rudely, doesn't mean women don't act rudely. Men are just not petty like most women, when it comes to things like that.|`|8ldA7Z3Baa	Regardless to what many sexist people might say, men aren't the only ones who do that. Woman do the same, particularly ones in highschool. I'm a guy and I would get that alot from younger girls...girls usually with an alpha complex. They figured because I looked young, that I was around there age and wouldn't stop bothering me.<br>  <br>  This isn't a"man" problem, but more of a problem for alpha women and alpha men who don't know yet how to approach the opposite sex in a more subtle way.<br>  <br>  EDIT: It's My Opinion - I agree, it is a social problem. Problem is, there's all sorts of social problems that can't all be delt with efficiently or in a timely fashion. And some people are more heard than others when people bring up their specific social problems. Sometimes you can't rely on the countries laws to help you. You have to be smart about what your doing and help yourself, like finding ways to avoid these jacka*sses. <br>  <br>  Believe me, I had to do the same thing with other forms of social problems, and I'm a guy.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Thumbs down again huh? Why am I hated so? :)|`|9YlQ5HEhaa	Well, that happens all the time and to nearly all women. Don't take it so seriously, they just do it for fun or to get a reaction, and it's not a big deal.<br>  <br>  I hate when silly little girls make a fuss over something that the rest of us are able to shrug off. Harrassment - bollocks. I've been the victim of serious harrassment and if you honestly think a few cat calls in the street are an equivalent you need to take a good hard look at yourself and thank your gods that nothing serious has ever happened to you and that the biggest problem you have is a few silly comments.<br>  <br>  Do us all a favour and grow up.<br>  <br>  If you're twenty two, that makes it worse that you haven't grown up yet. And I said "IF those are the biggest problems you face" because I was assuming that if you had real problems you wouldn't be making a big deal out of that. Apologies if you do indeed have real problems, although how you have the time to get fussed up about this as well as deal with actual problems is beyond me.|`|9a8dcc5b6d79b07abd75628d8b093129aa	I'm sorry but i will have to agree with Munchkin<br>  <br>  You call THAT harassment?<br>  Men who do stuff like that are just looking for fun, or for you to laugh or react like that.<br>  <br>  Every woman goes trough that and some men too, whn other guys like "hey sup?" or "hey dude your backpack is huge, you goin camping?"<br>  Honestly, nobody cares.<br>  <br>  A guy who yells you sweetheart would be surprised as hell if you responded in the same way.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter if everyone experiences it or not, it's something very simple.<br>  This isn't pinky cute world, something is always going to bug you.<br>  <br>  I understand that women want rape to be gone...but hell, this is a serious exaggeration of nothing.<br>  <br>  If people talk to you, it's because you seem nice...<br>  <br>  Some people in Africa are dying from hunger while people ask if you came from school...<br>  <br>  <br>  Worry about something important<br>  <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081103/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_iraq;_ylt=Ag_I.Hqhe5hhkkJFxSxGLaebOrgF">http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081103/ap_o...</a>|`|l1CMHFcGaa	lol @ "you just came from school" oh really?<br>  yeah,their behavior disgusts me sometimes. alot of people dont think its a big deal,cause it probably doesnt happen to them several times a day. lol,that happens to me at the bustop all the time,i will be walking and hear somebody yelling "sweet heart,sweet heart" then they try to catch up to me and is like "how you doin ma?,thats all,smile" ugh!!|`|YXaooguxaa	Someone here, the person typing in all caps, needs to be aborted in mid-life by a brutal flogging.<br>  <br>  Those men sound like jerks.

It has been proven over and over that every time we learn something new the brain creates new connections called synapses. It's the old-in-heart that think they know it all that get dumber as they get older. Continuing to learn things, be it dancing, art, a language or whatever interests you, has been proven to stave off many brain-related diseases in the elderly.|`|e61e97ce7197ef3797fdc64f3b935342aa	Your short term memory holds 7+/-2 (between 5 and 9) To move information from your Short Term Memory (STM) to your Long Term Memory (LTM) the memory needs either be important/emotive or to rehearse the memory. However the Very Long Term Memory (VLTM) is believed to have an infinite amount of storage space.<br>  <br>  If you would like to know more about this theory you can search MIller's Multistore Model Of Memory|`|9ab7c5b30122db984710185845f90cbfaa	I read a story i couldn't find that was about a study on memory. They think that everything we see is stored for a long time a lot of memory is attributed to vision. If you ever felt you had been somewhere before and found out it was when you were a little kid you had a doctor there or something. It is because something you saw woke up a picture in your memory of that exact thing. We remember faces this way. So everything you see all day every day is stored somewhere. I would say as long as you can see, hear, feel, or smell you still have storage room.|`|gIcg7Ug2aa	I would say no.

GAHFiIqSaa	Everyone is telepathic, it is how spirits communicate, and points directly to our existence as spiritual beings. It is also how God hears our prayers.<br>  <br>  Ninety percent of ones thoughts are not his or her own; they are the thoughts of others. Telepathic thought is so fluid that it often goes unrecognized as the thoughts of another. Example: Think of a time when you had a verbal argument. When first separated from the other individual, most continue the argument in their own mind. What is happening is that the original argument is still occurring, but in a  telepathic form.<br>  <br>  Telepathy not only occurs with words, but with respect to feelings as well. One can literally feel the love, hatred, sadness, fear, etc. between two individuals. Most telepathic thought is non-verbal.<br>  <br>  Generally speaking, you must have at least met the individual once to communicate with them telepathically. This effectively puts you on the "same frequency" as the other individual. All one really has to do is think of an individual to communicate telepathically.<br>  <br>  Warning: Do not attempt the following if you do not want your life to be changed. How you talk to yourself, in your mind (without actually saying the words) is how one communicates (telepathically) with a spirit. Call out in your mind (loudly - without using your actual voice), "hello, can anyone hear me?" You will most likely hear a response in your mind as if you thought it. This will be the thoughts of a spirit. At first, you will think that it is really just your own thought - it is not. Ones communications has been established, you may simply continue the conversation. As indicated above, your life will be change by talking with a spirit. Once they know you are aware of them, they will make themselves known to you in other ways. They will not hurt you, but you may become uncomfortable or fearful concerning their attempts to escalate the relationship. Once you go down this road, there is no going back.|`|T8ksKCWCaa	What you are asking is very difficult to explain; similar to making a blind person understand the concept of colour. And even then, understanding the concept does not necessarily make it happen.|`|SUBKGSQNaa	It just comes into your mind, but doesn't feel like one of your thoughts. It has an insistent quality. It's a bit like being pregnant, when the baby is in your body and you can feel it there but it doesn't feel like part of your body, you can feel that it's something distinct.|`|jL8K9dMPaa	I believe in telepathy, or similar to it, but I don't know how to explain these things to you. It's just something that you feel, it's not really something that's obvious and blatant. Strange how it works but it's all about the 'feeling'.

6GmtcZteaa	I think weal people might be drawn by the confidence and the strengths the actors in the movies show. And yes might possibly follow certain things to be able to look as confident or scary. So it plays an affect on certain people. But certainly not as much as the people or the environment or the way that person was raised or brought up to behave do. Those are the things that should be looked into before blaming videos and films.
IK6FZ5TPaa	That is a really hard question.  I would probably die for my dogs, and my cat.  It just depends on who the person is.

But I love my animals way to much to let them die.xD|`|0fviV0lNaa	I could never love an animal enough to die for it.

YvWSqALtaa	The reason being normal is so hard is because nobody on this entire earth is normal. As human beings we are all fundamentally different and to state otherwise is absurd. <br>  <br>  If it is hard to conform to what your enviroment and not yourself desire you to be then simply refuse to do so. You have nothing to lose but your frustration.|`|T8ksKCWCaa	Because 'normal' is defined by society. And since society is constantly changing, what is normal changes all the time as well.|`|vXFpzKRaaa	Because being "normal" is to be someone other than yourself.  The world's view of normal is for the most part different from who you are.  You're supposed to be unique in your own special way and when you try to be normal, you're actually trying not to be yourself but trying to copy what others consider normal.  Ever see an apple try to be an orange...?  Doesn't happen.|`|NlWi9HHkaa	because you are trying to standardized yourself by other people's standard.|`|To3MFAOkaa	theres in no such thing as "being normal" it doesnt exist!! be urself.. if everyone was the same life wud b hell.. thats y u r u.. u r unique!!|`|WZVz5jWHaa	It's not for me.

B9NFOoKSaa	In the past, I used to have this problem all the time & it was very frustrating. I have a Partner & a friend with this very same problem, & can offer a solution which has worked well for me. I'm what is known as a "classic over-achiever" & tend to have my mind & thoughts going in many different directions at once & pursuing many different permutations of future timelines.<br>  <br>  I've found that using a "micro-meditation" technique to perform sort of a "running defrag" of my thoughts as I busy myself through the day has been very useful. Once you get used to doing it, running it in the "background", you'll be able to smoothly & confidently accomplish lots more without the nagging feeling of leaving or forgetting something.<br>  <br>  I establish a pattern, & a place, for everything & I _always_ stick to it. It takes some discipline to start with, & constant self-review, but as time goes by, I find that consciously needs to be done less & less & I enjoy the glow of knowing where each thing is & whether I have locked the door, etc. It gets to the point of being automatic. If there should be an occasional slip-up, I can use a logical step-by-step process to trace back where something was left or whether something was or was not done.<br>  <br>  In your school or friend's house, ask where it is customary or proper to put your (their) things & stick to that. Focus on your actions as if you are performing a slow dance or ballet of movement. Give yourself a congratulation every time you succeed & when you don't, analyze it & make a plan to change it. Avoid the static interference of self-recrimination or emotional turmoil to upset you.<br>  <br>  I hope that this helps. It works for me!|`|D5VY6Ffdaa	In regards to forgetting things in school, classrooms, other people's houses: right before I leave my house, I go through in my mind of all the important things I have with me, like wallet, keys, cellphone, ipod, etc... and so before I leave any place I go through that list in my head, and I always look back at my desk, or where I was sitting, to see if there's anything there that's mine that could've either fallen out of my bag or pockets or that I just simply forgot.<br>  <br>  The more you do something like this, the less likely you'll be to forget things! Just make it a habit to look back at where you were sitting... that can help you a lot!<br>  <br>  Good luck =)|`|L6U1joGAaa	Maybe you should slow down a little, you probably have too much on your plate. The average memory capacity on the human brain can only hold so much at a time and likely puts a few of the not so important things aside.|`|NlWi9HHkaa	focus.|`|k2AmQylBaa	put the things u need in the same spot everytime u use it so u know where it is and also put things that u need in ur backpack ahead of time so u don't forget|`|p6Pv6ioOaa	I think there are a lot of tips and tricks, but I think the most important thing to help you is to be more organized, and to structure your day a bit more.  Try to lay everything you need for the day out the night before.  Looking at it sitting all together will help you remember.  Or if you can't stick to that, make a checklist of things you need or might need, and review it every morning before you leave.|`|SmPOWbD6aa	Yes, friend, u keep yourself always in hurry. Pay less interest in important matters. Do not maintain a diary. Do not have a secretary.<br>  u have less concentration in your own matters. How can u rectify?<br>  Try, from tomorrow, when first matter comes, go through minutely. repeat once again. taken a decision, when to do, what to do and when?<br>  continue in alll matters, yr memory will work excelent. But remember me to call.|`|RT8LZy7gaa	If it's just little things you're forgetting, like not picking up milk or other little chores, write yourself a note and put it where you'll see it.  That's what I do. <br>  <br>  Memorizing stuff is best handled by repeating as noted by the other folks but it you're talking about a one time chore to do, if you go around repeating everything, people will think you're nuts (they think I'm nuts!)<br>  <br>  The notes work for me. If it's something I'm supposed to remember on the way home, I put a sticky note on my car radio. And I don't take it off until I did what I'm supposed to do. (like buy a sketchbook for my son's art class).<br>  <br>  Hope that's helpful!|`|khbSXMcIaa	keep repeating things over and over in your head. one teacher told me that in order to remember something, you have to think or say it at least seven times. since you'll think about them a lot, you won't forget.<br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|hmhxjrRqaa	concentrate honey<br>  ahhhh
aeZZu1HOaa	A lot of his theory concerning religion is based on the assumption that people are using God as a father figure.  As you probably know, Freud was a big proponent of the idea that children have a sexual attraction to the parent of the other gender.  God functions as an unavailable father figure for the kid in that case; the boy will never grow up and supplant him (since he's ageless) and the girl will never experience any physical sexual relationship with him (since he's a spirit).  It gets even more weird, I've included a link for you.|`|RT8LZy7gaa	I believe Oedipus was the dude that had sexual feelings for his mother - which, as far as I know, Incest is against every religion.|`|SmPOWbD6aa	Now, this is deep midnight and i am to take dinner and go to bed. But one thing i tell u friend, freud does not tell anything without sex. Therefore, examine properly but i am going to bed. Meet u next session.

OncdpDunaa	Yeah, I stopped playing that fake role a long time ago. It's not worth it. If you wanted to be an actor, I'm sure you would have gone into acting. Being someone your not, is too stressful. Now is the time to say heck with it, and just be who God intended you to be. There may be some loss of friends, but if they are your true friends they will appreciate the real you. Stop killing yourself. Be you and no body else. Just think of the stress you will relieve. God wants you the way you are because he has great things in store for you. Keep that in mind. And you can always count on me to give you the truth. I will be your friend no matter what. I am not judgmental. Good luck and God Bless.|`|s3YuchHoaa	Be yourself but be respectful of other people . People may not understand you expressing yourself on higher levels of thought . Be eccentric but not egocentric.In some cercumstances it isn't okay to express yourself. Isn't being funy, outgoing, relaxed , happy go lucky a part of you . Express yourself but make sure you showing yourself is showing the positive of yourself and not your negative aspects.You can be yourself trulely when you are being the best you can be and the best you can be is yourself.|`|NlWi9HHkaa	you have to accept yourself first before people can accept you for who you really are.  if you don't like your real self, how do you expect people to like your real self?  and you have to accept the fact that no one can please everybody as this absolutely leads to frustrations; until you refuse to live in frustrations, you will have to start pleasing yourself.|`|9VzCaf0eaa	Well, first off, you're heading in the right direction by admitting that you've been a fake. Maintain the attitude that you have now and continue to do what you want to do and voice your opinion in the way that is YOU.  This will undoubtedly make you lose a lot of your existing "friends" but that doesn't matter anyway because if they don't like the REAL you then why should they matter at all.  However, this is mainly your fault for acting a fake in the past so don't blame the people that don't want to be your friends in the recent future.  Now that you've made a decision that you want to be yourself so act accordingly and accept the outcomes.  The sooner you establish yourself to the people around you the sooner you'll get accepted as...YOU.|`|cHkH7ESuaa	OMG!  I feel this way too!!<br>  <br>  There are only a couple people in this world that TRULY know the real me because I always watch myself around people and adjust my personality to match theirs.  I can never just be myself.  <br>  <br>  I feel like I don't have a personality anymore because I've supressed it for so long - like, I'm not sure I really have opinions on anything!  I used to be opinionated, but then I started caring what people thought, and now my opinions change based on who I'm with.<br>  <br>  For example (using initials) when I'm with K I'm an Obama supporter that thinks recycling is important, but when I'm with J I'm a McCain supporter that thinks recycling fanatics are stupid.<br>  <br>  When I'm with C I wear cute sweater-sets and talk about how much I hate slutty girls, but when I'm with S I wear sexy shirts and shamelessly flirt with guys.<br>  <br>  When I'm with F I talk about how excited I am for the new Sex & The City movie, but when I'm with T I say the new Sex & The City movie will be stupid.<br>  <br>  When I'm with P I'm a vegetarian and I'm dying to learn how to play golf, but when I'm with N I think vegetarians are stupid and that golfing is a boring sport for old people.<br>  <br>  When I'm with M I have no problems gossiping about strangers and laughing at their outfits, but when I'm with C I'm really sweet to everyone and would never say anything mean behind someones back.<br>  <br>  When I'm with Q I talk about how I like guys for their personalities and that their jobs and money don't matter to me, but when I'm with W I talk about how I could never be with a guy that does manual labor because they don't make enough money.<br>  <br>  When I'm with Y I like going to dive bars but when I'm with H I'll only go to expensive wine bars because dive bars are crawling with the scum of the earth.<br>  <br>  AAAGGHH!!!!  anyway, you get the idea.  I guess I didn't really answer your question though, did I??  sorry :(

yqUgRG2raa	Hopefully in 50 years, people will realize what I realized in 1999, when this problem first was noticed by me and I have been yelling about since the Clinton Administration started it that you can't put big taxes on people without a fallout. If we get a bigger dose of the ideas of the past and do not review the Carter/Johnson adminstration and that big crash then the archaeologist will be from another nation who will be studing us. Don't tax people, educate them, tell them to try to be more than sport stars and rock/rap stars. Give free education, not free handouts.  If we do this there may be some anthropologist in 50 years.|`|Vj13f7zmaa	Um.. 50 yrs?  Hopefully most of us will still be alive in 50 yrs and won't be studied by archaeologists yet... they usually study things thousands or even millions of years old.|`|6og9REH5aa	Far far into the distant future (say.... 50 years from now), archaeologists will look back and wonder how we could have been so unbelievably stupid!  <br>  <br>  Why didn't we vote in our own self interest?  <br>  <br>  Why did we vote to fill the pockets of the Super Rich with more money and crash our own Stock Market?|`|c3316a5f71249d75a984bd40fa3e4358aa	I am not sure there will be a world as we know about it then.

Or, you could post your question here under the title: 'Attention Psychiatrists".
A71Uu05Uaa	There are many women who are like a gaping abyss looking to fill themselves up with a man's attention.<br>  <br>  It's usually related to lacking self esteem and self awareness.  Also being raised to believe there's nothing wrong with you when there really is.  It's bad for parents to treat their girls like magical princesses who's farts don't stink.  <br>  <br>  They grow up incomplete.  Like a child stuck in an adult body with no clue of their situation within themselves.  Constantly seeking attention and external validation.  Driven by fear.  Fear of people leaving her or not liking her.<br>  <br>  These are often the "high maintenance" women.  They need constant reassurance that you "love" them.  Even though, they don't really understand love much at all.  They are simply addicted to the attention and afraid of being left.  They don't really love you because they can't even love themselves yet.<br>  <br>  Now, growing up to be a competent woman who knows she wants to be a stay at home mom with a well off man is one thing.  These women are willing to work and make money themselves. They have a sense of duty and are willing to work hard both in the work place and at home once the children come into the picture.<br>  <br>  The ones that you should avoid anything long term with...  are the ones who aren't willing to work for anything.  Like Capricorn said, they are playing the role of a child and just want to be taken care of.<br>  <br>  ---------------<br>  And as far as ugly, fat men wanting hot chicks.  Well yeah, I imagine most guys want a hot chick.  But I betcha an ugly, fat man would be quite happy with just about any woman as long as she doesn't look like something you'd find in a barn.<br>  <br>  I've found that men are generally aware of their own situation and know the difference between dreams and realistic standards.|`|YQOT68xFaa	I am a big fan of Dr Laura. I haven't listened regularly since 2006 but back then she used to tell people something now and again that really stuck with me. She said that too often, people are more concerned with finding the right person and forget all about *being* the right person. And there are a ton of women who do that. We like fairy tales and we want love to be that way. It ain't. The sooner people wake up and realize that, the better.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	Isn't this funny?  I've met women that are all, "I won't date a guy that doesn't drive a Lexus", while the she herself doesn't even have bus fare for work.  The guy has to make 6 figures a year or more, while she has $23 in the bank.<br>  <br>  It's pathetic, but it stems down to women who look for men to 'take care of them'. They're putting themselves in a child's place.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Well some of those requirements I just can't manage no matter hard I try, like male genitalia.

But since when did that ever stop the human heart from wanting what it wants?  Haven't you ever heard of the women who demands a big-pocketed mate, but is as poor as a church mouse?  And just as typical, the young man who expects a beauty queen but is no Clark Gable himself.|`|AA11429880	The only thing I "require" of a man is that he be respectful, honest, and sexually compatiable.

I see plenty of ugly, obese, middle aged men, who seem to feel entitled to a young hot 23 year old.|`|80YPHmm7aa	There is nothing wrong with wanting what you want. But, you have an interesting theory. I can honestly say that I bring to the table the same things that I would want in another.<br>  <br>  I work, have good credit, and a small retirement plan. I'm not rich, but I'm stable. I'm not gorgeous, but I'm not hard to look at, and have a go-with-flow laid back personality. I've had a couple of years of college.<br>  <br>  So, in summary, I would be looking for and equal. I agree that you should address your own issues and not expect another to "fix" you. It's not fair to to the other party to shoulder you're problems.  <br>  <br>  Self-actualization and introspection can be painful, but, imho, is necessary before entering into any substantial relationship.|`|9okusH1kaa	It seems a certain type of woman has this list. It transcends race, (although black women are particularly famous for this), class, politics, etc. <br>  <br>  There are women in all spectrums that have lists of requirements for their man. Rich feminists have lists and poor black women in the ghetto have lists. These women usually end up getting banged by some random men for most of their youth and then ending up alone because they're lists impose standards that are just too high. <br>  <br>  The high standards come from a variety of sources, according to the speculation that I've read. For instance, many women are told that they can have everything they want and they can expect princes to come into their lives and that they shouldn't accept anything but the best from men. It is similar to how some men believe they are tough and strong even though they are flabby and haven't exercised in years. Also there are ugly men and fat men that haven't had any girl that believe they deserve and are holding out for 10s. I have a friend that fits this description. <br>  <br>  I do not believe that this is a new occurance, as there were always women that spent their entire lives as spinsters waiting for Mr. Right. <br>  <br>  Salon's Broadsheet had a few articles about this phenom, (although they were written in support of this, because women should expect the man of their dreams, even in their late 40s) and it is becoming well-recognized.<br>  <br>  The counter somebody can use is to ask: "Oh, yeah? Well, what do you offer?" The women get visibly upset by this.<br>  <br>  Most people aren't like this and will take people as they come. If you do find someone like this they should be avoided. However, all people should have a list of characteristics that they are looking for in a partner, but they shouldn't have ridiculously high expectations.
3AVHxNNTaa	You're psychic and everything in the dream happened.|`|uxwSd0KLaa	According to me your dream reflects the fear you have about your father having a mistress ; and because you ae stress it came up in your dream|`|5eoO6qosaa	A mistress could also be something that is taking his time away from the family,  working too much,  a hobby,  just not being there for the family. The rest of the family might not notice or think that he is gone too much, but your dream is telling you that you feel he has outside of the family interests.  Good luck! :)|`|AA12360662	Stress may be a trigger to this dream. However, the focus is not really on your father.  <br>  <br>  Projecting father to have a mistress confronting your mother and your sister may reflect some helplessness in your family.  Whether this is directly about your own family or family of your father, you are feeling lack of control, lack of making your own decision in life.  <br>  <br>  The mistress basically is an excuse from your subconscious mind to reflect things you can't do much in reality. That is a symbol of helplessness.  Think about it, what can you do if your father does have mistress, since you and your sister are grown up  and your father is not young any more.  <br>  <br>  Confronting part basically suggests there is some incompleteness in the household.  You are feeling incomplete somehow, so having argument in dream may mean of some disappointment or discontent about family life you have now.<br>  <br>  <br>  Again, this may not directly point to your parents, it may be about you.  Examine your life, and you know exactly what it is.|`|5FggA8Dwaa	Something happened between you and your father, it maybe something that he said or did or not do that could be stemming the dream. When you start yelling, that's a sign of your true emotions or your fraustration at the situation. <br>  You should speak with your dad if you could about the situation - or maybe it's not a big deal it's all on you. <br>  - Hope I wasn't on left field or something.|`|LJ0fRcMGaa	it means he's having a good time in dreamland!|`|AA10453354	I need more details if you can<br>  1- do you know the girl in the dream?<br>  2- was your father happy with her?<br>  <br>  for now I think your dream means that your father life will have a little change in the near future. the changes will affect the family in general but especially you.<br>  for the near future try to keep closer to your father and ask your sister to visit him as well.
wK98LX5laa	Okay well first off you have low self esteem which makes you think you're not good enough for her when you are. The low self esteem makes you second guess yourself in every department of life. It makes you rethink everything you do.<br>  You need to talk to her, admit to her you lied, and tell her why you did it. Talk to her about your insecurities. Then let HER decide what she wants to do in this relationship. Its her opinion you are worried about. You need to let her have a say in it. You can't assume she isn't happy or good off with you when she may be happier than ever.|`|GEfUTyi8aa	low self esteem... abandoned in your past where it really hurt so you dont think your good enough and your dumping her before she can dump and abandon you.<br>  <br>  You oboviously have some abandonment issues... you need to deal with those via professional counselor before you do this over and over again.... and you will.<br>  <br>  good luck
b4859935d2256537b4d4fe1dd1d4888faa	I am always fidgeting.  My fingers, my feet.  I'm always doing it.  I know for me I noticed ladies at my church doing it during the service and I thought it was cool in a grownup sort of way because if I had tried that as a kid I would have been told to sit still.  But here were all these adults not sitting still during church! <br>  I guess it's just habit for me.  It drives my husband buts.  He swears I shake the 'entire car' when I move my foot.<br>  Maybe its like playing air drums.  I don't think I've ever seen a girl just chilling out, playing a pair of drums that only she can see.|`|AA11307468	Sometimes it's nervous energy.

Im a well known twitcher and i cant tell you why i do it...Im going for the "its just dangling there"|`|XIbct4fuaa	Its just a nervous habit I think.  It might mean she is bored, or nervous, or excited.|`|gd64wAYKaa	it means they are anxious. if a woman does that she doesnt want to be around you.|`|bEQe1bNmaa	What? lol. Nervous energy I guess. Do you never fidget or something?
KCpGsN2faa	Yeah, you're normal,. I used to be that way. I couldn't keep a boyfriend, didn't really have any desire at all for one. Then I met my fiancee and for the first time in my life, I actually felt something. And it was STRONG. I know without a shadow of a doubt I could never love anyone as much as I love him. I think you are just like me in that you are more mature and worried about sensible things like school, and also perhaps you are one of those people who don't love easily but when you do, its the realest thing out there. Don't worry, you will find someone, and he will really rock your world.|`|TuzIGJpaaa	When growing up and going through puberty, different physical and mental features develop at different times. <br>  <br>  You may not be attracted to boys yet because the physical and mental aspects that make you attractted to boys has not fully developed.<br>  <br>  Do not worry at all, the answer to your question is, yes, you are completely normal. Give it time, and eventually you will start to be attracted to people like everyone else.|`|xsyAljhaaa	Don't worry about it. Just because your body developed early, doesn't mean that your mind/attitudes developed at the same pace.

Just because you are not into immature guys doesn't mean that you will start being attracted to women all of a sudden.|`|s3IBrhZCaa	ah hell, dont even worry about it. you are better off. trust me you are better off.|`|b4859935d2256537b4d4fe1dd1d4888faa	I was the same at your age.  I didn't date until college, and then only when I knew I had found Mr. Right.  Like you, I couldn't be bothered with boys and their immaturity, their completely different hobbies, and their overall boy-ness.  I just wasn't putting up with it.  I had some guy friends, but mostly just stuck with my pack of girls.  There's nothing wrong with you.  This could be a blessing in disguise.  You can focus on your school and getting good grades and not all the boy/girl crap drama that goes on.|`|pYimIJAWaa	You're normal. When you see the guy who 'does it for you' you'll get that butterfly feeling too. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry about the fact that you don't see what your friends get all gushy about about that guy - often that guy is an A#@@hole anyway. I never saw what my all friends would see in certain guys, but have had happy relationships with good men since then. <br>  <br>  btw, not being attracted to a guy does not equate to being a lesbian. Being a woman who is attracted to women defines being a lesbian. Probably you'd know by now, as most gay people I know knew from the start they were 'different', it just sometimes took some of them a while to figure out why and/or to accept it.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|IOK8qUBjaa	"i didn't think i'm late developing because i have the biggest boobs out of us and i started my period first out of all the girls in my last school. but i just really cant be bothered with guys and they cant be bothered with me. am i normal?"<br>  <br>  T.M.I (pronounced Timmy), other than that your 15, just hang with your girls and enjoy your youth.|`|XIbct4fuaa	You are normal.  Those feelings develop at a different rates for everyone and they arent tied to your physical development.  There is no need to rush...boys will still be there when you are ready.
ce2b902766c5387aeab3a7b3b3fded98aa	there's a chemical imbalance that kind of is the backbone to anxiety....<br>  <br>  more like stressors and possible emotional triggers... like let's say Tim gets nervous when he's near a baseball diamond because his dad forced him to play for little league in his childhood.<br>  <br>  you know, it's just fear, discomfort, stress, emotions, it's a lot of things...<br>  <br>  it even could be from drugs...|`|8itmfU1naa	Its basically obsessive thinking. You think too much into things and then it becomes a burden..i have acute anxiety n it effects everything in my everyday life..<br>  <br>  Like u could worry about work you have to do for college, and think about failing, then considering urself a failure..and it spirals into sometimes a panic attack which is what happens to me.|`|yuBghGbraa	Well in terms of anxiety disorders, I think it's a combination of biological factors and external/environmental factors.<br>  <br>  I'm genetically predisposed for anxiety disorder (My father's side has tons of cases paranoid personality disorder, general anxiety disorder, and a case of what appears to be borderline personality disorder or schizotypal personality disorder, although I'm not qualified to say). An imbalance in neurotransmitters/hormones related to anxiety and the fight or flight mechanism (like epinephrine) would most certainly have an effect on your overall anxiety level.<br>  <br>  Of course not everyone with a genetic predisposition for anxiety disorders will have one. Environmental/external factors effect gene expression, so a psychological response to something in the environment could trigger the expression of the 'anxiety gene'. <br>  <br>  And of course, life situations can most definitely affect one's anxiety level, especially in the case of abused children, low income earners, people with any uncertainty about the outcome of their lives could be anxiety prone that wouldn't be otherwise.<br>  <br>   In the case of people without anxiety disorders, the anxiety leaves after the stressful situation comes to an end. With a disorder, the symptoms continue long after the situation ends, and often get worse with time. <br>  <br>  Just my two cents.|`|Ruifi0GSaa	I have Anxiety, it will hit me when I don't even expect it. Like driving on a busy freeway, waiting in a line at a grocery store ext. or waiting for the red light to change, in crowds of people, on a high area (buildings or mountains). I have been reading this book about it, it's called "The Monster In The Cave" How to Face your Fear and Anxiety and Live Your Life.<br>  I haven't had this all my life, but it started with something traumatic that I had seen, and that was when my mother died, I had seen her die in the hospital, and my life forever changed because of it. It felt like I had lost my security blanket of sorts.<br>  The book explains that this small village of people would always go the long way around this cave, they thought there was a monster that lived in the cave. So instead of walking by the cave they would spend a whole lot of time just to avoid it.<br>  Doctors do have medicine for this type of disorder, but I think people take way to much stuff as it is.<br>  So will do the planning and practice worksheets that's in the book, and see if it helps.<br>  Hope that helps, take care. :)|`|9MXG3O74aa	I don't believe in that chemical embalance crap. Because I don't have one. What makes me have anxiety is being treated bad by other people. Like being picked on and stuff.
uKrRyVgVaa	Reunification weakened the German economy because eastern Germans economy was on the verge of collapse or it was collapsed. Also the government exchange rate for Eastern money and western money was 1=1(its like you USA citizen coming to UK and when changing money from dollars to UK sterling would get ￡100 for $100) where in fact the rate was something like 1 mark = 100 eastern money so poor would become middle class.|`|2b9d44a2626e8bffeebd493f9eb0199eaa	Economic protectionism and essentially economic apartheid are not the way that we will improve our economic status. (Your assumption is also flawed because you're assuming that the economic situation between Scotland and England is the same as Germany's post 1945.) <br>  <br>  What Britain and every country desperately needs to do is to come to to the correct diagnosis of what got us into this financial crisis in the first place and that was our egoism. By that I mean our desire and willingness to use, exploit and manipulate each other for our own gain.  That's what really got us into this mess in the first place.  We have to start relating to each other in essentially a much kinder way than we are currently. <br>  <br>  Gordon Brown has stated recently that the best way for all of the countries to come out of this crisis is by uniting. We saw in the Great depression in the US, that when countries turned to economic protectionism it actually prolonged the crisis. Gordon Brown is rightly speculating that we have to unite in order to save the situation. <br>  <br>  However In order for us to unite and start relating to each other from the point of view of mutual reciprocity it means that human beings need to change there inherently centred nature. The way that can be changed can be found on the following video: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhoTCiNrdW4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhoTCiNrd...</a>|`|GHefTsUyaa	Scotland would be better off and that's all I care about.|`|6296beaabcf8f4682bfa047d500f8e9aaa	Yes, the remainder of the UK would be better off.  So you may as well drop NI as well as that sucks money from the rest.  And Wales is a basket case too, economically.  So just England is best.  And you may as well remove the North as that is economically backwards.  And the South West.  Let's just have London as a country and to hell with the rest.<br>  <br>  And I hope you enjoyed spending Scotland's oil money for all those years.|`|AA12299134	I don't think reunification weakened the German economy.  It has probably 'diluted' what was the powerful West German economy for about three decades, but when they finally get the East up to scratch, it will be a very powerful entity indeed.
