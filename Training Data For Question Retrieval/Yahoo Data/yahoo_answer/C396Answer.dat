fofzdoROaa	The thermostat is an automatic way of controlling the temperature, and it is not working so you are being cooked! <br>  <br>  Is there some other way for you to control the temperature manually? If so and it is of an on-off nature, all you need to do is to anticipate when it is going to be too hot and switch off. Then when it is going to be too cold switch on. At night in bed use a quilt (or several, if its very cold out) you will not need such large amounts of heat anyway.<br>  <br>  Alternatively inside the thermostat there is a metal strip which changes its curvature according to the temperature. This strip controls an electrical switch which is the same kind of action as if you were doing it by hand as described above. Try to bend this metal strip so that it is less close to switching on and more close to switching off. <br>  <br>  Note: before touching any electrical wires or contacts make sure there is no connection with the electrical supply, by switching off the main supply at the meter. And after your adjustment switch it back on. REPEAT THIS INSTRUCTION EVERY TIME YOU NEED TO MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT because almost certainly it will take several attempts.|`|PKha8D7oaa	I don't really think its a thermostat problem but if you hate it that much you might want to get a new one before you damage it out of frustration. LOL. It sounds like to me that your heat strips are stuck on. This is a heating element inside your unit that is NOT a DIY project. So I would call your landlord and tell him to send over a "real" repairman. One with maybe a HVAC license. I can't believe that’s all he did to try and fix your problem. Hope this helps...best of luck to you.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	All I can say is hire your own contractor to come fix it. Expect to pay for it because you hired the contractor. Or you can lay into your land lord about needing more work done.|`|KvguovfWaa	sound like you need a new thermostat i know you said this but the landlord didnt replace it alternatively it could be a low voltage problem depending on how old the air handler is it could be a bad sequncer or relay but i am leaning toward the thermostat also you can manually control it by the breaker in your apt

My bro-in-law had on on a Franklin stove that was made in Wisconsin for many years that thermostatically activated, would blow air through a heat exchanger that was mounted in the flue pipe heating a room many times more than what was normal. This site has a setup for fireplaces. There is fireplace inserts that will actually draw air from the bottom and circulate it around the isolated fireplace insert creating a heat exchanger itself.

WhF21sZaaa	I work for a local lumberyard and we have been selling ICF forms for the last 15 years. Alot of builders in this area use them. They are a little more expensive, but are worth the extra cost.<br>  The down side comes when you run electrical and hang sheetrock. You need to take the time to do it right.|`|wj8FNY7Vaa	I did not use Zego blocks but I did you a foam form to build my own basement and have helped build several other homes with several types of forms and entire homes from ICF forms.<br>  <br>  My wife and I constructed the entire foundation and frost walls out of ICF forms.  The ones I used had a 3" wide steel channel that ran the entire height of the basement walls (9 feet in my case) every 12".  You build the frame first then you slide the 2 1/2" thick panels down from the top on all the channels.  This worked well for laying in re-bar etc.  Finished r-25 walls ready for drywall on the inside and siding on the outside.<br>  <br>  I picked this type because I did not like the thinner plastic channels that come with some brands.  I did not like the block type because you has to seal the blocks together.  <br>  <br>  I poured the walls myself with the help of 2 friends.  I would highly recommend ICF products.|`|2fGHF3RQaa	Wow, I have never heard of it before but I just entered it and searched in Yahoo, that's amazing, I would go for it if I was you.|`|WZdEdgxwaa	I have been personally involved with several ICF (insulated concrete forms) jobs over the years (usa).I love them and very simple to build.Remember this system has been in use all over Europe for over 20+ years with remarkable utility savings.<br>  <br>  Builders here (usa) just don't seem to "get it" when it comes to energy efficient homes.There are some out there but most people won't go the little extra cost for long term savings.This is actually a very simple DIY thing and most distributors have an excellent support network.So if one is construction savy it should be very easy.<br>  <br>  Google "ICF forms or ICF homes" and you should find some great info.<br>  <br>  My Best
FEOxxZJSaa	The only reason you would need to use morter would be to flatten the surface to provide a solid surface for the new base.<br>  If the new base does not set flat and stable it could move and/or crack which would allow water seepage.<br>  If you need the flat stability and do not want any adhesive qualities sand can be used to provide the support and stability.<br>  IT IS YOUR CHOICE... but consider the manufacture recommendations before you decide.
fofzdoROaa	Are you testing it for resistance or for heating?<br>  <br>  For heating, simply switch on the power to it starting from cold. leave it on for 10 minutes and then feel around the housing to see if it got warm.<br>  <br>  For electrical resistance, as a safety precaution switch off and disconnect the electrical power, but if there is a switch connecting the element to the input to the heater it should be on. <br>  <br>  Measure the electrical resistance between earth and each side of the heating element. Both readings should be more than 10,000 ohms indicating an open circuit which is what you need. Then measure the resistance across the element which should be low and between 2 and 20 ohms. Remember that when the element is heating, its resistance will be more.<br>  <br>  That's about all you can do. Some elements will pass these tests and still give trouble because they are unreliable when hot, in which case you need a replacement.|`|346e6e2923d4e46195fcf8100cba96beaa	I'm not sure what an immersion heater is, but water heater elements on most 240v heaters pull 18 amps.<br>  I check for power at the elements terminals, (220v-252v usually), then I check for current, (amperage usually 18-22amps).<br>  <br>  Checking ohms can be deceiving unless you have the element removed from the unit. I quit doing that 20 years ago.<br>  <br>  I hope you can use this info.<br>  <br>  Just looked up what an immersion heater is. I guess that's another name for the elements in water heaters, so you should be able to test it in the manner I have given you.

KvguovfWaa	Is there hot water in the rest of your house? if so than its probably the tub valve it self  some valves seize up and only allow cold or hot water to come through if you dont have hot water in the rest of your house than its probably time for a new heating element in your hot water heater or the thermostat is going bad|`|KHtPan4Jaa	Agreed - if you have hot water in the rest of your house, and you once did have hot water coming through you tub, there is now something wrong with the faucet.

You can build raised beds no more than 4' wide, so you can reach everything, and as long as you like.  Mark it off so you have divisions that are 1' square (for example, if you made it 4' by 12', you could plant 48 squares.  Each square can hold a variety of different vegetables, like 16 radishes or carrots, 9 beets or green onion plants, etc, depending on the size of the vegetable.  You could plant herbs in one of the squares, too.  And whenever one square is harvested, you can replant it with the next crop.  Even if you do that, you'd still have room to plant 2 rows of tomato plants , zucchini/summer squash, peppers or eggplants  about 2' apart with a 3' walkway in between each row (about 12 plants total).  Happy gardening!
maVptaMZaa	It depends on what the stains are and what material you want to remove the stains from. You will have to look at the label on each garment.  For instance, wool or any other natural fibre should not be washed at a high temperature otherwise it will shrink. <br>  I don't know about your Oxi-Action stuff, never used it, but I use Vanish.

Buy Ariel gel, and coat the stains with it undiluted by hand and leave for 15mins. Then using your washing machine dose for a full load, in a hard water area and use a 60C wash programme with dwell for stain removal. If your washing machine does not have this programme then use the longest 60C programme by time. It works for me

If you can't, put some nail polish remover on a Q-tip and use it very sparingly to get off the polish.  Keep in mind that leather is cow skin, so this should work fine.  Then get a good shoe polish and work it in until the area turns black again.  If they are shiny boots, you may lose some of the shine.

AA10648704	You'll need to dig up what you have, usually with a turf cutter if you have large areas.  For small areas, you can use a small garden tool that looks like an adze, and roll the old grass up in 1-2' lengths as you go.  You might need to break up the soil underneath if it's hard clay.  When you lay the sod, lay the pieces as tightly together as possible.  Start in one corner, and lay them like bricks--stagger the seams.  Don't walk on it any more than you have to for about the first week, and keep it well watered for at least a month, then water as you normally would.|`|0m7kEIDiaa	doing the preparation is ALL important... get rid of the old turf and dig over the whole of the area removing any stones,,.. then tread down the whole thhg ith your feet  and rake it so it's absolutely flat.  Add some fertilizer and rake that in too.  when you order the turf make sure the ground is fully prepared when it arrives.. turf won't survive long in the rolls it comes in.      Lay it carefully and keep off it until you can't turn up a corner of it anymore,  meaning that it has rooted well.    sites that sell turf often have short videos to show you how to prepare ground and are very helpful as to which type of grass you should get..    I hope it turns out well.. there is nothing like a newly laid lawn!|`|d8f443bc582285db859040a0c5e47adcaa	green side up mate----green side up

V4jecXwjaa	Hi! The basic formula is Length X Width X Height. For example, you have a Length of 15 feet, a Width of 5 feet, and you are missing 1 measurement, which is the height, or depth, of what you are applying.     For Example, You want to know how much compost you need to apply to your garden. Since square feet is Length X Width, your measurement is 75 square feet. Times this by the amount you are to apply to your garden, which may (just for example) be 3 inches. since 3 inches/12 inches is equal to .25 inches, you multiply this number by your square feet.     75 square feet X .25 inches =  18.75 Cubic feet. That is the amount of Compost you need to buy in order to cover the area.    Summary: Cubic Feet = Length X Width X Height  OR                  Cubic Feet= Square Feet X Height|`|dXrHoLMCaa	one more measurement, please....     for example... if you wanted this to measure mulch.... and your garden area is 15 ft by five feet, then you still need to tell how deep you want the mulch... four inches?....     (cubic feet) = (square feet)  (height in feet)  (?) = (15 x 5) x (.33 ft) {{four inches, or one third ft..}}  (?) = (75 sqft)x (.33ft)  (24.75 cu ft)    and if you get three cu ft per bag of mulch then you need      3 into 25 =8 or 9 bags, however you wish...    http://www.onlineconversion.com/faq_01.h...|`|hNfOgNNBaa	You probably want to figure how many 'cubic yards' of material you need. Therefore,    cubic feet (ft3)= x(ft) * y(ft) * z(ft)  x= 15, y= 5, z= ?     lets say that z= 3" or .25 ft.:  therefore,    15ft * 5ft * .25ft.= 18 ft3  or 18.75 cubic feet.    Convert cubic feet to cubic yards by dividing by 27:    18.75 cu. ft./ 27 =1.44 or 1.5 cubic yards of material

83b9c11562d344b8e4284f71b30ebb2caa	Wait until the snow and freezing has cleared, and then there are 2 main ways to get a good lawn, or grass covering - turfing or sowing seed.<br>  <br>  Seed sown lawns are the cheapest,  and allow you to choose what type of grass varieties are grown, as you can select tough hard-wearing, shady area grasses or very fine leaved ornamental grasses, for example.<br>  <br>  If you're not sure whether there is grass underneath the snow, wait until spring arrives, and see what's there, as you may have good healthy grass plants that are just under cover.  If it's patchy, you can add new seeds to any bare spots, and these will quickly grow and fill in these patches.<br>  <br>  Turf lawns are more immediate, but are considerably more expensive, so this in part will be determined by your budget.  Whichever type of lawn you create, it's important to keep new laid turf and seed grown lawns watered, until well established.  You can feed them in spring time too, which will get them to establish and grow more quickly.  <br>  <br>  The main key to getting a good healthy lawn is to get the ground well prepared beforehand, evening the surface,  removing any rubble and weed roots etc.    Deal with any other issues that there may be, such as poor drainage, as it's easier to deal with before you've created your lawn, rather than afterwards.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and Good luck!

kYahaaVuaa	I would try a different unit (or even different brand) and see if the results are the same. You might even try getting separate smoke/CO detectors and try different locations. And if it goes off again, I would have the fire department come and check more than the basement (and they should use two detectors to make sure THEIR readings are accurate). There's a whole myriad of factors involved here; I wouldn't rest until I was sure I wasn't in any danger. People die from CO poisoning every day. I've found a couple of websites that might help:|`|Q5Nn9Fxoaa	Then chances are your device is faulty.  I would call the manufacturer and demand a working replacement.  I have to ask though, are you using one that it attached to the ceiling?  Because you do realize those type of CO2 detectors are practically useless.  Even if it is located in the basement.  You should really use a CO2 detector that plugs in to a wall outlet and place it as close to the ground as you can get.   CO2 is heavier than the air we breathe, so by the time a room fills with CO2 (with a detector on the ceiling) anyone in the area would already be dead.  Just a warning.|`|zob4spgGaa	It's a CO, not CO2, detector. When it's going off remove it and take it outside. If it stops then there is some kind of problem.

Good Luck.|`|fPLv0QrSaa	Are you by chance charging a battery (like a car battery or backup battery for a sump pump) anywhere within the vicinity of the detector? That can set off a CO detector.
f05ea7b6535ace20ef9808478efbef84aa	It's inadvisable just to bury raw meat or fish under plants and expect it to compost naturally.Better make a proper compost heap,incorporating materials like fallen leaves,lawn mowings and other natural material.Use kitchen waste,like cabbage stalks,fruit peel,egg shells and tea bags if you wish.<br>  By building a compost heap in layers alternating coarse material like soft hedge clippings,straw and the like with vegetation,sprinkling with an accelerator such as lime useful compost will be ready in about six months.<br>  The ideal is to have two heaps,turning them occasionally and moving    rotted material to the top of the other pile.<br>  Keep the heap moist,not sodden it should heat up and actually steam.This process will break down the waste material into beneficial compost.|`|944iJNAdaa	I think maybe you're confusing a compost pile with using fish for fertilizer.  It's not a good idea to add fish to compost piles, because it attracts critters.  Blended fish puree makes a great plant fertilizer, though, and if it's dug under plants while they're being planted, it hopefully won't attract critters.  I've seen bears dig it up, though, and probably others would, too, if they smelled it, at least when it's fresh and pungent.  If you're a city gardener, those things probably don't have the same concerns.|`|vEsSIGfYaa	Yes, BUT fish must be well buried or the decomposition gasses will stink horribly, and be like a magnet for flies and other insects.|`|59c3b42b981e8e7cddf9e38ed4ba42b6aa	Don't! The decomposition process will only kill your plant. Materials that are not composted first when put under plant can harm plants seriously. It emits gasses that will suffocate your plants from roots up. What you can do though is bury it beside your plants, maybe a foot or so away. Hoping by the time your plants root reach it, it's ready for usage. Your peanuts, strawberries and watermelons won't grow their roots way down. Their roots systems spread out. So it's just make sense to bury your fish fertilizers beside them. I hope that answers your questions.|`|sSJ8zfebaa	can use any thing organic-just be careful,meats esp. fish will atract animals

t8kykME3aa	I understand your concern. I discovered high levels of radon in my house after I bought it. It wasn't a pleasant feeling building up while reading about the dangers. Here is what i did (this is the same answer I gave to another guy asking here). And yes I fully understand since I have small children:<br>  <br>  Quote starts here >>> <br>  <br>  I had a very similar problem with radon gas in my basement. It is indeed dangerous for your health. The concentration is not measured in percentages (that would be huge and lethal). It is measured in Bq/m3 or in pCi/l. You can find more information here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://radon-solution.com/" rel="nofollow">http://radon-solution.com/</a><br>  <br>  I investigated the problem and then I implemented a solution like the one described here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://handyowner.com/2008/08/17/installing-a-fan-based-radon-mitigation-system/" rel="nofollow">http://handyowner.com/2008/08/17/install...</a><br>  <br>  I did all the work myself and from 8 pCi/l now I got to 0.4 pCi/l. And all for about $350. The price includes<br>  <br>  - the fan<br>  - the electronic detector for continuous monitoring (I ordered them online from the first site)<br>  - the equipment rental from Home Depot (drill and bit to put a hole in the concrete slab in the basement)<br>  - pipes<br>  <br>  Read about it and act. If you don't feel comfortable doing the work yourself there are lots of contractors who can (for a price of course).<br>  <br>  <<< Quote ends here<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|6MkTB6pjaa	I believe that most houses will test positive for radon because  Radon is a colorless, odorless, naturally occurring, radioactive noble gas that is formed from the decay of radium. It is one of the heaviest substances that remains a gas under normal conditions and is considered to be a health hazard. Radon is a significant contaminant that affects indoor air quality worldwide. Radon levels fluctuate naturally. An initial test might not be an accurate assessment of a home's average radon level. Transient weather can affect short term measurements Therefore, a high result (over 4 pc/l) justifies repeating the test before undertaking more expensive abatement projects. Measurements between 4 and 10 pc/l warrant a long term radon test. Measurements over 10 pc/l warrant only another short term test so that abatement measures are not unduly delayed. Purchasers of real estate are advised to delay or decline a purchase if the seller has not successfully abated radon to 4 pc/l or less.|`|jtnQmAlRaa	Radon causes lung cancer and probably asthma and sixteen other respriatory illnesses.

1j1WE7gGaa	Colors like red or dark oranges are definitely not a good choice in a bedroom and in fact any dark colors will make your room look like a dungeon and it will be very hard to relax in such a space.You also mentioned that you want it to look more spacious,so you should focus on the cool side of the color wheel and look for colors like light greens and blues which are perfect for a bedroom.They will not only create the illusion of more space but will also create a very relaxing environment.However,if you prefer warmer colors (i.e reds,yellows,etc) then you should pick these colors in very light subtle hues and it should work just as well.For example,if you pick yellow then choose a very light pale yellow and don't worry about it being too boring because this is where accessories come to play their role.The important thing to remember is to always use light and toned down colors on the bedroom walls and depending on the mood you want to create,you can pick from either the cool or warm side of the palette.<br>  <br>  These are some good bedroom colors:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.housetohome.co.uk/imageBank/cache/b/blue-bedroom_e_9c53654d7f7c9c72667efde1daba6b35.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.housetohome.co.uk/imageBank/c...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.casacarole.com/_img/lrg.yellow.bedroom.5942.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.casacarole.com/_img/lrg.yello...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.3dm3.com/forum/attachments/f169/14135d1201625326-green-bedroom-green_bedroom-1-.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.3dm3.com/forum/attachments/f1...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.atlantahomesmag.com/images/2008/February2008/GreenBedCropped.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.atlantahomesmag.com/images/20...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dominomag.com/images/galleries/rooms/gasl02_tranquilbeds.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.dominomag.com/images/gallerie...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://8rd.org/upimgs/allimg/080729/1_0941316122.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://8rd.org/upimgs/allimg/080729/1_09...</a>|`|6WxsrIusaa	Light, cool colors feel spacious.

JFdcuYAkaa	It sounds like you have two thermostats and only one furnace. So witch ever thermostat is calling for heat it will turn the furnace on and heat the whole house. you might have automatic dampers witch controls where the heat goes In witch case thay are not working. but neather is your thermostat if the furnace never shuts off. First you need a thermostat  that will shut the furnace on and off. Then find out what the other thermostat is controling. If both thermostat control the same furnace it will never work right.If the downstairs is cold the furnace will stay on even if the upstairs is hot.|`|bff8176a9e09f8072e70e345d10362a8aa	call a tech if its turned off and showing emergancy heat when its off you have a burnt wire bad t-stat or a shorted wire could be too many thing to cover here call a tech good luck
vEsSIGfYaa	I have had this same issue before.<br>  <br>  For proper sewage drainage, most local plumbing codes require a downward slope [grade] of 1/4 inch per linear foot of run of the drain pipe.<br>  <br>  If this cannot be done, then a sewage pump must be installed in the drain system to force the sewage to the sewer main.<br>  <br>  Usually this is done by installing a "lift station" which consists of a small sump [tank] which is buried just outside of the foundation of the house, with a special pump in the sump.<br>  <br>  The pump must be the kind that is designed to grind up the solid matter in the sewage discharge from the house.<br>  <br>  The cost is usually slightly more than for ordinary gravity type sewage drains, and depends on where the job is located.  <br>  <br>  The largest part of the cost increase is for the special pump and the sump tank, but there is a slight increase in labor cost for the tank and pump installation.|`|3W18HDxxaa	its on top of the ground ? <br>   most sewers are 10 ft down <br>   and have a pipe running up to the house, <br>   or is it a septic tank ? <br>   too many variables need  better description <br>   & pictures if possible

Once you have primed with shellac, recoat with a high quality alkyd/oil primer such as Ben Moore's FreshStart UNDERBODY sandable primer. Then apply two coats of a high quality 100% acrylic finish paint. Good luck...this extra work will insure years of trouble free ceilings.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

iAM3gctWaa	Some of the outlets these days have a reset button on the actual outlet. If it isn′t that then go back to the main circuit breaker box and see if the particular breaker for that circuit needs to be reset. If it is one with a faulty ground fault interrupter then it should trip off as soon as you switch anything on. The cause may be the interrupter itself or something worse. In that case you had better get an electrician.|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	First check to see if you simply tripped a breaker on your breaker panel. If it is a GFI outlet the trip switch is on the outlet itself. These are usually installed near water sources like the bathroom. If that's all good Test the voltage (radio Shack or wal-mart has cheap meters) coming to the outlet. If you have power there, then you probably have an issue with the outlet itself.  They aren't hard to replace but if you have no experience with Electricity I would advise to let an Electrician do it for you.<br>  <br>  Edit: If you don't have power at the outlet then you probably have a bad breaker. Again they are not hard to replace but Call an electrician if needed.|`|bff8176a9e09f8072e70e345d10362a8aa	is it a gfi plug or on that circuit check that first|`|c401ebbf725fb9e420f4f0be6d5477ccaa	WARNING<br>  <br>  I clicked on ......allinfo.colors..... and found nothing worth reading.

vEsSIGfYaa	It sounds like your leaking valve is the bottom drain, and it can be replaced.  But before going to the trouble to replace the valve, MAKE SURE that it is the valve leaking, and NOT the water heater tank itself.  If the tank is leaking then the heater would have to be replaced. If only the valve is leaking, then it can be replaced.  <br>  <br>  You can check that by carefully examining the area around where the valve is installed into the heater tank.  If the water is coming from only the threaded hose bib then the valve itself is leaking.  But if the water is coming from the insulation above and around where the valve screws into the tank, then is is probable that the tank is leaking.<br>  <br>  To replace the drain valve requires that the cold water supply to the heater be fully turned off [usually there is a cut-off valve at the cold water inlet at the top of the heater]. <br>  <br>  For safety, before turning off the water supply it is necessary to turn off the heating power [electricity or gas supply] to the heater.  <br>  <br>  If there is no cold water cut-off valve at the heater inlet, then the water supply to the entire house will have to be shut off.  Sometimes there is a cut-off where the water service entrance line enters the house, and if not, then there is a valve just on the water main side of your water meter.<br>  <br>  Once the water is turned off you will have to drain ALL the water from the heater using the leaking drain valve.  Most, if not all, drain valves have a spigot which is threaded for use of a garden hose.  <br>  <br>  Connect a garden hose [which does NOT LEAK!] to the drain valve, route it to the yard outside, open the drain valve, AND then go to the nearest sink and open the HOT water to allow air into the hot water pipe system.  The water in the heater will not fully drain out if air is not allowed into the heater to replace the draining water.<br>  <br>  Once the heater is fully drained, then remove the hose, and remove the leaking valve and replace it using some Teflon pipe tape, or brush  some pipe thread sealant on the threads to prevent leakage where the valve screws into the heater.<br>  <br>  Be very gentle in screwing it in so as NOT to misalign ["cross-thread"] the threads or you can ruin the threads and thus the valve and possibly the tank. <br>  <br>  IF not cross-threaded you should be able to screw the new valve about 95% in by hand.<br>  <br>  Screw the valve in as far as possible by hand, and then use a wrench to finish the installation so that the spigot ends up pointing down.  This final tightening should not take more than a third to one full turn [at the most] with the wrench.<br>  <br>  Make sure the new valve is fully close, turn the water supply back on, and allow the water to fill the tank, AND continue to flow long enough to push all of the air out of the tank and lines until there is full flow of water at the open hot water valve at the sink or lavatory.<br>  <br>  When you're sure there are no leaks and the heater is full of water, then turn the heating power back on.  If a gas-fired heater, you'll need to relight the pilot, by carefully following the instructions on the label which is usually located near to the gas inlet and burner control valve on the heater.|`|zob4spgGaa	Go to a hardware store and get a metal hose bib cap|`|evItC2KQaa	The drip is probably caused by sediment in the valve.Do you periodically open the drain to flush it? You might try doing that. If you have not flushed it regularly and this does not work you are probably due for a new heater.Better to replace it before it springs a leak and causes real problems.

If you want, you can put a little bone meal in the bottom of the hole, but they grow well even without it--I planted about 100 tulips one year and they all did great.

iIeMgpBkaa	You'll have to attach the decking to something other than the patio itself.  Adhesives just won't work, but you don't need a big framework, either.  Here is an idea.  At the perimeter of your patio, drive 2" x 2" treated lumber into the ground at both sides of each corner.  If you have a square patio, that's 8 pieces for the corners.  Leave 1-1/2" above the elevation of the patio exposed.  Install intermediate 2" x2" at approximately 8' intervals or if your patio is smaller than 8' just put one in the center, again 1-1/2" above the patio.  Treated stair balusters will work great.  On the patio, lay treated 2" x 4" ( which actually measure 1-1/2" ) flat on the patio and nail through the 2" x 2" into the ends of those 2" x4".  You can then loose-lay intermediate flat 2" x 4" so that your maximum distance between the flat lumber pieces is 16".   Screw-attach your decking boards perpendicular over your flat framing; screwing into all boards.|`|fCF02V87aa	If its wood or portico type of decking---you need to make a frame out of pressure treated wood. The material needs to breathe --If you glue it or fasten it directly to the concrete--it will skrink or buckle.|`|AA10648704	Start by laying down a 2" layer of construction sand (not playground sand--it's too fine).  Scree (level) it with a 2 x 4, then compact it down (you can rent compactors). Make sure you allow for a little slope so  water won't collect at the foundation of the house.  Lay the pavers in the pattern you like, then get some patio edging, which is usually a metal "L" shape, where the bottom fits under the outside pavers.  Run it along the outside of the patio--this keeps the pavers in place.  Once you've finished this, take more sand and spread it over the patio, using a broom to get it into the cracks between the pavers.  That will help cement them in place.  Good luck!

You will be able to find this under www.behr.com, Explore Color, Behr Virtual Color Center - then select the Muted Yellow area.<br>  <br>  If you like to see the colors in person, go to any store that sells paint (Walmart, Lowe's, Home Depot, Sherwin, etc) and grab their color paint chips for the yellow or other colors that you like. Place the paint chips on the cabinets and see which makes you feel it gives you the look you are going for. It usually takes me a couple of days to make a color decision. Once you have decided, you can take that paint chip to any store and they can color match. Good luck.|`|7tXADC8qaa	Biege/Creams/Off-Whites/etc...<br>  Those are all neutral colors, and pastels are also easy to work with!  I would suggest popping a little more color in our you room my feel bland and boring.  Find your favorite piece of furniture or picture or bedding or what not and pull colors from that making your favorite piece in the room the focal point!  GOOD LUCK~|`|H7GtXRqGaa	magnolia with an accent wall behind your bed in something really bright
dGRq65eraa	I would only use dishwasher detergent to avoid an overflow of suds which can leak onto the floor. I have tips to make sure your dishes come out clean every time.|`|3W18HDxxaa	powdered laundry soap, <br>  or COMET  cleaning powder|`|7o3DMzXQaa	i wouldn't put anything else in there unless you would also like to clean everything around the dishwasher|`|pGI8Xcz1aa	Use white vinegar it will clean the dishes and clean the dish washer also and it won't hurt anything use as much vinegar as you do your dishwasher detergent.|`|czBW1Volaa	Use one or two drops of dish soap. Not too much or it will foam up and leak out of the dishwasher.

bxlYleZkaa	That one will be to drain the boiler itself. Lower ones will be in the system somewhere hidden in a corner where you cant get at them, purposely positioned by a plumber so you have to call him out.|`|96a318bea85eb2aa7d0b38b893875fb9aa	The drain tap you mention, is to drain the boiler only. There ia another one in the rad pipwork to drain the heating and pipework.|`|SttRtZ1Kaa	I shouldn't think so.<br>  You would drain from only "drain tap", and loosen the lowest connection and catch the leak.<br>  You can could purchase a "isolating/drain" valve from a plumbing supplies and change one "valve".|`|WTr44sTwaa	Oh I do like Vicky S.  The answer is No.  Don't be to sure that there will be a drain - remember, a plumber fitted it
83b9c11562d344b8e4284f71b30ebb2caa	Firstly, have hope, as Bird of Paradise plants can be pretty tough, as they have large, strong fleshy roots that help them recover from stressful situations.  I've had mine almost cut back to ground by freezing weather, and they've grown back strongly in the following summer.<br>  <br>  I'm concerned that yours has been overwatered,  and this could cause some infection to set in.  I'd recommend for now allowing it to dry out somewhat,  and to withdraw fertiliser, until it has stabilised.  Whilst they do benefit from being fertilised, they only need this during the growing season - but I'm not sure where you're located, eg. southern/northern hemisphere.  <br>  <br>  If its leaves are apparently dead, I'd remove most of this, as it could hold infective bacteria/fungal spores inside of it.  They do love lots of sunshine, but be wary of it getting extremes of heat and cooling cycles,  as this will add to the stress that it's been under.  Mine typically rest during the winter,  though I've had 2 new leaves on 1 plant this week, due to the spring sunshine, and warmer conditions.   It won't harm it to stabilise, if you let it dry out a little, before continuing its watering regime.  And don't get concerned if it sits and does nothing for a while, if it's still winter where you are.   Many shops that Home Depot and others sell have come from perfect growing conditions in a greenhouse, got shipped in trucks,  and then had another shock when they've landed at the retailers, all with less than ideal conditions.  Then they get bought by us, and put into our homes - many contrasting environments, all of which add stress to plants that love somewhat semi-tropical conditions.  Often our plants show the problems when they're in our homes, though these are the symptoms of earlier shock, whilst in transit - so don't blame yourself here.<br>  <br>  So, remove any decaying foliage, allow your plant growing medium to dry out a little, and reduce the frequency of watering, perhaps down to 10-14 days, until your plant is actively re-growing.  Once it is recovering, and spring is with you, then consider trying to start fertilising, - the watering you've done in the meantime will help to flush out salts that can build up, after the use of artificial fertilisers.  <br>  <br>  Otherwise,  you could ask Home Depot if they could swap it, if they still have some in stock.  In San Diego, and similar places, they carry these plants for much of the year.  Just let them know that it has not been great from the start - some staff may be really helpful, but I think there's every chance that your plant will recover, as long as its roots are not decayed.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Good luck!  Rob|`|WcudvcLxaa	yellow usually means too much water<br>  also, they come from hot places<br>  i dont know the temp. where you live but this could be the cause<br>  <br>  good luck!
vbOfxrSsaa	First of all, my condolences.  So sorry for your loss.<br>  <br>  Second, don't listen to the other poster.  There's nothing wrong with celebrating your son's life, the time you were able to spend with him.  <br>  <br>  Third, I haven't seen one of these.  Have you tried ebay?  <br>  <br>  So sorry, again.|`|hWd50Lk8aa	Sorry about the loss.<br>  <br>  Check with your cemetery first.<br>  <br>  Very few cemeteries here (Dallas, TX) will allow anything other than flowers to be placed on the grave. Their reasoning, and correctly so, is that one day all of us will be gone and there will not be any family members willing to maintain the items left behind.  One can only imagine after 5 years what type of stuff would collect or break down when exposed to nature.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|YRrGv82Zaa	My idea is to contact your locale flag/banner shop,makers.<br>  They may have a on site artist who can reverse engineer or have a catalog that holds this special piece. <br>  <br>  Another is perhaps a locale artist would be willing to take on the job.<br>  <br>  <br>  What a nice piece to have, wishing the best on your search.<br>  others who have used a fun bee...<br>  <a href="http://adriankinloch.smugmug.com/gallery/2230400_X45yb/22/122758657_edEHc#122758657_edEHc" rel="nofollow">http://adriankinloch.smugmug.com/gallery...</a>|`|dXrHoLMCaa	<a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/Whirligig-Bee_W0QQitemZ150326873484QQcmdZViewItemQQptZOutdoor_Decor?hash=item150326873484&_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&_trkparms=72%3A1205%7C66%3A2%7C65%3A12%7C39%3A1%7C240%3A1318%7C301%3A0%7C293%3A1%7C294%3A50" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/Whirligig-Bee_W0QQit...</a><br>  <br>  does it have to be that one?....

kqE6B7dNaa	some towns have spring and fall clean ups where you can put just about anything out to the curb for pickup. Do you have a landfill or transfer station nearby? If you have a truck or access to a truck you could take your trash to your local dump or transfer station for a lot cheaper than the cost for dumpster rental|`|8HDQMkSBaa	Since none of us know where you are....we can really give an amount....Most people would call local trash removal in the area for rates.....Why you chose here is beyond me....|`|jtnQmAlRaa	See if your town or city has special pick ups.  Then you don't have to pay anything.   Or you could start the clean up and put stuff in your trash every week and eliminate a big pick up.   You can also look in the yellow pages for garbage pick up companies.  They do one time pick ups.  If you really really want a dumpster, they are also in the yellow pages under dumpters, and garbage companies.|`|kfvgkZ1saa	You not only have to consider the time rented on the dumpster (around $50 a week or so), but there is often a weight calculation that is involved.  So if you are filling the dumpster with say, wood and 'lighter' materials, you will pay less than if you are throwing chunks of concrete away.  The roll-off company will have a charge by the ton they should quote you.  It will be impossible to calculate without knowing those things, but that should get you started....|`|6bZXa0Reaa	Home Depot has cheap dumster rentals
3W18HDxxaa	the timer motor is shot, you can replace it <br>   look for appliance repair parts in the yellow pages|`|pjGueC4xaa	Get some electrical contact cleaner (hardware store), pull off the cycle knob, and spray the knob stem with the stuff.  Then put the knob back on, and work the dial (move it back and forth) a few times.<br>  <br>  The dial is connected to a rheostat that takes your washer through each cycle.  Sometimes it gets dirty and does not make proper contact.<br>  <br>  Repeat the process if it doesn't work the first time.
