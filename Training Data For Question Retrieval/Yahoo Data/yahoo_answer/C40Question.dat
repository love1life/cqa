I'm not an Obama supporter but I'm shocked that people are still saying he was not an American born citizen but i'm not going to jump on that band wagon until he decides to sign the release forms releasing his personal information from schools he attended.

I was recently offered to go to OCS training with the Marines. I was also told that its a non-commitment program, and I can leave or accept the commission upon hypothetical completion.      I really don't want to be in the military, but I want to try out OCS for myself, just out of curiosity and because I feel it is something I need to get familiar with.      I understand that many of you, with reasonable disdain, will tell me that I shouldn't even do this because I'll be wasting the Marines' time and resources, but is it worth going? Are there people out there who did the exact same thing I am asking about?      I also assume that when I get there, quitting and DOR-ing wont be as easy as it seems to me now, due to all the psychological pressure that will be upon me.      Thank you everyone for your time.

Even though the stimulus is based upon the lessons learned from the first great depression, Republicans are closed off to ANY idea that comes from a democrat.       Is it pointless to seek their help since it is impossible to ask them to what best for the nation rather than whats best for their party?

20090222215307AAkLaFR	Politics & Government;International Organizations	Should the United Nations have a real standing security force?	And no, don't tell me the UN already has a peacekeeping force. I'm talking about a military force actually able to enforce any decisions made by the United Nations. A force strong enough to see any security policies carried out, strong enough to stand against a national army, with equal numbers of members from each of its member-states (which would probably only equal a few thousand soldiers from each nation), but not so strong that a coalition of nations couldn't stand against it in case of corruption or the army going "rogue". I'm sure the UN could find a way to create a perfectly balanced military force that is strong yet not almighty. Such a force could be used to end regional conflicts like the Darfur Genocide without involvement from regular nations like the US.      I know many people would be opposed to this idea, but the UN is not truly effective unless it can be sure its policies will be enforced in every country, from the weakest and poorest to the richest and strongest (yes that includes the US). Its current peacekeeping force is more like the peace corps than a real army.

20090222204939AA2tfZ1	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	How do you deal with someone who has a "victim complex"?	My ex boyfriend and I are involved in a custody battle, I am trying to be fair and even more so. Unfortunately whenever we go to court or involve the lawyers where it would be a chance for him to voice his opinion he repeatedly says that I am constantly trying to stop him from seeing my one year old daughter and never talk to him. It is so frustrating because I would just like to get this whole thing over with and forget about the past. He has court ordered visitation every other weekend but does not call and ask for anything more. When he had supervised visitation, he wanted to schedule a visitation but I was working that day and asked if we could do it the next day or whatever works for him. From then on he has said I canceled his one and only visitation, except that would have been number 3 or 4.       Since we have broken up he has burned my art portfolio, tried to run me off the road with my daughter (3 months old at the time), and two other friends in the car off the road. Kept all (minus a couple Walmart bags full) of my personal possessions including my daughters crib, which was my sisters & cousins before hers. My grandfathers coin collection passed on from my great aunt, great grandmothers jewelry, and numerous other things.       I have tried repeatedly to get along with him for the sake of our daughter, but I believe he wants revenge because I broke up with him. I have explained this to him and he agrees, but will turn around and say something completely different in the courts.      Is there anything I can do to convince him that we need to put the past behind us and just move on? Or do I have to deal with his victimizing for 18 years, or until he grows up? (I am 20 he is 22) Is anyone in this same situation that might be able to give me some pointers?       Thank you.

She has the tendency of stealing, she is currently serving time for stealing out of K-Mart.      So my question is she currently stole a Blackberry from me and pawned it, I have the pawn ticket with her name and the date she pawned it.      I have the box in which the Blackberry came in which happens to have the ESN numbers that are used to activate the phone.      I don't have a receipt of purchase but I'm sure Sprint can look it up and print one out and Show when I paid for the phone and which Credit Card I used, I also have the statement with the 251 dollars that I paid for it.       Now i don't care about pressing charges I just want my Property back without having to pay the pawn shop.   If I go to the police station place this report what are the chances they'll give me my property back? or will they keep it as evidence?

Then explain to me how he managed to "get around" those other 2 branches, you know the "checks and balances" who apparently have no blame at all. Holy crap, I just realized, we already shrank the government, apparently there are several hundred congressmen in DC that have no role in our gov, I guess that would make them irrelevant.

Today I asked him for it back, and he informed me that he sold it to someone out of this state. I am obviously going to email him and inform him that I need 1600 dollars, but if he refuses, is small claims court the next step? Also, would this be an easy thing to win in small claims court, and could I also ask for more for the hassle and still have a strong case? Can the judge only require part of the money (So if I filed a case for 2000, could he say 1500, or is it 2000 or dismissed?)      One more thing. I found out it would cost 175 to file the claim. Can I ask for this money as well?      Thanks!

Would you agree (and this is just my opinion)  that RJ Reynolds has his crosshairs focused exclusively on teens with these?      Yeah they are pretty neat. But think, everyone is always going to crush the bead and smoke menthol (Whats the fun if you don't?) so any smart adult would see it as pointless and just buy regular menthols so you don't have to go through an extra chore just to get menthol pleasure. I think it is a little too obvious that Camel is targetting teens. I know they have always done it but this one kind of crosses the line by releasing a high tech ciggarette that would only appeal to a teenager or an easily entertained adult who fancies a set of jingly keys. It's a little TOO obvious now.      and Camel Snus. I have always loved Snus (not just Camel) but I don't think the motives for it were just to add Snus to the line but because of the convenience it offers to teenagers. For one, you don't need to spit so you can just gut it and the pouch is slim and easy to hide, AND it doesn't smell like chew so it can be mistaken for gum. When I first heard this I thought one thing...Perfect for school! No spitting, easy to swallow, no bulge and no smell.      Don't mistake me for an activist or an anti-tobacco extremist, I do Snus in school and I was an underage smoker for 2 years. I'm just curious if i'm the only one who thought it was a little far.      What do you think?   .

20090222221903AA84WFw	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	How do i find the best lawyer for the suit i want to bring against a doctor?	Doctor did surgery on my wife. 2 week after the surgery the patch in her head which covered and sealed her brain in her skull after a piece of skull was removed to give her brain room. So that the swelling would go down in her head. Broke and started to leak brain fluid. The brain fluid which started to accumulate in her neck and upper back and against her spine continued. The surgeon which was my wife doctor continued to blow her off. This guy Bed side manners are horrible. Or you can say follow up care. My wife needed a immediate surgery then to correct the problem. But the doctor kept ignoring her and never returned her calls. We hade to go through other doctors to get this guy to take my wife problem seriously. Finally, he did a second surgury to fix the patch. More than 2 months later after it started to leak brain fulid. My wife then spent another painful week in the hospital recovering while they also drained the fuild that had built up in the neck and back while the surgen had ignored her. After that less then another month later my wife went to the hospital again in terrible pain. By the way almost this whole time she never had pain meds other than the days in the hospital. After my wife got to the hospital they diagnois her with chemical menagitis of the brain. --It where the chemicals in the brain are off so badly that the bodys immumune system attacks the brain. At least that as much of it as i understand. While in the hospital the doctors there tryed to contact my wife's doctor the surgen who is the speacialist and who had done my wife's two surgury's But, he never retured there calls at first. Then after they where finally able to reach him days later(and by the way At this time my wife in in dire need -{Emergency stituation) If you understand life threating. He said he would not come to the hospital that's what the other dotors told us. They had to call a dotor in Another state to know how to treat my wife because what she had was rare and the dotors there did not know how to treat it. And of course, Our surgen -or doctor blew us off again because he did not want to deal with it. Leaving my wife to die. Thank God the dotors at the hospital despite not Knowing what to do Called and found sombody to tell them what to do so that they at least could help my wife Anyways the surgen that my wife had in the very begining never mentioned that chanses of getting chemical menagitis were high from the very begining and the possiblity of getting it were higher after a second surgey. Which is what my wife had the last time she went to the hospital in a ambulance. Never said what to look out for and what to do He never cared. And that was clear when he did not want to come to the hospital and take care of his patient my wife. Anyways everbody even other doctors's say i should sue him. So i know that i can open up the phone book and just start calling lawyers and asking questions. But i know that all of them that handle cases like this will tell me that they can do a good job. because they want the biz. But, how do i track how well a lawyer does--like past history with cases like this law suit would be. How do i find a laywer that will handle this law suit and do it well. And would do me honest and fair. Also how much should they get paid. Even if they don't make money unless they win for me.

I was talking to a friend of mine the other day, he is a self made millionaire who HAD $10,000,000.00 invested in the markets.  I asked him what he was doing with his money and he said, "I have been pulling it out of the Markets".  I asked him why and he said, "Why should I take all the risks to make money when Obama and the Democrats are just going to take it."        What he basically told me is he intends to sit out Obama's Presidency and that he can afford to, so he is voting with his dollars.      Is my friend an anomaly? Or is he a representation of a much larger group of folks?      Let's not do the typical thing and accuse me of lying...blah....blah....blah.

They have cheaper (if not free) post-secondary education, cheaper oil and the list goes on. Yes socialism is devastating as pursued by the right wing agenda. Yes I am a liberal, but do share some conservative view points. However no form of government is perfect, which includes democracy, give someone too much freedom and their find a way to abuse it and harm everyone around them. I don't think I'm a socialist nor do I endorse it, but I do not fear it since socialism in other developed countries worked out pretty well.

If it is Obama that is finding them....why is he letting the Republicans nickle and dime him to death like this?  He had such a well organized campaign, why is he not countering their PR offensive? Is it because he's trying to be bipartisian?      And if so...is being bipartisian really such a good idea?

If not then why do many people continue to support Government involvement in organizations and institutions that can be run more efficiently by private business. For example there are many people who support Social Medicine, but why put this institution in the hands of a huge inefficient bloated bureaucracy. The same could even be said for public schools. In my experience private business is infinitely better at running organizations and institutions efficiently, and developing creative solutions to systemic problem. Why not leverage this ability by privatizing more Government organizations and institutions.

Alitalia, la condizione della Cai   Non accollateci il prestito ponte   Tra le condizioni irrinunciabili dell'offerta Cai per Alitalia ce n'è una che forse rappresenta meglio le reali preoccupazioni di Colaninno e soci. L'offerta di Cai, infatti (che è irrevocabile fino al 30 novembre) è valida solo se il governo italiano riuscirà a ottenere provvedimenti da parte della Commissione europea con cui si attesti che eventuali aiuti di Stato, ai sensi dell'art. 87 e seguenti del Trattato CE, istituiti a beneficio del Gruppo AZ prima della stipula del contratto, non comportino a carico dell'Acquirente alcun obbligo di restituzione.

20081103063154AAQ73kg	Politics & Government;Immigration	Why is it in Britain that immigrants seem to be treated like royalty, and Brits seem to be treated like dirt?	It's not a rant, but I am wondering why this is. Anyone pro-immigrant who wants to say anything about this, all I will say is, I dont follow this media hype. I see what happens around me with my own eyes.      In 2004, when I was 17, I worked after school as a school cleaner. Two Brazilian men were employed and soon after working there, they attempted to try it on with me, making crude comments and trying to touch me up. When I reported it to my boss, he shrugged it off, hinting at racism. I wasnt! The time came when the fat Brazilian git tried to get his hand in my knickers, and I ran off and told the head teacher. She was repulsed, and they HAD to go. Then they accused me of racism, and were going to take me to court for defamation of character. It put me under so much stress that I was signed off by my GP with stress for two weeks and failed my exams at school. I still see these walking shites going about there business and have been told they assaulted other women. Authorities eg Police did nothing, yet when a British guy tried it on with a woman in a local store a year later, he was arrested. Where's the sense in that?      Same applies for most things. Just managed to get rid of a horrid obnoxious trouble making family of Poles causing disturbances at all hours. Council got involved... and did nothing. Year prior to them moving there, a lady in my boyfriends flat block threw a party from 10pm-3am in the morning. She is now blacklisted.      And why is it, that, I happen to be a hardworking, honest taxpayer, same applies to my Mum. Am on no form whatsoever of benefits, and yet we live in shite conditions, pretty much on the breadline. Whilst these horrid Afghans got a 1.2 million pound house in England, when they have done **** all to contribute.      Explain please. Thank you.       P.S, seeing as this is a forum, I dont expect abusive or insulting answers. I have already had a tirade of abuse from a gentleman who will go unnamed via email.

20081112074820AAwiNnU	Politics & Government;Military	My parents are not understanding of my wanting to join the Navy...?	I understand that the world sucks right now and that there is two wars going on. But If I join I will be going in for nursing. They even have something called the Nurse Corps.       I am looking into the Navy because it has always been in the back of my mind. I am tired of letting things hold me back from the things I've always wanted to do, like see the world how it really is and experience as much as I can. I will also get education and the skills I need for a career in nursing and the Navy even has hospital ships that I can work on. I  will receive money for college, decent pay and will also have nursing school paid for. I do not like traditional classroom learning and I learn my best with hands on. I need an attitude adjustment as well, Lil.       Yes, the thought of boot camp scares me, but I can get my butt in proper shape since I cannot even do much besides enlist until May 09.      My biggest thing is to see how the world truly is and experience it. I love ships, the ocean and going places and helping people.       My parents are completely unsupportive and say I can do all of this here in Ohio...I cannot afford to travel or go to school full time and focus 100% on my studies because I have to work full time for health insurance and to support my self because I enjoy living on my own. They want me to move back home and such...which I do not want to do.       I feel lost, confused and don't know who I am. My mom even says the military is good for people like that. I need direction and to be independent. I've let to much get me down and now I want to better myslef and look into my future and life.       I'll be  20 in thee weeks and am compleatly unhappy with almost every part of my life. I want to change and get away and better myself.      How can I get my parents to be supportive. Or should I just go and enlist. I've explained all of the above to them and they still don't understand.

20081106104822AA41ufK	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Third degree retail fraud in Michigan?	The other day, I was at the mall with my young son.  He had grabbed a ring off the counter (it was $5) and I didn't notice it.  He told me that he had to go to the bathroom and so I hurried out of the store since the food court was the nearest restroom that I knew of.  I do not go to that mall often and we live overseas with the military so I didn't want to wander around looking for a restroom.        My son was my main priority and just getting him to the bathroom so he didn't wet all over himself and the stroller.      After I left, someone from Loss Prevention came and told me that I had something in my stroller that was unpaid for.  I realized it was the ring which had slipped down the side of my son's body.      I apologized and explained that I did not realize he had it and that it was not my intent to take anything without paying for it.  I told him how we are potty training and that my son often waits for the last minute to tell us thus almost wetting himself.      None the less, he told me he would have to charge me with Retail Fraud in the Third Degree.   He set up a court date for me as well.      I am unsure if I should plead Guilty or Non Guilty as yes, it was taken even though it was not my intent.        My questions are will the judge allow me to explain mysefl?  Do I need to get a lawyer?        I am a prior police officer with the Army and my husband is currently stationed overseas.  We were just back here visiting my family and we are set to leave to fly back to our base in Japan the 15th of December.      I can not belive the LPO was not more understanding.  I have no record whatsover and in fact, I have a Top Secret Clearance.  I was hoping to work for DOD soon but with this on my record, I'm afraid that might not happen.      The LPO told me that if I plead guilty, it will be over quicker however, I feel that I truly didn't intend for anything like this to happen...      Thank you.

I am applying for temporary disability in NJ because I am unable to work due to chronic fatigue, and other debilitating symptoms.  I have 2 doctors who can write me off, but I'm not sure which one to use.  One is an endocrinologist, and the other is an MD who would be considered an alternative doctor.  The alternative doctor does standard tests and diagnoses, but tends to use natural things before medication, unless medication is necessary.  The reason why I'm planning to use the alternative doctor is that I have been seeing her for almost 2 years, whereas the endocrinologist i have seen for 2 months.  I am just worried the state may use any reason to deny my application.  I have spoken to 3 lawyers and I get conflicting answers.  One didnt know, the other said it would be better with 2 doctors, the third said one doctor is better, and if its an alternative doctor it doesnt matter as long as a proper diagnosis was performed.  Again does it matter if the doctor is an alternative doctor?

It says, based on filing status, we're receiving $600, but I thought it was 600 for individuals and 1200 for married couples, in addition to $300 per child...?      Thanks, any help here would be good.

My Mom is always forcing me to go places with her like to the store, events, church and when I say no she always threatens to call the police since I won't listen to her. So basically I am in my room doing homework or something and she comes in saying, "(Name), I need to return this coat I bought for you, but it was too big. Come with me so we can buy new clothes for you." I say, "No, that's ok. I don't want any new clothes." And she says, "Well, I told you yesterday that we were going so put on your clothes and hurry up." I say, "But you didn't ask me if I wanted to come, you just told me too yesterday and I didn't answer." And she says, "Well, you're going anyway. When I come back in this room you better be dressed." And this goes on and on and she keeps coming back in my room saying, "Why aren't you dressed!?!?!" And I keep saying, "I don't want to go." And she says, "If you don't get out this house I'm gonna call the police." Let's say she actually called the police on of these days and they came. What exactly would they do? Be real with me please.

Because Classical Liberalism (Jefferson Etc.) has nothing to do with present-day American Liberalism.    So does anybody have a more fitting word to describe American liberal policies without using the word liberal??      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_l...    "Classical liberalism (also known to be associated with traditional liberalism[1], laissez-faire liberalism[2], market liberalism[3] or, outside the United States and Britain, sometimes simply liberalism) is a doctrine stressing individual freedom and limited government. This includes the importance of human rationality, individual property rights, natural rights, the protection of civil liberties, individual freedom from restraint, equality under the law, constitutional limitation of government, free markets, and a gold standard to place fiscal constraints on government[4] as exemplified in the writings of John Locke, Adam Smith, David Hume, David Ricardo, Voltaire, Montesquieu and others. As such, it is the fusion of economic liberalism with political liberalism of the late 18th and 19th centuries.[2] The "normative core" of classical liberalism is the idea that laissez-faire economics will bring about a spontaneous order or invisible hand that benefits the society,[5] though it does not necessarily oppose the state's provision of some basic public goods with what constitutes public goods being seen as very limited.[6] The qualification classical was applied retroactively to distinguish it from more recent, 20th-century conceptions of liberalism and its related movements, such as social liberalism[7] Classical liberals are suspicious of all but the most minimal government[8] and object to the welfare state[9]."

I have seen in 96', i think the number was close to 1,050,000 Felony Convictions, and also in 2002, around the same number.      But no where can i seem to find a TOTAL number. I have always wondered about it, since in most states, felons can't vote, and how much that impacts our political scene.      Also, i think its quite easy for people to get hit with a felony and wonder if there is more people in our communities that are convicted felons, even though they may have done something 20-30yrs ago. In most cases i would assume that these people have lead eventful lives, raised familes, ect... and perhaps how people view felons should be changed.

The attorney representing a bank owned condo moved into the condo right after the owner moved out.  His x-wife is the real estate agent on record and she told us he is living their for free (the bank has no idea).  Is this legal, and isn't he breaking some kind of trespassing laws?     The condo board is furious with him.

If being racist is depicting people racially, would it make one racist for openly criticizing someone's physical features? For example, what happens if someone makes fun of Obama's lips or ears? Would that be racist? Would it be in comparison of what the National socialists were teaching children about the Jew's facial features?      What is your definition of racism?
20090222162427AAUvXY2	Politics & Government;Military	Prior Service ARMY for 3yrs 7 months 11B joining Navy reserves?	I got out of Army 11 months ago.  I was going to join the Air Force reserves; but, the Air Force reserves only had supply, Fire Fighter, MP.  I did not want to do these jobs the AFR had, so I decided to join the Navy reserves.  Now I am waiting for the paper work to go threw to get into the Navy reserves.  I had no problems at all in the ARMY and I am a 1. The Navy reserve recruiter said I could be a Builder and get a $20,000 bonus or AME and get a $10,000 bonus.  I picked the builder.  Mostly I picked the builder because of the bonus, but wanted to learn contruction, ect.The recruiter said I get $10,000 at my first drill weekend, than $7500 after A school is completed.  My recruited told me the $20,000 bonus and everything else will be in writing.  This week sometime I sign the paper work and get in the Navy reserves.  I will for sure NOT sign anything unless its in writing and I see with my own eyes.  My question is.?  What is it like being a Builder in the Navy reserves?  How does the $20,000 bonus work?  What's A school like and what do you do, training, ect?  How long is A school?  How many years can I sign up for? Ect?  Ect?
