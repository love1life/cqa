NbgxNAYZaa	You will need primer or plan on using several coats of paint. You want either a gloss or a semi gloss finish. They are more durable than flat. Paint a thin coat, then sand lightly after it is dry then paint another coat. Until you have the surface you want. Take your time and do a good job.|`|Lg4cmiL5aa	You want to sand very well to make sure the paint is not peeling, otherwise you might as well strip first. Then prime and use whatever sheen you want.

Dse8LFKfaa	Keep it moist- Even water it if you have to.<br>  Add a mix of kitchen waste ( vegetable peels, not fats or meats)<br>  and yard waste, like leaves and clippings. <br>  Just make a pile in a corner of the garden or yard or you can get fancy and build an enclosure with wire, or fencing.<br>  Add dirt to this because the dirt has some of the good bacteria that break down the waste into usable nutrients by plants a veggies.<br>  Maybe once or twice a week , depending on your location turn it with a shovel or garden fork. This will bring more oxygen in and help it along-<br>  OR do nothing and it will just take longer.<br>  Eventually it will break down and yield rich dark compost that will be very good for anything that grows. <br>  If it gets smelly (like garbage) then something is out of balance and you probably need to add more earth, or green waste ,and give it a good turn. You dont need commercial fertilizer if you can make enough compost ( even ask your neighbors if you can have their grass clippings) good luck.
AA12094894	Your choice of glue depends on the material and the size / type of damage. If it's a split / crack that has clean sharp edges, then any ordinary superglue will do the job. This type of glue works by the absence of air. So the harder you push it together the harder it will stick. If the damage is not a clean sharp break you may need to use an epoxy resin type glue. These usually come in two tubes that you mix together. This can be stronger but is usually more difficult to apply and can be messy. Either type, done properly could extend the life of your seat.|`|MQJ8w56Qaa	I agree, replace the seat.|`|pjGueC4xaa	Gorilla glue for sure|`|F5PUol8vaa	Epoxy will repair it.

First have you tried adjusting the high speed jet?  Locate the the jet and with the engine running full speed turn the screw out a quarter turn and see if that helps if not turn it in a bit until it runs smooth.  If this doesn't work you can check the fuel filter.  It is unually in the gas tank on the end of the supply hose.  You can fish it out with a piece of wire with a hook on the end.  If it is dirty replace it.  The next thing is to rebuild the carburetor.  You can get a rebuild kit for about $15.00 and it is not too hard of a job.  The carburetor has diaphrams in it and they go bad over time.

You can however root the stems of the plant and create new plants. You would find the end of a stem where all the leaves are sprouting go back about three inches and cut. I take all leaves off the cutting except the very top ones dip in some rooting powder ( you can get from Wal-mart or garden center). And put in soil keep wet till you start seeing new growth. I do alot of rooting without the rooting powder but thats like insurance. You might be able to just put the cuttings in water and wait till roots form and then plant. you can get lots of cuttings from one plant.

6711a1d84892dbba34b6771f8ea24977aa	OK.... lights and outlets should be on separate circuits. It's not likely that ALL the outlets in your brothers room and yours are on the same breaker. most electricians won't wire a house that way to avoid problems like yours. sometimes outlets on a common wall will be piggy-backed.<br>  if you and your brother have all your gear plugged into outlets on a common or shared wall, this could be the problem. try moving your computer and anything else that might use alot of juice to the opposite wall and see if that helps. <br>   If this problem persists, call the builder and they should send someone out to deal with it. It could be just a loose connection in an outlet or in the breaker panel.<br>  <br>         good luck with this.....Peace|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Is that a 'brand new house' with AFCI breakers.<br>  A new house should have adequate circuits to run what you <br>  mention, but it sounds like you might have a lot of extension <br>  cords, and any small arc fault in them will trip an AFCI.<br>  They are also sometime 'fooled' by the characteristics of some <br>  solid state power supplies, (like the cheap ones in X-Boxes).|`|k7hBT7MGaa	The cost of adding another circuit depends on where you want the circuit, and the design and construction of the house.  The electrician would want to be able to find a route for the new cable that minimizes the need to tear into walls.  He/she would try to plan a route that uses the basement, crawl space or attic space to get to where the power is wanted.  In some cases, he/she might want to install conduit on the surface of walls or ceilings.  Call an electrician and get an estimate.<br>  <br>  In some cases, the existing wires can be pulled out, and a new cable with more capacity can be pulled in.  However, this isn't an option where the cables have been stapled to the studs inside walls, or where staples inside walls are required in new circuits. <br>  <br>  Here is something you can try before calling an electrician.  You will need your parents' cooperation. <br>  <br>  Unplug everything in your house.  Switch off all the circuit breakers except the "main".*  Turn on the first circuit breaker.  Test the different outlets in your room and your brother's room by plugging in an incandescent lamp, radio, or other device. When the lamp (or whatever) verifies that it is a live outlet, make a note of the one circuit breaker that was on.  Do this with the other rooms, too.  Turn off that circuit breaker, and turn on the next one.  Repeat until all the outlets and circuit breakers are tested. This way, you can build a "map" of what outlet is on which circuit breaker. <br>  <br>  Instead, you could switch the circuit breakers on and off until you find the ones that power the plugged in lamps.  Then, move the lamps to untested outlets and repeat. <br>  <br>  Based on the map you created, rearrange the devices to spread out the load. <br>  <br>  * You can leave breakers for "dedicated" circuits (range, furnace, etc.) on.|`|1TpNDufAaa	even a 15 amp breaker should not be tripping with the items you mentioned.

944iJNAdaa	Clay naturally settles to the bottom of a pond, and it doesn't need tamped - clay consists of particles that bind tightly together when wet.  Bentonite clay is said to be the best for this, you can buy it someplaces.  I bet you find rubber liners are no more expensive than clay unless you have your own clay onsite, though, and rubber liners are said to be a more certain way to seal a pond.<br>  <br>  I've known people that built small ponds with several layers of black plastic.

The cheapest gypsum to be found is at home building, or commercial construction sites when they throw out the scrap pieces of sheetrock.  Sheetrock products are made from gypsum, with paper attached to both sides.  Just throw it on the bottom of the pond, don't worry about the paper.  It will get wet, and just turn to slick gray mud.  Just ask the foreman at the job site if you can have it.  They will tell you to just help yourself, and will tell you when they will have more for you to haul off.|`|82de24f031d159553cd0cc9b4cfe54a2aa	We have a pond, it's pretty large and we were losing water, so we used drilling mud and poured the powder in the area where the leak was believed to be.

Im using 11W CFL's with a 600Lm rating (Lm rating should be on the box), and im using 4 of them, giving me 2400Lm. when the plant is fully established, im going to use more powerful bulbs to get me to 4000Lm. dont forget to line the dog house in foil to optimise available light. turn the lights on for 18 hours a day during growing.<br>  When you are ready to flower the plant, use even  more powerful bulbs (6000Lm) but only switch them on for 12hours a day. dont put the bulbs too close to the plant, or it will fry.<br>  <br>  Go on you tube, theres a guy called mr. green. watch his tutorials. his set ups are elaborate, but you get quite good info.

AA11402337	Hello there  if you have the space in a wall you can use the house wall<br>  like the back side , if you don′t want make too much job with a frame you can screw direct to the home wall 2 posts check that this are straight  then at the same distance put 2 more in front  you can use the corners for  make the opening door  more small the front posts need a little of excavation (you need use treated wood for this ) then cut the sides at same size you need make  a cut in the part that going attached to the house wall more high  and in front more small remember at same size, then you can cut the floor of the dog′s home   and after the roof with 3" in the sides and the front  more long than the walls and you can use a piece of old carpet inside for make warm the house you can use in the interior wall too your dog appreciate it! for the roof you can use some shingles or some kind of  waterproof system in some places like Owe′s or home depot  you can find some fiber board this material is more resistant than plywood|`|UQWusO1waa	build an" A frame " thats the easiest. because there is no roof to leak. just 2 walls, the front and back.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=build%20a%20frame%20dog%20house">http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=build%2...</a>|`|944iJNAdaa	You can't just put screws into plywood, at least on the edges, or they'll strip out.

Doghouses are made just a little bit bigger than the dog, so their body heat can warm the interior.<br>  <br>  If you can install a dog door and have the place, I think it might be easier to house a dog in an outbuilding that's already there, too.<br>  <br>  I'm getting the idea your dog might not like this move, I hope this doesn't bring on behavioral problems.

RzHzWootaa	Look at the color Devonshire. I used this in my kitchen on the walls, trim was snow white and I have chrome and black accents with apple red as my kitchen is done in apples. Looks really good. It is out of the Khaki family and I got it at Lowe's.|`|Lg4cmiL5aa	I suppose the question here is whether or not to do this? I would say of course, just make sure your paint is in the same hues, or accents the fireplace. I have similar blends in my family room and I fauxed my fireplace as well.I went with just a slightly more coffee latte brown. Looks great with the whites and blacks.|`|0nqf9tmfaa	We painted the fireplace too. Looks awesome.|`|l9xnybUMaa	Sweet!

1b6c195ba207883a224264d44c013600aa	I've had good luck with the 'drain king', which is a water pressure clog clearing bulb that connects to a garden hose.  You connect the bulb to your hose and feed it down the pipe to the clog.  When you fill the hose with water from a tap, the bulb expands and seals the pipe directing the water towards the obstruction.  <br>  <br>  If your shower is backing up, the plug is in the 3" or 4" diameter pipe below your toilet, and also below the smaller pipe that connects from your shower drain to the larger drain pipe. You can't feed a hose or drain snake through the water trap in your toilet fixture to the pipe.  You can try to access this clog from a roof vent pipe above this toilet if this is a top floor or one story home.  If you can't clear it from there, you will have to unbolt the toilet and access the pipe at the floor.  You'll also need a new 'waxie' toilet seal and probably new brass nuts and toilet anchor bolts to re-install the toilet when your done.|`|vP4S6IZTaa	If it is coming into the tub you have a deeper clog than the toilet. You might be better off calling a plumber. Otherwise, you can pull the toilet from the floor and run it directly into the pipe. Then again, it still may not be long enough to reach the clog. Good luck...

RQ7utEMBaa	New Electric code requires any modifications made to a structure to require the type of smoke detectors that are all connected together in the structure. You need to find out if this is that type. It sounds like it is not. It seems that the unit is old and probably full of contaminates, thus meaning you don't need much to push it past it's level to go off. The best option for you is going to be replacing it. They are really inexpensive nowadays. Maybe 20 bucks at Home depot.|`|YuWLcExJaa	1. Clean your oven.<br>  <br>  2. On a serious note. Do your smoke alarms have a carbon monoxide alarm built in ?

If so, the problem could be what you've used to clean.  We recently looked at a shower where the tile had been refinished.  The work was done just before the home sold and the new homeowners didn't know.  The cleaner did a real job on the epoxy.  There were also footprints on the shower pan tile where it was sticky and everything just stuck to it.  Ask the maintenance man if the tub has been refinished.  If so, they should have informed you and told you what to use for cleaning.|`|Nicf5B8faa	The black is MOLD from moisture in the air it happens when you leave the windows open.

Be sure you stir it around in the water and not just let it lay in it.  The color could bleed or run and cause stains.  Add a little salt in it first to help set the cotton dye, the polyester shouldn't cause any problems.  Stir it around for maybe 5 minutes then rinse it and run it through a rinse cycle in the washing machine and let it spin dry.  Then put it in the dryer on high heat.  That will give you all the shrinkage you can possibly get out of it.

The pink/mocha brown colors are popular right now and are a great feminine look.  If you like the brown idea but not the pink, the robins egg blue color with brown are really pretty and popular right now.  <br>       A good idea though, is to find something in your room that you really like or gravitate toward and go with designing your room around your one "inspiration piece".  Good luck.|`|8EWwTYtlaa	I saw a really cool paint technique once... wallpaper the main wall in your room (the one your beds against) with textured wallpaper and paint over the wallpaper, it looks classy and elegant, it was dark purple and gorgeous! And since you probably won't redecorate before you move out, you should think ahead of a more mature room. trust me, you wont want a girlie teenage room in two years.

Without knowing what type of wood the cabinet is made from, I would say that generically, one should at least sand a structure to auniform finish before applying a stain.  You don't necessarily have to sand the wood down to a glass finish, but I would at least sand it using a 100-grit sandpaper.  This will help reduce the amount of "hair" that may arise from applying a wet stain, and run the risk of having the grain raise more than usual.  <br>  Afterwards, I would consider applying some kind of a sealer, to help keep the moisture levels a bit constant.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|94c2e1a976b337d761ad84ebb0a48658aa	If it's unfinished just sand 'til smooth.<br>  <br>  If it has had ANY type of finish applied, any trace of it MUST be removed for the stain to penetrate.|`|3GHXk05saa	It's best.

iAFQPknoaa	What is a 'garage attic'?<br>  <br>  Whatever it it, you would think that the joists would rest on the beam.|`|6O4WTiPQaa	Do what guy #2 said to do.|`|AA10042205	You need to get a nail puller, one that has a handel,  maybe 10-inches long and has a right angle at one end maybe 2-inches long that has the nail puller on it.  Put the nail puller on the nail head, and hit the nail puller with a hammer to drive it under the nail head.  Pull all the nails out of the beam that goes into the ceiling joist.  Put a 2-inch by 6 inch wood board onto the room ceiling under the beam, and support it using 2 x 4 lumber.  Measure from the floor to the ceiling and buy 2-2 X 4-inch lumber and nail them together, one turned sideways to form a tee (T).  Nails should be a #12 box nail, nailed every 8-inches apart. Put a hydraulic jack under the (T) post you made, and have someone in the attic as you jack the post up to where the joist is back under the beam, and re nail, or buy some joist hanging straps at the lumber store.  Ask for Simpson brand are equal.  the strap is a single strap that turned 90-degrees in the middle.  Nail one on each side of the joist, or use deck screws with a square drive, and attach them to the beam.  Good luck|`|AA11215068	You will need a scew jack or screw post, whatever they call it in your part of the world. Anyway, I would place the jack in the middle of the joist and raise it up until the joist is level.

I hope that helps.|`|ee01397bfae4bca4cf2787c8c5f214e9aa	Use a pole jack (buy or rent one) and nail the joists to the beam.

AA11404742	I would still recommend wood if possible.  Depending on how much support you need, a few cedar posts and rails might do the job.  Look for them in a garden center or home improvement store.  I wouldn't use treated lumber, though.  Cedar is naturally resistant to rot.<br>  <br>  PVC might work, but it will sag in the sun's heat, and possibly look unsightly.  If you decide to use PVC any way, go for the stuff with thicker walls - it will be labeled as "schedule 40" or even "schedule 60".  This will be more expensive than the thinner stock, which will be labeled "schedule 30".  Be sure all the fittings are marked for whatever thickness you buy, as I don't think they interchange or fit well if you mix them.<br>  <br>  I am not an expert in this by any means, but my understanding is that grape vines produce grapes only on vines that are 2-3 years old, or less.  After that, the vines don't produce, but the runners that grow off them do.  This means that the old ones can be pruned back, so that the remaining ones have plenty of air and light around them.  And I'm told that February is a good time to prune them.<br>  <br>  Your question reminds me that I need to go prune mine soon, too.

BrarMA1Haa	The nominal system voltage is 240VAC.<br>  <br>  For historical reasons, motors are rated at nameplate voltage rather than nominal system voltage.  Up until about the 1960's, voltage drops out to motors in industrial plants were pretty large, so motor manufacturers designed their motors to operate on a voltage of 220VAC.  These motor typically are the U-frame motors.<br>  <br>  By the 1960's, power systems were becoming stiffer and voltage drops were not so severe, so the motor industry started design motors with a nameplate voltage rating of 230VAC.  These are the modern T-frame motors.<br>  <br>  You will hear 220, 230 and 240VAC terms used interchangeably.  The 220 term is obsolete.  Unless you are specifically trying to replace an old motor with one of the same nameplate rating, you will specify a 230V motor instead.<br>  <br>  Most loads in an electrical system are rated according to nominal system voltage, which is 240VAC.  Motors are the big exception, as they are one of the oldest electrical loads in existence.<br>  <br>  In the larger picture, nominal system voltages run in multiples of 120V.  So for the following system voltages, you would specify a motor with the following nameplate voltages:<br>  <br>  system - motor<br>  480V - 460V<br>  240V - 230V<br>  208V - 200V<br>  120V - 115V<br>  <br>  Very few people specify 200V motors for a 208V system, although they should.  Instead, they use a triple-voltage rated motor for convenience, namely one rated 208-230/460V.  You apply either 208 or 230V to the same winding, so the motor is not optimized for one single voltage.  The compromise is in the 208V; NEMA rated motors will operate successfully a full 10% below nameplate voltage rating.  On a 200V motor, this means down to 180V.  On a 208V motor, this means down to 187V.  Unfortunately, under worst-case conditions, voltage to a motor on a 208V system can drop to 181V which is below the 187V, so a 208V motor could end up operating under-voltaged.<br>  <br>  Refer to the attached reference; it is quite informative.|`|ZJaby58Vaa	Either is proper, it all depends on tolerance.

Go to Lowe's, Home Depot, or any reputable hardware store or lumber yard and tell them what you're doing and they'll provide you with what you need for the vapor barrier.  I hope that helps.
eZDoQPg8aa	The white on a ceiling rule is one of those frustrating ones!  Answer some questions and we'll see what we can figure out!<br>  <br>  1.  Does the room have low, normal or high ceilings?  Do you want to change the perception of the ceiling height?  A low ceiling will look higher if you paint it a lighter color, a high ceiling will look lower if the color isn't quite so light.  Painting the molding to match a light ceiling color also helps "raise" the ceiling visually.<br>  <br>  2.  Does the room get a lot of natural light?  Or do you rely on lamps and light fixtures for lighting when you're in the room?  What kind of atmosphere are you trying to create?  A cozy, nest like feeling?  Or something open and spacious?<br>  <br>  If it's a dark room, a paint that will gently reflect the light helps.  Note, I said gently.  I wouldn't go much higher gloss than satin other wise it might be a bit much.  If you want that cozier feeling go with flat.  Flat paint doesn't reflect light.<br>  <br>  And lastly, what do you want people to notice?  With the darker wall color, a stark white ceiling is going to stick out like the proverbial sore thumb.  A lighter value of the same color that is on the walls will lessen the "shock".  <br>  <br>  I happen to like ceilings in different colors other than plain old white.  My kitchen ceiling is a very pale light blue, walls and cabinets are ivory and we have a good deal of wood tones (counters, furniture, wainscoting) in the room.  My upstairs bath is a very light room so I painted the ceiling a lighter version of the aqua on the walls.  It helps to keep the light from blasting your eyeballs first thing in the morning!  LOL<br>  <br>  Rules with ceilings are just like any other rules, don't do it if you don't like it!  And it is only paint!  You might find you like a darker color for a base and a faux finish over it in lighter colors.....make some sample boards and have fun!|`|8G42oyydaa	Go with white ceiling paint, too much of a dark colour will make the room seem small and dark, like a box. You want contrast so the wall colour will pop.  Also think resale, walls are easy for someone to paint but most people are not so crazy about painting ceilings. Ceilings painted in any colour other than white are a decorating mistake. I think most people do it because they get paint on the ceiling while painting the walls and dont know what to do to get it off.|`|t5xnbgKkaa	I think that white might be rather stark against the dark beige. you might use white for the cornice, if any, and another beige for the ceiling.You might take a look at the two sites below.especially the second.<br>  <br>  www.dulux.co.uk/colours/index<br>  <br>  www.crownpaint.co.uk/paint-and-colour/...|`|kjOsSmM0aa	I would say definitely go with white. It helps keep the room from looking as small (though dark beige isn't as shrinking as dark brown or other colors) I would still go with white. But use a flat paint!|`|0nqf9tmfaa	Yes, flat white. And lighten up the beige a little. It will feel cozier.|`|CpLLA6Niaa	yes- use ceiling paint- it's FLAT and really white.  Don't use any other sheen- it will reflect light from lamps etc.|`|RzHzWootaa	Have you seen the tin look ceiling tiles? You can paint them any color but then use a metallic to cover them. They reflect the light. The copper color is awesome. It would be pretty with the dark beige. Lighter colors will make the ceiling seem higher so if a small room I would go with maybe a snow white to maybe an off white color. Not bright white.|`|l9xnybUMaa	yup, the trim too!|`|8zUS5EQJaa	go with off white, do not use a brite white

63e413147f262ec68d5946ef36ffb354aa	1. In general if you live east of the Rockies you could have trouble with high humidity causing rust in any metal tools.  You will need to protect them with oil or other coating. WD-40 is not a good oil for tools that will come in contact with wood as it interfers with the finish.  West of the Rockies most areas have low humidity so rust is not a problem if you watch where you put your cool drinks.<br>  2.  If you plan to do much work in a single car garage do not plan to put you car in there.  Put all your large power tools on wheels so they can be moved around to have adequate access.  I would not survive if my table saw was not on wheels and mine is a 2 car garage devoted solely to my wood shop. When I deal with full size sheets of plywood I move the table saw to the open door and use sawhorses inside and outside.<br>  3. For lighting you should be able to add more lights to the existing circuit, but check it first.  If you do not know how get a electrician.  You will likely need additional circuits to run power tools.  You will need to evaluate the total load you plan based on what you have to see what you need.  Again if you can not do these calculation yourself get an electrician.  You will not have much of a shop if you burn your house down.  You wife will also not appreciate you popping breakers all the time.<br>  4.  Shelves and peg boards on the walls will add space for your tools.  I also have old dressers for hand tools under both workbenches. Besides many hand and small power tools you will find yourself awash with nails, screws and many small parts.  Find a good system of storing and "finding" all those small parts will make you shop time much more pleasant.|`|8AUHuHsIaa	garrages this size are easy to use for small shop use walls to hang shelfs organise tools for each shelf if u need to put car in leave high enough to get it in so u dont hit it use as mush wall as u neeed to also have good work area for tabel or bench to work on also then under bench use doors with shelf for storage  u got enough room to buield any thing  from arts and crafts to furniture  as far as temp. use good insalation for walls and celing find breaker box and see if u got any empty breakers open then add wiers to get the lighting u need and outlets for your tools
tZ3jcxvjaa	no you will burn up and break more bits than its worth.|`|pDcrfhm8aa	Yes, but I would think of a few better tools for the job though.  After personally using one of the fanciest units they put out with the touch control, pilot light and all the lights and bells to offer. it stopped quick, never to go again as I tried to trim a stair edge. Drywall dust gets sucked into the cooling vents and the bushings get messed up. The right angle adapters get funky if you cut a short length of sheet metal. The button to lock the shaft in place pops out after a short time. After three of these things, I have one sitting at the bottom of a box used only for creative work if I run out of possibilities. They are not meant for extreme  or use for no more than a few minutes time at a crack. I can and have more purposeful tools such as a grinder with a metal cut off wheel that is cheaper than what they charge. A diamond blade that is cheaper and way out performs theirs. Sanding attachments that work better and longer on a Ryobi VSR drill (Ryobi is a horse!). An extension on a Dremil tool that blows the snot out of RotoZip for longevity and productivity. I will never buy another Rotozip product again! The design is flawed with the air intake to the unit being so close to the business end and the materials it's constructed out of ill conceived for the applications given all have needed a nail to lock the shaft in place after a short time and the aftermarket ad-ons are made cheap.The only product from them I am entirely happy with is the tool bag which has lasted for some years. Sure it will cut it. But not for long and not real well. But if you don't mind throwing your money away, well then....|`|AA10042205	The first answer is right, roto-zip are made for thin materials, and sheetrock.

Um die Handtücher wieder sch?n flauschig und weich zu bekommen hilft es, sie für eine Stunde in Essigwasser zu legen, das l?st den abgelagerten Kalk und macht die Fasern wieder flexibler. Danach ordentlich durchwaschen und Weichspüler benutzen. Bei Handtüchern ist es ratsam einen etwas besseren Markenweichspüler zu benutzen, man braucht weniger und die Handtücher werden wirklich weich. Wichtig w?re es auf jeden Fall zum Waschgang einen Wasserenth?rter dazu zu geben, das verhindert, dass sich schnell wieder Kalk in den Handtüchern festsetzt. <br>  Anschlie?end auf der Leine trocknen, aber rechtzeitig abh?ngen, also so bald sie schranktrocken sind.

YEc9soW5aa	you could use a metal putty knife on the floor and a plastic on on the walls. a chisel? you may have to do spot repairs on the wall. it really depends. are the floors and walls bare? this question has so many variants.|`|ba624fdd52931efd82ee5e913450c186aa	Are you talking about the basement walls getting splattered when they pour the floor? If so, the easiest way is an air chisel with the widest spade you can fit on it (takes less time that way).

XzRKYYGsaa	Vinegar is acidic , and will fade some fabrics . My grandmother always told em to use salt to set in colors , and when I wash my husbands jeans I always uses salt to set the color in and yes it does work . If I am just washing one pair of his jeans I use 1 1/2 cup of salt . but for your silk dress I would dissolve 3/4 o a cup of salt in warm water and let it sit for a few minutes until the water is cool , and wash the dress on gentle cycle , and then if your gonna dry it , dry it on the air dry setting .<br>  <br>  As for stains I now use ZOTE it is a laundry bar it is very gentle , but yet powerful at removing stains  even dried milk on babys clothes red clay , and even greasy stains . You can get it at some dollar stores , but I havent seen any at the dollar stores in the small town I live in , so I get mine at a local Latino store , for the small bar it is around 67 cents and for a large 14.1 oz is about a dollar and it lasts for a long time .|`|36R3v5VBaa	salt, one load one box of salt. But I would think twice on silk, Lip Gloss is greasey and is very hard to get out. My husband washes his clothes with a can  of coke to get grease out.
36R3v5VBaa	use liquid detergent instead of powder, usually if there are marks it's because it did not dissolve all the way. Maybe you should wash them alone and put the detergent in some warm water first to let it dissolve before you put it in the machine.|`|qDXdCBgbaa	first option is the easiest, use a liquid detergent.  I wash in cold water as well, and use liquid for the same reason.<br>  <br>  if you really want to use a powder, fill a measuring cup with hot water, disolve the recomended  amount of soap, then pour it in.  most powders do not disolve well in cold water....

djzxRIDoaa	I would think it's very sensitive to the economy in general, as aside from funerals and weddings flowers are considered a luxury.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, you get to work with flowers!
GyB5Yfgmaa	Apple seed is not poisonous, just plant them.|`|d9f5eef57376876109b9a113a7c9af2eaa	Okay, so apple seeds have a bit of arsenic in them.  It's only poisonous if you chew up whole bunches and bunches and bunches of them.  If you eat them whole, they drop through you.  Even if you eat a few and chew - it's not enough to do anything to you.  I suspect there is shampoo that would make you way sicker, way quicker, if you drink it...and you put that stuff on your head, don't you?<br>  <br>  And the shell of the seed is not poisonous.  You can touch them with your bare hands from now until the end of time without any harm<br>  <br>  Just plant them|`|RsFcilQaaa	you don't. no one wants a poisonous apple tree.
YPRw3xYDaa	The semi gloss is a little bit more shiny than Satin and also a little more durable. Semi gloss is also easier to clean & is suggested for use in high traffic areas and where water is used such as bathrooms and kitchens. Both are nice finishes it just depends on what you want and where you are using it.|`|Lg4cmiL5aa	Jen is correct, just think about how shiny you want the area. Stores that sell paint should have some samples of the sheen of paints, gives you the idea.

NGz7R9enaa	If the instructions didn't help after reading them, I would suggest going to the manufactures website or calling the company's 1800 number.
7DlEN6lXaa	We have an HE machine but I use about 1/4 of the amount of regular detergent because it's so much cheaper. I don't have any problems and I've been using it for 4 years now.
Gzk1TQFAaa	Try spraying it with WD40, then wiggle it out.|`|s8cZsSX0aa	Simply disconnect the trap under your sink and use a long enough screwdriver to push it out from the bottom toward the top. Reconnect the trap and your good to go.|`|ACgjjAqXaa	let me know how that goes
yu9PHV4Maa	I get plenty of calls for work from people who have bought them...go with the Combat roach gel, it will come in a large syringe and it will have no odor and is made by the same company that make the professional line of roach baits. Even place it next to your Riddex to keep the roaches from moving into it as a home..try avoid spraying insecticide after you apply it....You can place it in the cabinets or on a piece of cardboard and slide under the counter appliances. You will see them for a week or so but the numbers will start dropping until gone.  Avoid sprinkling borax boric acid all over the place , you can make the problem worse along with it making the place more of a health hazard than by using products developed for such use.  With the baits used properly you can have a roach free home even if you are surrounded by roach infested neighbors.|`|94c2e1a976b337d761ad84ebb0a48658aa	I've never bought one, nor do I plan to.  If you want some more opinions search here, Yahoo Answers, for hundreds of opinions.<br>  <br>  By the way, if you're in an apartment building, and other neighbors have them, too, nothing you buy or use will ever get rid of them.|`|AA11215068	Store bought roach killing products are not very effective. Most people will tell you to buy good old fashioned Borax power soap and spread it around liberally to combat roaches. That would be the cheapest and most effective way to take care of the problem.<br>  <br>  Beyond that, contact an established restaurant and inquire as to who takes care of their exterminating. Get in contact with that person and they should be able to provide you with some genuinely industrial type roach killing product. I hope that helps.
b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	Use a putty knife and carefully scrape it off.|`|a5f8fb915b0c89693e97dc814aba467faa	If the table has a slick finish, just scrape it off. Try a plastic putty knife, or a plastic spatula so that you don't scratch the table.<br>  <br>  If the finish is porous, use sandpaper.|`|VX16L24Taa	make sure its dry completely<br>  and then use your nail to nudge it off easily<br>  you might want to try to scratch<br>  a place of the table that's not easily noticeable if you scratch the wood<br>  do it lightly and see if it makes a big difference =D<br>  <br>  good_luck|`|8786e426eb830d7eccdbed5c73b39ec7aa	try a really sharp razor blade and scraping it off. but dont dig into the wood. you have to hold the razor so its almost flat (parallel to table top) and slowly scape. should get most of it off. good luck. ps itll be easier to do this if the wood is laquered or varnished?!|`|QHBuH39jaa	Use magic eraser.  Seriously, its magic.|`|6Nj5VZQ8aa	Use dryer HOT until it melt into a liquid form, then clean it up with a white vinegar / baking soda powder paste.
v8FlpPbGaa	i've solved this problem. i bought these pretty hooks not just plain ones,mine are antique looking and i hung them behind my door also some in my walk in closet.they look nice.i also bought a jacket/coat stand but i use it to hang my purses and scarves as well.|`|a6779150ee307fd979ff5c54c79e3cabaa	I would say that generally speaking it's better not to hang the purses due to putting stress on the strap.|`|AA10950898	I'd buy some nice stackable wicker storage containers (with lids).  You can place more than 1 handbag in each.|`|WX1RJt1Haa	You could get a carpet cardboard roll and wallpaper it or paint it and put it in the corner of your room. Take cup hooks and stagger them up and down the tube and hang away!|`|l9xnybUMaa	Get cubbys for each purse, fill them with drycleaner bags to hold their shape while not in use and shelf them in the upper part of your closet where you can see them.
