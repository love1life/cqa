MS Word CAN edit and save plain text files, but this is not the primary function of it, and there are many other programs that work better.<br>  <br>  Microsoft bundles Notepad with Windows, and it functions as a baseline text editor. You can get fancier ones for free, such as Notepad++ and Notepad2. <br>  <br>  In any event, the point of this answer is to clarify that Word is not a text editor...and that the ability to edit text does not qualify a program as a text editor, rather the ability to edit and produce plain text files.|`|7cf2315c89717c9e6aa8da4d01d3c5eaaa	A text editor is any program that edits text.

GZlyhWrJaa	You can add movies and animated GIF files to slides from files on your computer, the Microsoft Clip Organizer, a network, or an intranet. To add the movie or animated GIF file, you insert it onto the specific slide. There are several ways you can start the movie or GIF file: have it play automatically when the slide is displayed, click it, or create a timing for it so that it plays after a certain delay. You can also keep a movie playing over several slides or have it play continuously throughout your presentation. You can also set movie options, such as hiding the movie frame or resizing it.<br>  <br>  How to Add Movie (Powerpoint 2007)<br>  To prevent possible problems with links, it is a good idea to copy the movies into the same folder as your presentation before you add the movies to your presentation.<br>  1. In Normal view, click the slide to which you want to add a movie or animated GIF file.<br>  2. On the Insert tab, in the Media Clips group, click the arrow under Movie.<br>  3. do onw of the following <br>  a) Click Movie from File, locate the folder that contains the file, and then double-click the file that you want to add.<br>  b) Click Movie from Clip Organizer, scroll to find the clip that you want in the Clip Art task pane (task pane: A window within an Office application that provides commonly used commands. Its location and small size allow you to use these commands while still working on your files.), and then click it to add it to the slide. <br>  <br>  Unlike pictures or drawings, movie files are always linked (linked object: An object that is created in a source file and inserted into a destination file, while maintaining a connection between the two files. The linked object in the destination file can be updated when the source file is updated.) to your presentation, rather than embedded (embedded object: Information (object) contained in a source file and inserted into a destination file. Once embedded, the object becomes part of the destination file. Changes you make to the embedded object are reflected in the destination file.) in it. When you insert a linked movie file, PowerPoint creates a link to the movie file's current location. If you later move the movie file to a different location, PowerPoint cannot locate it when you want the file to play. It is a good practice to copy the movies into the same folder as your presentation before you insert the movies.

I understand if you require a laptop for work or anything important but getting a laptop just because its "small and cool" and "i can use my computer anywhere" is the dumbest reason to get a laptop. I personally have a desktop and a laptop, and I use my desktop almost 95% of the time. I don't hate my laptop or anything but I think it's useless since my laptop never goes outside of my room. I doubt most high schools require a laptop. I'm in high school and my school doesn't even require people to have computers at home.<br>  <br>  For gaming, desktops is the way to go unless you want to buy heavy, expensive laptops with dedicated graphics.<br>  <br>  Also, trust me, typing on a tiny keyboard is hell and takes time to get used to. Typing on a full size keyboard is the way to go.

Nowadays there are Solid State Disks (SDD) that resist shocks since they don't have movable parts.<br>  <br>  You probably have your laptop turned off when you put them in your backpack.

That is ridiculous.<br>  <br>  The answer is no, move about freely and enjoy your Macbook, the data is completely safe on the HDD and it can't shake off.

8WvzuS5Kaa	There might be various reasons for this.  <br>  <br>  1.  Based on my  experience, if you are using a laptop, your thumb unknowingly touches the scroll pane which is closest to the space bar.  Nowadays, laptops come with scroll bars in the scroll pane.<br>  <br>  2.  Some "sticky" keys make it behave like that.<br>  <br>  3.   If it is Microsoft Word,  the text cursor stays where you initially left it.  Scrolling using the mouse does not bring the cursor along.  So when you are at the end of a document using the mouse alone, and you try to use the arrow keys, the arrow key will try to move the "text cursor" and focuses the attention there, scrolling you back a cpl of pages.<br>  <br>  4.  Otherwise it might be a malware or virus that has infiltrated through any malicious code on a web-page you have visited.|`|4f51ca5e733afd3aff18667f295ba3c6aa	Your computer might be controlled remotely by someone..

If there is a video out there with misused government logos, its not gonna kill anyone.

Go deeper and deeper till you reach a portal..Take an elevator or go down the stairs if you wish.  Be sure to close your eyes, concentrate and breath deep and slowly. Concentrate on your breathing. Step through the portal into a place where time doesn't exist, float up to a plane like the rings of saturn and stand there. This is the material plane where everything in reality is manifested. Imagine having the laptop and all the good that it will do for you and your family. Let an umbrella of light and goodness surround it. Then once you have a clear vision of that, lean over the edge and visualize dropping it into reality. You will have it soon. unless your motives are selfish or evil.

Here is a list showing some of the most common ways to save;<br>  1. There should be a button of a floppy disk on the program that you could click usually on the top some where.<br>  2. Depending on the version of these programs you have, look at the upper-left corner of the program and you will see ether 'File' or a circular button but the Windows logo on it. Click the one you see and select 'Save'.<br>  3. Holding down the 'Ctrl' button and then pressing the 'S' button with the 'Ctrl' button automatically saves the document, this is the most popular way considering it is the fastest and most convenient way but I suggest doing it two times in a row to make sure it has worked.<br>  <br>  Now to Print Screen usually every keyboard has this option built right into it. There should be a button on your keyboard that says 'Print Screen' right on it. Just set up your screen the way you want it to show in the picture and push the 'Print Screen' button. Then after you have done just that you just need to click paste in a program like Paint or Photo Shop.|`|RRzYUlyxaa	Are you referring to taking a screen shot to use in Powerpoint and to print? If that is the case, hold down the ALT key, then hit the key that says "Print Screen", "PrtScrn" or something similar, depending on your keyboard, on the top row of keys. Then, go to whatever program you wish to use, and paste into your document/presentation/etc. You may want to paste into something like Paint and save as a JPEG to make it easier, if it works better for you.|`|HOq5Urn1aa	I can help you with the first part of your question<br>  <a href="http://www.download.com/Gadwin-PrintScreen/3000-2094_4-10123018.html?tag=fd_prodlink" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/Gadwin-PrintScre...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jingproject.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jingproject.com/</a><br>  <br>  I do not know antything about powerpoint, so I can not help you there

Push on them and be sure they are tight. Is the light on your monitor, what color is it? What monitor is it.. You must have another monitor so if that doesnt do any good then go get another monitor and plug it in. what happens? If it works your monitor is messed up if the new one doesnt it must be your video card or motherboard. Your going to get it.

21c061491048a06cfb0b83a1bab940ebaa	I am not familiar with 1and1. However, I am a website developer, and I checked out their website. It looks like you get pretty standard features, depending on which package you choose.<br>  <br>  It can definitely be used with Studio 8. This is because Studio 8 can be used with virtually any website hosting plan, since it is a development tool you use from your own desktop and it doesn't reside on the server itself. I am not totally familiar with their free software, but they are pretty well known products.<br>  <br>  As far as the timeframe a website can be completed, that will be completely dependent on what type of website you are building, how many pages, how much information per page, and your skills using the site builder. <br>  <br>  Do you know how to use Studio 8? Studio 8 is one of the most exceptional development suites available, however, there is a lot to learn. It is not meant for a beginner to pop up a site in a day or two (an expert could, for a small project).

Nvidia 8800 gtx is a high peroformance video card that can handle the heat that gaming radiates plus gives you the performance that you want and need. plus they use a sony hard drive that is the best on the market i recommend the 160 gb it is the best according to pc magazine but dell has won the best computer from consumer report ten years running. good luck hope i was helpful to you|`|RI1tz1qRaa	go fr intel if you wnt real prfrmance.and the quad core.its a good choice.good luck wth it.

JVZMiLitaa	It is known as "Speech Recognition".<br>  An example product that does this is "Dragon Naturally Speaking".<br>  To use it requires a one-time training session where one reads aloud some text put on the screen by the Dragon.   It takes about 40 minutes.  After that initial training session, it will recognize that user's voice and produce text on the screen about as fast as you can talk.  This modern example is capable of handling what is called "connected speech".  That is, one does not have to pause between each word for it to be able to handle it.<br>     Best of all, one licensed copy of such a product, at least for the example given, will allow up to 6 different users to train it to recognize and process their speech into text.<br>     There may be more expensive versions of the basic package.  Some will include digital voice recording equipment and an especially good microphone optimized for voice frequencies.

d9e2487b31d689d39d86febebcf9023eaa	If Windows inexpicably closes and your PC shuts down, it's almost certainly overheated. The PC, which monitors the temperature of the CPU, is protecting it's delicate circuits from the ravages of heat. (On the other hand, if you PC frequently shuts off without closing Windows first, causing an error message when you next boot, it's likley time to replace the power supply.) <br>  <br>  If you have a laptop:<br>  <br>  Make sure that nothing's blocking the vents in any location where you commonly use the PC. Be especially careful about running it on top of pillows or blankets, which can easily block the vents. <br>  With the PC off, spray compressed air into the vents to remove dust. Use only a moisture-free compressed air canister. <br>  If these steps don't help, take it to a professional. Unless you really know what you're doing, you don't want to mess with your laptop's innards.<br>  Could software be the culprit? Unlikely, but if your PC isn't overheating, a bad driver may be at fault. Try updating your video and sound drivers just to be safe. And it's possible that a malicious program is behind the damage.

loI1S7Vxaa	In my opinion there really isn't a "finite" amount, I would say a good average is about 30 users. Keep in mind that Internet connections only get used when sending or receiving data, meaning that a connection mostly stays idle- unless there is use of audio or video streaming, such as watching YouTube videos. However it's up to the LAN administrator to block sites which use bandwidth unnecessarily during work time. The office Internet connection should be limited to basic web and email access, which keeps costs down, and worker productivity up.

Pop up blockers are useless too, they are just a waste of space.<br>  Here's what you need to do.<br>  1st, don't waste your time with AVG, spybot, ad aware, CA, spyhunter, superantispyware, avast, panda, kaspersky, windows defender or anything of the sort. Stay away from anything that is FREE when it comes to spyware and antivirus. There is a reason why they free. They are NOT good. <br>  2nd, You need some of the best software out there. Norton Systemworks is very good. That's the only good software from Norton. I wouldn't recommend Norton Internet security, its not that great. Now the best software you should get is Spysweeper with Anti-virus, this software is too good and gets better everyday. This is elite software. It blocks over 174,500 threats. No other software can compete with that or come close for that matter. It catches everything. I've used them all and it is 2nd to none.<br>  3rd, after you install and update the software, since its in your system you will have to turn off system restore and then go into safe mode and run the scan and eliminate the virus. then after removal, reboot and turn system restore back on.<br>  4th, (Optional) I recommend a Firewall from Zone Alarm, their free version is so good. Or you can buy their Pro version, but the free version will do more than the job.<br>  5th, any probs during or after you do all this, send me an e-mail.|`|gKr2Os40aa	run spybot search and destroy, and  adaware,  see if that doesn't fix it.|`|erl8fX5raa	install other antimalware program: AdAdware, SpyBot, XoftSpy e.t.c.<br>  Try to install anti-pop up application (google toolbar) or use FireFox browser.<br>  Good luck!

bd815bdda75f7cf7bc295090a43f02a5aa	Ok, most laptops that use a wireless connection connect to a wireless local area network (WLAN), which is nicknamed WiFi.  This limits you to about 100 feet from the source of the signal, but there are a lot of "signals" out there.   In other words, there are a lot of these areas called wireless access points that you can connect to out there.  If you would like to have access to the internet everywhere, you will benefit greatly from a wireless data card from your mobile phone provider.  I'm guessing you are in europe, since you mention travelling via train.  This would be a benefit, since the prices for these cards are less in europe and have faster connection speeds than the ones in the U.S.|`|AA11250667	With wireless you still need a device to transmit like a router.

AA10700604	Hello Daniel C,<br>  <br>  OK here's my list of things I like about the Macintosh over Windows.  I'm sorry that it is so long, but that's how it goes.<br>  <br>  *  No computer viruses.  <br>  You hear from the Windows people that it's because there are fewer Macs out there, but I think it's because of the Mac OS and it's Unix kernel.  That doesn't explain why Vista got viruses before it was officially released.  The Macintosh comes out of the box as a closed system.  If you want it to be networked and remotely operated, you can make that happen, but you have to change it's settings first.  Windows machines come out of the box as a wide open vulnerable system.    That's so the IT guy can set up the hardware, attach it to the company's network, and install the software remotely from the comfort of his own desk.  ActiveX and InternetExplorer leaves the Windows OS wide open to hacks and viruses.  The Macintosh OS simply isn't set up that way. <br>  <br>  If you want to install any kind of software onto your Mac, you first need to type in your administrative password.  There is no auto-install for a virus to attach itself to your Mac without your Okay.  That is the simple answer why there hasn't been any viruses for the Macintosh in the past 6 years.  Another is that first year programmers learn how to create simple Windows script viruses their first year of class.  Mac programmers simply love their computers and have no desire to create such an abomination.  We love our Mac programmers and happily pay what ever they ask for their good, hard work.<br>  <br>  *  Games.  <br>  I enjoy the games that I play on my Mac, but It's true that there simply aren't as many games out there for the Mac as Windows.  Hopefully, with the Mac now using an Intel processor, we will start to see more games being developed for the Mac.  But, honestly, don't most people get their gaming fix by playing with video game consoles (such as NES, PS, Wii, or XBox), rather than playing games on their computers?<br>  <br>  *  Software.  <br>  There's a lot more software for the Macintosh now, than before Mac OS X arrived.  Much of the Mac's new software is simply Unix ports.  There is also a large open source and public domain/shareware development community that has been supporting the Mac OS.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/</a><br>  <br>  You can run Unix X-windows on your Macintosh now too.  Apple has been designated as the largest distributor of Unix in the world.  If you have one of the new Intel-based Macs you can now run Windows programs natively using a program called Boot Camp and/or Parallel.  There is also a Java Virtual Machine for the Mac too.<br>  <br>  There's still a ton of programs made specifically for the Mac.  Most of these are programmed in machine language, so they're lightening fast.  Apple watches over their developers closely, to make sure everything runs like it's supposed to; that it runs the Macintosh way.  There's also a lot of Windows ports too.  I use Microsoft Office on my Mac at work all the time. Although the Macintosh versions of Windows software are way behind in features than their Windows brethren, the Macintosh programs seem to run better, faster and are not as susceptible to problems as the Windows ports.  Go figure!<br>  <br>  Where the Macintosh really shines is in the creative software area.  I'm a printer, so I know that the Macintosh pioneered desktop publishing.  I think that most structured drawing, paint/graphics, and music programs got their start here too.  Video and film editing and production is now very big on the Mac.  Many people complain about how expensive some of these programs are, but frankly, professional programs are always more expensive than the cheaper consumer-level programs that are out there.  Stuff like iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD, etc. come free with your Macintosh, while other programs are quite affordable.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/macosx" rel="nofollow">http://www.versiontracker.com/macosx</a><br>  <br>  *  Less problems<br>  The Macintosh simply works.  There really isn't very many problems using a Mac compared to a Windows PC.  Check out the computer questions here on Yahoo! Answers.  There are a lot of Windows,  "Why can't I get this to work?" questions here.  Even though there are a lot of Mac users here, there doesn't seem to be very many Mac questions.  The Mac simply works.  Naturally, there are a few problems with any kind of computer hardware, but these are few and far between on a Mac.<br>  <br>  * Hardware Power -vrs- Expense<br>  <br>  Right, the Macintosh is a little more proprietary and you really need to buy hardware that tells you that it's Macintosh compatible.  You can't just buy some cheap hardware, piece it together, and make a Mac, like you can with some PCs.  But, then, you don't have Plug-and-Pray either.  Again, the Mac simply works.<br>  <br>  We also hear from Windows users that Windows PCs are cheaper than Macs.  True, you can buy hardware with the barest of graphics cards, hard drives, and other components, or you can buy the best and end up spending the same amount as a Mac.  It's your choice, but that's why you see Macs holding up and being used a lot longer than these Window PCs.<br>  <br>  Oh, and since we're talking about hardware, yes, you can get yourself a USB multiple-buttoned mouse, plug it into your Mac, and use it just fine, thank you.  Don't worry about it.<br>  <br>  *  Mac OS X<br>  It's a very simple, basic, easy-to-use OS.  It's highly graphic, so your kids or your grandmother could learn to use it, and it's also got a terminal, so the geekiest guy can enjoy using it to it's fullest extent.  Windows users will recognize many of the same features that they use on their OS, but there are a few things that are strictly Macintosh.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/switch101/" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/support/switch101/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/mac101/" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/support/mac101/</a><br>  <a href="http://switchtoamac.com/guides/" rel="nofollow">http://switchtoamac.com/guides/</a><br>  <br>  I have loved it because it's always responsive.  You throw in a CD and the icon for it pops up on the desktop along with a dialog box asking if you want a specific program to use with it.  There's no need to search for drives.  If it's a music CD, iTunes launches to play it.  If you plug in your digital camera iPhoto launches to import the pictures.  If you're looking for a file buried deep inside your Mac's file structure, you can use Spotlight and it might find the file before you're done typing the first three letters of the name.<br>  <br>  Again, I'm sorry that this is so long, but I get tired of the misinformation that the Windows guys are spreading about the Macintosh, and I wanted to be sure to respond to all of their rants with the facts.  Go into your local Macintosh dealer and play with the Macintosh yourself, and see what you think.  Best of luck with your final decision.  Take care.<br>  <br>  --Rick|`|AA10034577	Imac has lots of cool capabilities and such, the only drawback is that software can be hard to find and expensive|`|1adb34331df0dc6db32a41d6446bc7b7aa	Imac has a good interface but one thing if for sure, it cant use Windows programs and programs for IMac is rare and expensive.|`|2545e155e303c5adba6838fc91624d3caa	HAHAHA!!

The best option is to split the video into multiple pieces so that you'll have multiple files upto 9:59 minutes each.<br>  <br>  Splitting it up should also resolve the more than 100 mb problem, but if not, then you can either compress it into a different form or split it again.<br>  <br>  To split it, you can use a bunch of programs that will cut off either the beginning or the end of a video file. You can even use something  like windows movie maker, though there are better programs.|`|4d84c598896bf6564e81c0249c465327aa	why dont u split it up into 2 or 3 videos|`|8998732423f690a826bfd688e31e9d20aa	You need a directors account... apply for one from youtube.<br>  <br>  Other than that, split it into multiple pieces.
a37815c4ed823b316a598c8075b66057aa	Since you have a director's account your video can be greater than 10 minutes, but it still can't go past 100 mb.<br>  <br>  What you'll have to do is compress the video into a different format that takes up less space. What format is the video in right now?|`|AA10182911	you can't do that|`|ae724cdaa6c7d479232134ce10db8a8daa	hit the save to favorites caz thats what i do and i have some whith 20 min

AVG is very lightweight, doesn't interfere with your daily use of the computer. it updates itself automatically, and the update process is incredibly fast.<br>  <br>  and of course, best of all: 100% free.  stick with it - you can't go wrong.|`|AA11255292	The first thing for you to do is learn how to use Punctuation.

They used to be part of a.o. the notorious Wilhelmina Scouting Network WSN modeling scam. Just use any search engine to dig up tons of well-proven dirt about these criminal characters.<br>  <br>  As usual this deceptive Defrawy "business model" is all about getting a lot of hopefull cheap labour (like commission based "scout" jobs and franchisees) to ignorantly scam masses of hopefull consumers (like aspiring talent or job hunters), selling "opportunities" with even less chances to be profitable than a lottery (like the purported Talent Palooza contest in the Gaylord Palms Resort & Convention Center).<br>  <br>  See the scammer's pathetic efforts to promote the (then still future) scam TooSpoiled, trolling with six aliases in one board topic, lol!<br>  <br>  Google Adwords, Monster, Careerbuilder and Employmentguide have banned Defrawy from being their customer.<br>  <br>  Address on the Toospoiled.comsite is 447 Broadway, 4th Floor New York, NY 10013, but reportedly they moved out of this posh Soho office without previous notice, leaving the employees without their last 2 weeks pay.

AA12101931	Over the years I've used McAfee, Norton and Computer Associates "suites".  Norton is a memory hog and everything seems to run slower. CA and McAfee seem to be about equal.  I don't buy into the urban legends that these companies create the viruses and spyware so you'll buy their products.  No product is 100% effective whether you pay for it or get it free.  Using that logic, Microsoft is creating viruses and spyware so we'll use their Live OnceCare suite. Doesn't make sense when you look at it that way because Microsoft just recently got into the antivirus and antispyware business. They are not hurting for money where they have to create viruses, etc.<br>  <a href="http://www.windowsonecare.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.windowsonecare.com/</a><br>  <br>  Anyway, McAfee is reputable and it's been around long enough for a lot of business to use it.

Spending longer that isn't necessary, since the strain is already relieved. <br>  <br>  You can't "catch up".

a88a434ae105f58bdae20563dfaa7a0caa	Suppose that<br>       double x = 4.5678;<br>  <br>  Then, ...<br>  x == 4.5678<br>  100*x == 456.78<br>  Math.round(100*x) == 457<br>  Math.round(100*x)/((double)100) == 4.57<br>  <br>  (I'll let you convert that into a function "static double round100th(double x)".)<br>  <br>  <br>  FWIW, if you're writing a program about prices, and you want to round to the nearest cent (or whatever unit), consider that maybe you should be doing all your arithmetic with ints (cents), rather than doubles.  And if you are just trying to create a String from a double, I wouldn't divide by ((double)100); I would stick with int and use /100, %100 to pull out the whole and fractional amounts.

The range and transfer speeds have been improved, but in many cases it may not matter.  The older 802.11B and 802.11G work fine for most situations.  The 802.11N standard has not yet been approved, but those in the no claim it might be next week.  Not all the existing cards might meet the new standard, so I would wait to see what happens.  However, it will take 12-18 months for support for this new standard to be widely available.  So, for the time being I would not worry about it and buy a B or G card.  They are very inexpensive so you should be able to afford to upgrade later.
AA10006450	The "View Image" idea sounds like a good one.  If you need another suggestion, here's one:<br>  <br>  I think the problem is that the site you're visiting is using JavaScript in an ill-advised way to fix the size of the window in which the image is displayed, and has disabled the resizing options that are usually available.<br>  <br>  The following is worth a try:<br>  Tools, Options, Content.  To the right of the JavaScript toggle, click on Advanced.  Turn off the options you see there, such as "Disable or replace context menus".<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|RrA3K10paa	put your pointer on the very edge of the window and a double arrow will show. when it show, hold down the left mouse button and pull the window in the direction to go bigger.|`|NxNFAKhEaa	Right click on the image and select View Image option.

873a52fafb62d823b21a353c5d0f1099aa	Hola Chino:<br>  <br>  No indicas que sistema operativo estás usando, pero si es Windows de Microsoft, existen diversos mecanismos.<br>  Algunos son:<br>  <br>  1) Si son archivos creados con Word o Excel puedes agregar la opcion de contrase?a:<br>  <br>  Establecer una contrase?a para abrir o modificar un archivo<br>  Cuando cree una contrase?a, anótela y guárdela en un lugar seguro. Si pierde la contrase?a, no podrá abrir o tener acceso al documento protegido con la contrase?a. <br>  <br>  Abra el archivo. <br>  En el menú Herramientas, haga clic en Opciones y, a continuación, en Seguridad. <br>  Siga uno de estos procedimientos:<br>  <br>  a) Crear una contrase?a para abrir<br>  Escriba una contrase?a en el cuadro "Contrase?a" y, a continuación, haga clic en "Aceptar". <br>  Escriba de nuevo la contrase?a en el cuadro "Vuelva a escribir la contrase?a" y, a continuación, haga clic en "Aceptar". <br>  <br>  <br>  Crear una contrase?a de escritura<br>  Escriba una contrase?a en el cuadro "Contrase?a de escritura" y haga clic en "Aceptar". <br>  Escriba de nuevo la contrase?a en el cuadro "Vuelva a escribir la contrase?a" y haga clic en "Aceptar". <br>  <br>  2) Otra forma es tomar tus archivos y comprimirlos con algún utilitario de compresión como WinZip o WinRAR, y al momento de hacerlo le activas la opcion de contrase?a. Después  verificas que el archivo compactado haya quedado bien, y borras los archivos originales. Esta forma te sirve para cualquier tipo de archivo (word, excel, gráficos, mp3, etc.)<br>  <br>  3) Como te indican algunas respuestas anteriores, puedes usar utilitarios de privacidad, tales como Hide Secret Files 2.01, que lo puedes bajar desde <a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Security/Lockdown/Hide-Secret-Files.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.softpedia.com/get/Security/Lo...</a><br>  <br>  Ahí también hay otros programas que te pueden servir. La mayoría en inglés, pero no es dificil usarlos.<br>  <br>  Otro método muy simple (y seguro) es que guardes tus archivos privados en un pendrive. Si usas Windows 2000 o  XP, el pendrive es reconocido por el PC en forma automática. Luego de copiar tus archivos a tu pendrive, lo desconectas del PC, lo pones en tu bolsillo, y ya! Si se te llena copialos en un CD, y luego pones tu CD a buen recaudo.<br>  ----------------------|`|447b7025c053ce4f7c163daeb74b0c2daa	yo tampoco|`|fa85fe95e13d63f4f932b7bef7de5841aa	no se|`|fb706a1079cf45d272f6061574bdad1caa	Lo mejor que podrias hacer es aplicar politicas de seguridad.<br>  Si tienes windows Xp, esto lo puedes hacer desde la parte de permisos.|`|a744854f2afaff056f065fccaecb7c7eaa	hay un programa, bueno debe de haber varios.. pero yo conosco uno que sirve para ponerle contrase?as a las carpetas.. se llama Folder guard, hace mucho que lo use.. buscalo en algun buscador... suerte :)|`|c30fa9054c263a48ca5df41e90d5363faa	ponles clave

Tokyopop has translated all of Gensomaden Saiyuki and up to volume 6 of Saiyuki Reload. If your interested in more Saiyuki you can check out this website too.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mangacity.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mangacity.net/</a><br>  <br>  This has the first volume translated by fans in English of Saiyuki Gaiden. As far as I know Tokyopop hasn't really even heard of it yet. Hope this helps
AA12034789	It is a combination of things really... some of which have been mentioned but a few have not.<br>  <br>  1. Practice. This includes practicing writing code that works, reading books and trying to understand what is being said, try the examples given to you for yourself, never walk away from code which you don't fully understand yet.<br>  <br>  2. I touched on this in the first point, reading good books and understanding what is being written. Step through line by line of an example and ask yourself "how does this line work in relation to what has been written before it?"<br>  <br>  3. My favorite and most useful one... pretend you are a computer that can only understand one thing at a time! That is what compilers do. They encounter each line with a fresh look and a library of values. Do the same thing as a compiler.<br>  <br>  4. Join a group of people that have the same skill. When you get together you feed off one another's logic and it helps you develop logical ideas better. You can teach each other ideas behind logic.<br>  <br>  5. Lastly, I like to read a book on philosophical logic sometimes. It helps me a bit with programming. The whole idea of... if all "A's" are "B's" and you are an "A" therefore you are also a "B" type of thing. You can find these sort of things in books about critical thinking. Like the various logic patterns such as modus ponens and modus tollens. After all, programming is a computer variation of true logic.<br>  <br>  Hope some of these ideas come in handy for you as they have for me. Enjoy!|`|c0bb7db47873f4c10aec48db6f7c98a4aa	Practice, practice, practice.<br>  <br>  Rawlyn.|`|11763093832bbc7c1505ce7dbf883dc3aa	You can sharpen your boolean logic through working regularly with SQL queries.|`|80d7142ad0cd1eaa014fad8043581e2aaa	Think towards the solution and steps in order to reach there is programming...
AA11113948	Some web sites, such as <a href="http://www.freetube.us.tc/" rel="nofollow">http://www.freetube.us.tc/</a> provide access to TV channels that have been made available by the broadcaster online. The quality, however, is often not comparable to what you see on TV.<br>  <br>  Another option is to download a peer-to-peer TV application for your computer. These applications typically carry a few TV channels of moderate quality in English and foreign TV channels. An example of this type of application can be found here: <a href="http://www.m0interactive.com/archives/2006/06/17/free_tv_on_c/" rel="nofollow">http://www.m0interactive.com/archives/20...</a><br>  <br>  Please consider the legal implications of using this type of application as you may be attempting to access copyrighted material without permission.

b3c55a530374863879314a719772e481aa	I'd run the system file checker. SFC will detect and repair system files that have gone missing or somehow become corrupt, including those that comprise IE.<br>  <br>  SFC is a good utility to run when you suspect that system files have been somehow corrupted. It validates the digital signatures of all of the Windows system files, and restores any that it finds are incorrect. It will use the on-disk cache, if possible, but SFC may require that you provide your original installation CD or a location with an image thereof.<br>  <br>  To run the system file checker, press Start, Run, and then type in SFC followed by its options.<br>  The most common usage of SFC is this SFC /scannow<br>  <br>  This causes SFC to scan your system immediately. SFC can take a few minutes to run. As I said above, have your installation CD or equivalent available in case SFC needs to replace a damaged file.<br>  <br>  While it's not documented anywhere, if SFC replaces any system files, I'd reboot. I just like to make absolutely certain that the file replacement actually takes effect.

If you experience slow downs at specific "high" volume times (i.e. when most people would be on-line surfing and downloading) then your ISP has not regulated enough bandwidth for the "node" you are connected to. There may be nothing you can do except call your ISP. Check your service agreement for what your rated speed is, if you are consistently not getting the speed you pay for then they need to be made aware of it.|`|8f550f3060c36d87c828fa62f0dd0540aa	You should use a download accelerator.

b9e2bb5a25c57cc333a03588822952e8aa	Underoath is a Christian band, so it makes sense they'd use 777 since the number seven has deep spiritual significance. It has been held sacred by the Hebrews and other Semite peoples since the dawn of time. It represents perfection and holiness. It is used throughout the Scriptures and in this sense is the Almighty's Number. We read of: <br>  Samson's seven locks of consecration. (Judges 16:13-19) <br>  The seven pillars of wisdom's house. (Proverbs 9:1) <br>  The sevenfold sign of total commitment and dependence (2 Chron. 29: 20-21) <br>  The seven lambs to attest the conclusion of a peace treaty. (Genesis 21:28-30) <br>  The seven fold sprinkling of blood before cleansing was complete. (Lev:16:19) <br>  The seven week count to Pentecost, the seven year count to the sabbatical year and the seven times seven year count to the Jubilee year. (Lev. 23:15, Lev.25:1-9) <br>  The seven candlesticks, seven churches, seven stars, seven seals, seven trumpets, seven thunders, and seven plagues mentioned in the book of Revelation etc. <br>  In addition to these examples, and there are many more, the Almighty has blessed each seventh portion of time in The Sacred Calendar:   the The Seventh Day of the Week,   the seventh year and also the seventh thousanth year period referred to by Bible students as the Millennium. Together with the Festivals of the God of Israel these all express the concept of totality, maturity, holiness and absolute perfection.|`|30f9141f2fff5f0d45e3a6c169a9e564aa	it is the opposite of the satanic number 666

Right now myspace is one of the most highly visited websites in the world, and the more traffic they have, the higher the chances of their servers temporarily crashing every now and then.

Si algunas de estas opciones no ayuda, prueba esto (puede que no sea útil, pero es mejor probar algo): si la opción de Windows Vista no da para formatear, dale a instalar el sistema operativo XP, dale a formatear (una vez que has hecho el backup de tus archivos), y en lo que puedas, instala el sistema operativo Vista desde cero. He de suponer que Vista no instala desde MS-DOS, por lo que debes prescindir del disco de inicio|`|VAF1OZKNaa	mira para formatear una compu con un sitema operativo nuevo es muy facil te lo dire en N pasos:<br>  <br>  1.-primero antes que nada te recomendaria que respaldaras todos tus datos ya sean en dvd, cds, o memorias usb, dado que una ves instalado el nuevo SO todos tus datos se abran borrado<br>  <br>  2.-ya que allas respaldado toda tu informacion mete el cd de instalacion en tu reproductor <br>  <br>  3.-hecho esto apaga tu maquina con el cd de instalacion adentro vuelve a encenderla segun tengo entendido aparecera a principio apenas la hayas prendido una pantalla azul o negra y te pedira que aprietes ta tecla no me acuerdo si es F5, F4 o F12 varia segun la marca o el modelo y hay una opcion que dice iniciar maquina con cd oalgo asi simplemnte le das enter a santo remedio<br>  <br>  OJO esto solo sucede en algunas maquinas si tu compu es recien comprada de 6 meses para aca bastara con que reinicies tu maquina y ella misma empesara el proceso de instalacion|`|a83f6ff3b3493928fecb092d9a62a9d4aa	mejor quedate con el xp, el vista tiene muchas fallas y es muy pero muy pesado...

Anyways, go to the Sell tab and enter in the info of the item. This is step by step so just follow the instructions. You can then describe the item, put up pictures, etc. Then you list the starting bid, a reserve price in case the item doesn't go as high as you wanted, or list a buy it now price (you can do this only if you have 10+ feedback) so someone can just instantly buy it. The list your shipping fee etc and then all you have to do is list your item.

KLrUwEv2aa	I advise you to steer clear of Norton... Use Avast or AVG instead.|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	Actually, you don't really need Norton. Save your pounds for something you really need.    Good security requires a multi-layered approach, and the least important layer by far is running some kind of anti-malware program (in fact, if you take care of all the other layers, you don't even need an anti-malware program using up extra resources).    In order of importance:    1. Create and use almost exclusively a limited user account instead of the default administrator account Windows sets you up with    2. Read up on social engineering and how to avoid it    3. Don't download illegal copies of software, music, or movies    4. Set Windows updates to install automatically    5. Make regular backups. If possible, back up your entire installation (using Norton Ghost or Acronis True Image)|`|2LbTrlQnaa	Norton is regarded by many as ineffective and also extremely difficult to totally remove if you decide you don't like it|`|af3a28b07826dce8ecfc28a5eaa91e13aa	Use AVG, it's free and just as good as Norton.

It has Firewall, Antivirus, Internet Security and many more features to protect you. Norton has bad reputation for being a slow antivirus and using lot of memory, but I think it is changing. If you really want Norton, then I'd suggest the new and latest one that came out, Norton Gaming Edition Antivirus. It is very, very silent.

AA10585364	What you want is to reformat your harddive, which reinstalls your operating system and you start off like you just got your laptop brand new. If you don't know how to reformat your harddrive and your not too tech savvy, get a knowledgable friend or a computer shop to do this or if you want, I can step by step it for you. You'll need to save the stuff you want on an external harddrive or else is will be deleted. <br>  <br>  If your laptop is a major brand (such as Dell, HP, Compaq, etc) and you saved the CD's that came with it, look for a "restore" CD. It will be easier than reformatting the harddrive since you basically pop in the CD and follow the steps.|`|WbUJkxPmaa	Format your hard disk... and install Windows XP or any operating system|`|1y9JzTcyaa	CAUTION:<br>  <br>  See if you have a directory called drivers on your laptop.

If you sleep or hibernate it will not continue to download. Your notebook should not overheat just downloading. If you have had overheating problems try blowing canned air through the notebook at its air intake (where the fan is on the bottom) and through the exit port to clear the dust out. <br>  You can set the screen to turn off early in the power settings area if you don't want it glaring at night.

5a86b8db4d927776b21409e2d0b91bffaa	All you have to do to get the kind of picture that you want. Is to put the two picture`s into gimp. And highlight the picture of the girl by left clicking on it and use the path tool to cut her out.The path is found in your tool box and it look`s like a pin. When you cut around the picture you will get some dot`s just click on the Ctrl button to close the path then click on select and in the drop down box left click on from path next to the red box. Then click on edit and in the drop down box click on cut. Then click on the eye next to the picture that has the girl in it to close the layer so gimp will not see it and you will not get confeused.then click on the picture that has the back ground that you want and highlight it. Click on edit and in the drop down box click on paste to put it in the back ground picture. You may have to re-size the picture of the girl to the size you want.If you have to re-size it to the size you want it. The re-size tool is the one that look`s like a square that has another square on the top Corner of  it then you use the move tool  to move the girl to where you want it in the back ground picture the move tool look`s like a cross. then click on the anchor icon at the bottom of the layer`s,channel to anchor it to the back ground picture.Then click on the layer that had the girl in it to highlight it and click on the box next to it to show the eye again so gimp can see it  and click on the trash can next to the anchor and deleat the picture that the girl was in before you cut her out .Then you can save your new picture.      I hope this can help you.

aXC7elejaa	FROM PG;s ow website:    Well, it is accurate in the sense that it blocks everything on your blocklist.   It is impossible to know _all_ the addresses to block    PeerGuardian is known to be incompatible with McAfee and BlackICE firewalls. Outpost is also known to cause a problem if you shut down PG2 while it is running. There is currently no way around this, so we recommend you try switching to another firewall    PeerGuardian blocked someone, should I be worried?  Well, it was blocked, so why would you worry?    PeerGuardian is slowing down my connection!  This occurs because of the way PeerGuardian blocks packets, not connections.    PeerGuardian is blocking an IP like crazy, should I worry?  PeerGuardian will constantly block IPs. Many times you will see IPs get blocked three or more times before giving up - this is due to the way most computers handle reliable connecting. After a period of time, people may retry to see if you are responding yet. This does not mean people are spying on you.     A block list is a list of bad IP ranges that are know to spy on peoples computers.        This software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied warranty. In no event will the authors be held liable for any damages arising from the use of this software.      Total of IP's being blocked right now:        * 2,377,645,666        first things first, if the government was and/or are spying on you right now, it will be on a IP range that is not on our blocklists and is a secret range of IPs, second thing is, if the government was and/or are spying on you right now, they would be doing it on a whole diffrent level.

tDxmzkGkaa	It's a format for media just like MP3 (MPEG-3) and WMV (Windows Media Video).|`|uuuPeGtTaa	MPEG-4 is a standard used primarily to compress audio and visual (AV) digital data. Introduced in late 1998, it is the designation for a group of audio and video coding standards and related technology agreed upon by the ISO/IEC Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) under the formal standard ISO/IEC 14496. The uses for the MPEG-4 standard are web (streaming media) and CD distribution, conversation (videophone), and broadcast television, all of which benefit from compressing the AV stream.<br>  <br>  MPEG-4 absorbs many of the features of MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 and other related standards, adding new features such as (extended) VRML support for 3D rendering, object-oriented composite files (including audio, video and VRML objects), support for externally-specified Digital Rights Management and various types of interactivity. AAC (Advanced Audio Codec) was standardized as an adjunct to MPEG-2 (as Part 7) before MPEG-4 was issued.<br>  <br>  MPEG-4 is still a developing standard and is divided into a number of parts. Unfortunately the companies promoting MPEG-4 compatibility do not always clearly state which "part" level compatibility. The key parts to be aware of are MPEG-4 part 2 (MPEG-4 SP/ASP, used by codecs such as DivX, XviD and 3ivx and by Quicktime 6) and MPEG-4 part 10 (MPEG-4 AVC/H.264, used by the x264 codec, by Quicktime 7, and by next-gen DVD formats like HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc).<br>  <br>  Most of the features included in MPEG-4 are left to individual developers to decide whether to implement them. This means that there are probably no complete implementations of the entire MPEG-4 set of standards. To deal with this, the standard includes the concept of "profiles" and "levels", allowing a specific set of capabilities to be defined in a manner appropriate for a subset of applications.

Mac<br>  * better quality hardware<br>  * more stable Operating system (based on Unix)<br>  * nice features like built-in web cam (for laptop)<br>  * you can NOW run windows programs with "Parellals" program<br>  * Less security issues/and updates required<br>  * Fast startup time<br>  <br>  I recently switched to Mac (3 months ago) after using windows for more than 10 years.  I don't regret it.|`|hIXvD59Iaa	Macs are better in graphics and editing and such. they are alot faster, last about 10 years longer, and have better models and they also have no viruses.

xCDLXAV1aa	What you’re asking can not really be answered. Torrentz.com is just a site that shows you available torrents for download. You can go to many different torrent sites to download the same torrent. When you’re downloading a torrent you’re downloading off other users (like me) your download speed should fluxuate depending on how many people are seeding and the connection on their upload speed. Not everyone seeding has fast connections. If a torrent is taking days to download try to find another torrent. It takes me about 1 day to download 2 or 3 gigs most of the time. (I download a lot of movies). Hope that helps.|`|DUfquUToaa	You go on a different torrent site?

Try doing some maintenance such as spyware removal or shutting down some of the stuff you have running.  Pressing ctrl+alt+delete will bring up the task manager.  Click on the Performance tab and see how much of your CPU and Memory is being used when you are multitasking.  You may want to even consider adding more RAM to your computer.

67d73c18e98f9a4187fddbdf8f58d1c8aa	This happens when your screen resolution is set to something higher than what your monitor can display. For example, if your monitor supports resolutions of up to 1024x768 and your video card allows you to crank it up to 1600x1200, doing so will give you an error. Another reason you might get the error is if the refresh rate you selected a certain resolution is higher than what your monitor supports. The monitor can't "sync" with the video card, so it just gives you that "Out of Range" error. If you are sure you have your resolution set at a reasonable amount, make sure that your monitor is plugged in all the way. Actually, if you're like me, that might be the first thing to check. =)<br>  <br>  If you are using Windows, hold down the F8 key while the computer is starting up and choose "Safe Mode" from the list of options that appears on the screen. This should force the display to be a low enough resolution so that it will work.

oZDz1Ipraa	A computer virus is a small program that infects a computer without the user permission. It attaches itself to other files and quickly multiplies.<br>  It is strongly recommended that you use an antivirus program on your computer and that you keep it updated. This will prevent any infection and clean your computer if it was infected previous to the install.<br>  <br>  You are infected with a virus if:<br>  <br>      * Your computer is very slow, stops responding, restarts or shuts down by itself from time to time.<br>      * Your hard disk or the removable drives (floppy drive, CD-ROM, USB Flash) are inaccesibles or the files are corrupt.<br>      * Unusual error messages appear.<br>  <br>  <br>  In case your computer got infected, try the following:<br>  <br>      * Get an antivirus program (if you don't have one already) See the Download antivirus page to get a free one.<br>      * Update your antivirus<br>      * Scan all your computer and delete, repair or quarantine the infected files.<br>  <br>  If you have problems in eliminating viruses from your computer, you can also try one of the free tools available in the Other download page.<br>  <br>  To keep your computer virus free:<br>  <br>      * Have an antivirus program and update it from time to time (some even update automatically)<br>      * Use a firewall.

When you play a game, it may use a lot of CPU, memory and of course Graphics power from your Video card (hopefully you do have a real video card and not a built-in crappy one like most brand name computers).  <br>  Open your PC's case and inspect carefully inside, expecially the heatsink for the CPU.  If you notice a lot of dust, this can cause system instablility by things overheating.   If you have a decent Graphics Card, check it's Fan/Heatsink for proper operation and dust build up.<br>  Your System memory could be flakey.  Take a stick out (assuming you have more than one) and try different combinations and try to duplicate your problem.

Make sure your drivers are up to date.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps...|`|AA10585364	Your computer is probably overheating. Is it starting to get hot in your area right now (I mean the weahther)? You might want to open up the side of the computer case and with a can of Dust Off gas duster, start spraying off the clumps of dust and other particles you see inside your computer case. Those dust trap heat and make the inside of your PC very stuffy. If you can, buy another computer case fan or two. Most importatnly is air circulation. Have at least 2-4 intake fans, positioned in the front or the sides and at least 1-2 exhaust fans, at the back or top of the computer case if that is allowed. Installing fans is a very cheap and easy upgrade to do.

Also another good utility to have is CrapCleaner. <br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, you'll probably want to reformat the harddrive.

Pressing the Scan button generates a log of dozens of items, most of which are just customizations. Don't check off an item and hit the Fix checked button unless you're sure it's malware. Clicking Info on selected item tells you why the entry was flagged as suspicious, but not whether it's actually malware.

u13cd20Qaa	yes its the same...<br>  if its showing a lower speed.. its because that Intel/ Amd has speed step/ cool n quiet technology<br>  <br>  what these both essentially does is to reduce the speed of the processor so that the heat can be reduced so that the power consumption is also reduces.. this is an endeavor of energy star systems optimization.....<br>  <br>  but that doesn't mean that you have reduced performance.. when you need the speed the most it revs up to the max.. or the level required...<br>  <br>  its now just like a car.. you dont have to race the engine every moment you are idling.. you can as well.. be quiet... <br>  so that the deal.. rev when you need....|`|ZIsFy7HXaa	Single core processors have a higher speed than the dual core...the dual core can process the same amount in less time without the higher speed...<br>  2.0 on a dual core will be overall faster than the 2.0 single core.|`|92TQh925aa	The term duo core means that you have 2 processors using the same socket.(one on top of the other) They are still running at 2.0GHz.<br>  So the ability for the processor to handle more functions has doubled, increasing the speed and efficiency of you PC.|`|0ewOlB0xaa	the duo basically means that you have two. Yes its much better coz when one is totally busy handling a task, the other is still free. in other words if you are doing a demanding task with a single processor then your pc would also be quite slow if yo wanted to do somthing else at the same time. with a dual core the second task will be as fast as if it was the only task.|`|AA10585364	A single core processor will provide you with up to 2ghz of speed. A dual core processor will have two dies on one chip, meaning two processors on one chip. That will result in speeds of up to 4ghz (2ghz x 2)
AA10585364	It could be either a hardware issue or a network issue (meaning comcast). Contact them for a replacement modem because you are experiencing connectivity problems and they should help you out. If that doesn't work, tell them to check out the network in your neighborhood to see if it's working properly. If that doesn't work, switch to a different internet carrier.|`|AA11485662	You should call Comcast and explain you have intermittent connectivity issues and ask for a technician to come to your house and take a look.  The tech can check signal levels and will be able to figure out if there are wiring or network issues or if the problem is with your modem.
aBvqrtIcaa	AMD has not yet come up with an "equivalent" to the Intel Core 2 Duo processor. The Core 2 Duo uses re-processing technology such that though it is running at 1.x Ghz only, its performance is that of a 3.x Ghz or more processor.<br>  <br>  AMD's 64 X2 processors are still running at the traditional technology and (therefore) rate of 3.x Ghz and above. AMDs current highest speed processors are those of the 64 X2 range of processors.<br>  <br>  I've compared the best and fastest of both and run a speed test (WinBench, WinMark, etc) and found that the Intel is faster by quite a bit (5-10%, depending upon the application). However, you are also paying more $$$ for the Intel so I guess you get what you pay for.|`|66db7c528e26e407b5f6829701d3a4c4aa	they are two marks different from processors and desicion is yours chooses the one that but you like IT I prefer AMD|`|AA10585364	That would be the AMD Athlon 64 X2 processors.
fWyExOXQaa	well for 1 thing upgrade your ram to a comfortable 1gig or 1.5 higher the better bro.  <br>  <br>  as for your graphics cards i am sure (being i'm a game developer) that your system will need an upgrade to play crysis, it's going to be very vram intensive from what i've witnessed.  video cards are a tossup as always.  <br>  <br>  i could point you to any consumer report and well they'll all generally say the same thing, the more expensive the longer it will last, as for graphics requirements for crysis ( i think that will be a little above the other 2 for now) you could very possibly need the best on the market to play it when it comes out.  <br>  <br>  i mean look at these...<br>  <a href="http://www.crysis-online.com/Media/Screenshots/Screenshots/Frozen-Action-05.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.crysis-online.com/Media/Scree...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.crysis-online.com/Media/Screenshots/Screenshots/Frozen-Wasteland-02.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.crysis-online.com/Media/Scree...</a><br>  <br>  minimum requirements for crysis (the new crytek engine that uses sandbox and the shader 2.0 thing)  states you need at least a 2.8ghz, and a radion x1600 so <br>  <br>  currently a radion X1650 Pro is going on AMD/ATI's website for roughly 200$ + s&h&tax&crap<br>  <br>  i'm really awaiting the crysis game also, but sadly in order for me or any other gamer (or developer) to enjoy it we need to pay $$$ out the rear to get the best effect but all in all crysis is one game i've waited over a year for release.  <br>  <br>  i hope this answers your question ( don't worry about the other 40 points i just enjoy answering questions)|`|FUbZU9hVaa	I don't have time to write it all out, but you can make a killer gaming pc for $800, expecially if that doesn't include OS.

You need to pick up a NVIDIA SLI approved PSU (power supply unit)  Based on the card, theres only a few motherboards capable of supporting SLI. Work with hardware keeping this in mind, you'll have a kick *** system worthy enough to play Supreme Commander, World of Warcraft among others.|`|AA11645722	Okay first off, we are not shopping at Best Buy because they overcharge, and we are close on the budget to begin with.  Here is the motherboard:<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128012" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  the RAM:<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231087" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  and the video card:<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814186016" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  But you also will need a new power supply to support that card, try this one:<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817341010" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  Lastly as for the processor, I am not sure whether that Celeron will work on the newer motherboards, it would depend on what socket it is, but it is pretty slow so you should probably get a new one anyway, this one here:<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115013" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  All totaled with the 3 things you asked for plus the power supply and processor it comes to $812, before some rebates.  Now some other people will probably recommend some stuff that is cheaper, and tell you to just keep your current power supply and processor, but remember you get what you pay for, and the stuff I have recommended will give you a good system.
AA11178545	You need to analyze the change and then study the impact of it. Here is when the change management plays a crucial role. You need to also look at the cost & Schedule impact and then decide accordingly. If you are a contractor then the thumb rule is that if the cost is less than 2% of the overall cost then you can absorb it and you will get a "good" name from your client. Remember it is easy to get a repeat business than a new business.

Reinstalling's the only sure way to know it's all gone.    Once you've done that, get some real security.    Good security requires a multi-layered approach, and the least important layer by far is running some kind of anti-malware program (in fact, if you take care of all the other layers, you don't even need an anti-malware program using up extra resources).    In order of importance:    1. Create and use almost exclusively a limited user account instead of the default administrator account Windows sets you up with    2. Read up on social engineering and how to avoid it    3. Don't download illegal copies of software, music, or movies    4. Set Windows updates to install automatically    5. Make regular backups. If possible, back up your entire installation (using Norton Ghost or Acronis True Image)|`|0EPkAWs9aa	While the trojan is freezing the system and blocks attempts to remove it, there's little sense in downloading any new security program. You can't be sure if you will be able to install it, update or even launch. Malware often protects itself quite aggressively.  So what you can do now.  1. Go to start, Run, type in MSCONFIG and click OK. Navigate to startup tab and uncheck boxes that refer to suspcious filenames. Or you may uncheck anything except for AVG & Windows defender.  2. Apply the changes and restart.  3. Download TrendMicro's HiJackThis.  http://www.trendsecure.com/portal/en-US/...  It's a little tool that empowers lots of functions. Do a scan with Log options, you'll get a Notepad file at the end. It can be posted on tech forums to get reviewed by advanced users.   4. Aternatively, you can try free online virus scanners that are able to remove detected infections. Be prepared to wait long before the scan finishes. There's quite a bunch of services available, I recommend BitDefender for a start,  but of course you may choose any.  http://hubpages.com/hub/Top-Free-Online-...

vWuvRB1Gaa	You could always buy a cooling base.    They work quite well and if you find a good one it will take down the temperature significantly.

Sem maiores complica??es, o Construtor de Sites auxilia na cria??o, produ??o e atualiza??o do seu site grátis com fácil acesso aos recursos e com uma interface simples de ser gerenciada, sem que haja a necessidade de se preocupar com quest?es técnicas de programa??o ou banco de dados.<br>  <br>  Se você procura algo profissional, recomendo que utilize uma empresa nacional e paga (+ ou - R$ 25,00/mês) .

Registro de domínio: <br>  <br>  domínio é o nome que se dá ao endere?o dos websites: Ex.: domínio.com (domínio americano) domínio.com.br (domínio brasileiro)No Brasil :Registro.br (site oficial de registros) faz o registro ao custo de 30 reais (até 2000 cobrava R$50,00 e até dezembro de 2002 cobrava R$40,00). O Servi?o de Registros de Domínio no Brasil é muito bom. Nota 10 para o Registro.br. Saiba mais visitando também o site do Comite Gestor da Internet no Brasil.Nos Estados Unidos:VeriSign (Usa a marca NetworkSolutions, que até alguns anos atrás detinha o monopólio de registros) ao custo de 35 dólares por ano registra domínios com extens?o .com, .net, .org, .biz, e.info. Você deve possuir cart?o de crédito. Hoje, porém, existem muitos outros organismos de registro, como Register.com, também a um custo de 35 dólares/ano. <br>  No site Godaddy.com você encontra um servi?o com excelente custo-benefício, um painel de controle que é provavelmente um dos melhores da internet, e registro de domíno a um custo de 8,95 dólares por ano. Vale a pena conferir! <br>  <br>  2. Constru??o do WebSite: <br>  <br>  Você pode usar o Netscape Composer  e conseguir bons resultados, ou ainda, se você já tiver prática do Composer, pode utilizar o Microsoft FrontPage ,  com muitos recursos de programa??o. A grande vantagem do Composer é que, além de fácil de usar, ele vem no Netscape Communicator (navegador), o qual pode ser obtido por download gratuito; o que n?o acontece com o FrontPage da Microsoft. Porém, a vantagem do FrontPage, é que você obtém resultados muito profissionais com ele. Outro software profissional é o Dreamweaver  com quase todos os recursos do FrontPage, porém, com o Dreamweaver você faz a publica??o de seu site via FTP e, consequentemente, você consegue acessar o seu diretório CGI. Com o FrontPage, jamais use conex?o FTP para upload, pois isso pode danificar as extens?es do FrontPage instaladas no servidor do hospedeiro do site. Para se decidir entre um e outro, você deve ver quais s?o mesmo suas necessidades, e é claro, verificar outras op??es no mercado.  Para incrementar seu site você pode usar softwares  como o PhotoPaint (editor de imagens da Corel) ou o  PhotoShop(editor de imagens da Adobe). <br>  Você também pode incluir Gifs Animados  no seu site: <br>  WebDeveloper  em inglês, com muitos gifs animados <br>  Clipart Connection em inglês, boa variedade <br>  WebImage em português, boa variedade  <br>  à medida em que você ganha intimidade com edi??o de páginas, vai querer incrementá-las mais e mais. Aí você vai querer JavaScripts, Applets, Perl,...: <br>  JavaScript Source em inglês, scripts do tipo copie e cole em HTML <br>  Cut and Paste  em inglês, como o próprio nome diz: do tipo copie e cole <br>  ZDnet também em inglês, mas com uma boa variedade de scripts gratuitos para sua página   <br>  Nos links abaixo, você consegue Flash Files: <br>  ScreamDesign  em inglês, muito bons arquivos flash  <br>  Flash Move em inglês, com vários links relacionados a flash   <br>  Um bom website deve conter um contador, visível ou n?o, de tal forma que você possa verificar, n?o somente o número de visitas, mas também algumas estatísticas interessantes sobre os acessos, tal como: visitas por dia da semana, por mês, país de origem dos acessos, tipo de navegador, etc... Um bom contador hoje você encontra pagando uma certa taxa. Alguns endere?os para conferir: (o site é em inglês) TheCounter.Com,  o  Superstats (que é da MyComputer.com), BCentral da MicroSoft (aliás, aqui você encontra muitos outros servi?os, como troca de banners), Stats4Your e StatCounter (este é gratuito). Na verdade, muitos dos sites de script de contadores da Internet que hoje cobram pelo servi?o (como os que mencionamos anteriormente), iniciaram seus trabalhos fornecendo estatística de gra?a. Ainda hoje, alguns sites mantém, além do servi?o pago, a op??o de fornecer, gratuitamente, um contador que lhe dá apenas o total de visitas, sem qualquer estatística, com a condi??o de que apare?a sua marca ao lado. Outra op??o para algo bem básico (somente o número de visitas) é o contador do próprio FrontPage.  <br>  <br>  3. Hospedagem: <br>  <br>  Após concluído seu trabalho, você deve colocá-lo no ar, ou seja, você precisa de alguém que tenha um servidor para hospedar seu site na internet, para que todo mundo possa vê-lo. <br>  Algumas empresas virtuais fazem isto de gra?a, à custa de colocar banner-adds ou pop-ups no seu site. As melhores op??es s?o o Tripod Brasil e GeoCities (da Yahoo). <br>  Se você puder investir de $10 a $20 por mês, vá buscar uma hospedagem profissional paga, pois dá credibilidade ao seu site. Você pode pesquisar algumas op??es nos sites de busca, com as palavras-chave: hospedagem e site. Nos sites de busca americanos, pesquise com as seguintes palavras-chave: host, site, low cost (se você quiser custo baixo). <br>  <br>  4. Cadastro em Sites de Busca: <br>  <br>  No Brasil: Cadê , Achei, Aonde, Radar UOL, Yahoo Brasil,  Terra, AltaVista Brasil Aten??o: em alguns destes sites, você terá que encontrar o link "indique um site", "sugira um site" ou ainda, "cadastre seu site", somente na se??o específica onde você quer fazer o cadastro. <br>  O Google faz a indexa??o automaticamente! <br>  N?o esque?a, também, dos gigantes Yahoo, Altavista, AOL, se você quiser publicar seu site pelo mundo.<br>    <br>  5. Dicas: <br>  <br>  Com alguma experiência, você pode conseguir alguns recursos poderosos para colocar no seu site, muitas vezes até de gra?a, como quadro de mensagens (bulletin board), fornecer e-mail grátis no seu site, salas de bate-papo (chat), etc. Confira: Freetools e Bravenet (em inglês) para ferramentas superinteressantes para seu site. O site Everyone.com (em inglês) oferece servi?o de email. O site BPath (em português) disponibiliza várias ferramentas como livro de visitas, banner, busca e enquete.<br>  Outros sites oferecem uma vasta gama de servi?os grátis na Internet: FreeWare (em português),  Servi?osGrátis (em português).<br>  Conhe?a a Internet: Glossário de Termos da Internet<br>  Conhe?a seu computador: Atalhos dos Teclados de seu Computador

k9LKQl5eaa	Due mesi sono troppi fidati è successo anche a me due volte: la prima era colpa delle poste in quanto avevano perso il pacco ( meno male che era assicurato ) la seconda era il venditore che mi ha gabbato....se non ti vuole dare la ricevuta di spedizione vuol dire che ti ha truffato.<br>  PS: se l' oggetto che hai acquistato ti è costato parecchi soldi fai una segnalazione ad e-bay ed una denuncia alla Polizia Postale del tuo paese.|`|0kMJF9WEaa	io ho atteso mesi ma poi è arrivato , nel peggiore dei casi ci sono problemi alla frontiera ma dato che il rivenditore è francese non dovrebbero essercene!|`|NkuuwW3paa	Ti consiglio di non comprare più da internet e non fidarti molto dei feedback, comunque aspetta ancora un pò se non arriva entro fine febbraio reclama.!!|`|jIXi8exdaa	2 mesi sono troppi se davvero da 2 mesi te l'ha inviato<br>  <br>  l'oggetto potrebbe essere stato smarrito dalle poste o lui non te l'ha inviato (credo più la prima).<br>  <br>  Chiedigli il rimborso o lasciagli un feedback negativo<br>  <br>  ciao!|`|jbYVhsrtaa	io ho aspettato 40 gg per una drive pen dalla korea(anche se era di marca inglese) ed 1 mese per dei giochi dalla malesia...in effetti dall'estero ci vuole un pò per le spedizioni|`|JZllqdeLaa	io per fortuna non ho avuto problemi di questo tipo...ho comprato un prodotto dalla germania ed è arrivato dopo nemmeno una settimana<br>  <br>  comunque è vero che alcune volte le poste italiane creano problemi<br>  <br>  dai speriamo ti arrivi anche se effettivamente l'attesa è molto lunga...
