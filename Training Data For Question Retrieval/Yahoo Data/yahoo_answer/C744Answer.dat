I make a packet and place it in the oven set at 350 for about 45 min, I use my toaster oven.  When it's done I take it out, open the foil and let it cool.  After I do that I start the soup.<br>  <br>  I peel and dice about 4 baking potatoes, and one large onion.  I start with the onion in the bottom of the pot with two tablespoons of butter and let them start to just turn golden, this takes about 10 min.  Then I throw in the potatoes and add enough water to just cover them. Add some salt, a tablespoon, and pepper bring to a boil uncovered.  I have used diced carrots in this before, and I have even put diced bacon or diced smoked ham in with the onions while they are browning.  This is a personal choice, you may not be a fan of the pork in your soup so it's just an option.<br>  Once the potatoes have started to sofen and it's getting thick give it a  stir and mash with your spoon, this will break up the potatoes further thickening your soup.  Now take that garlic you roasted earlier and sqeeze it out into a bowl and mash it up with a fork, then drop that into the soup.  Stir in some milk or cream or even better half and half (my mom and gran always throw in a stick of butter at this point, I however abstain), I never measure the milk I just add enough to make it a little more creamy.  Let that cook for two more min and turn off the heat.  Then stir in about half a cup of grated parmasan cheese.  Taste it and check for salt.  That is why you only add a little bit of salt in the beguining, the parm has salt and only after you add it can you really tell if it will need more.  This is my roasted garlic parmasan potato soup, and my family loves it.|`|jlKX6XfRaa	Leek Potato Soup<br>  <br>  Recipe courtesy Alton Brown, 2005<br>  <br>  Show: Good EatsEpisode: Sprung a Leek<br>  <br>      * RECIPE<br>      * COMMENTS & REVIEWS(102)<br>  <br>      *<br>        Cook Time<br>  <br>        1 hr 15 min<br>      *<br>        Level<br>  <br>        Intermediate<br>      *<br>        Yield<br>  <br>        6 servings<br>  <br>  Close<br>  Times:<br>  <br>  Prep<br>      25 min<br>  Inactive Prep<br>      --<br>  Cook<br>      1 hr 15 min<br>  Total:<br>      1 hr 40 min<br>  <br>  Recipe Tools:<br>  <br>      * Print Recipe<br>      * Get Card<br>      * Save Recipe<br>  <br>  x<br>  Select a Card Size<br>  <br>      * CARD3x5 card<br>      * CARD4x6 card<br>  <br>  x<br>  Add To My Recipe Box<br>  Add To<br>  Or Create New Folder<br>  <br>  Please limit to 20 characters<br>  <br>  Adding Recipe<br>  Adding Recipe<br>  <br>  Add Or Do Not Add<br>  <br>  Success<br>  <br>  This recipe was added to your Folder_Name folder.<br>  <br>  Do not show this message again<br>  Close<br>  x<br>  Add To My Recipe Box<br>  <br>  Please sign in to add this recipe to your Recipe Box.<br>  <br>  Sign In or Create your Recipe Box<br>  Ingredients<br>  <br>      * 1 pound leeks, cleaned and dark green sections removed, approximately 4 to 5 medium<br>      * 3 tablespoons unsalted butter<br>      * Heavy pinch kosher salt, plus additional for seasoning<br>      * 14 ounces, approximately 3 small, Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and diced small<br>      * 1 quart vegetable broth<br>      * 1 cup heavy cream<br>      * 1 cup buttermilk<br>      * 1/2 teaspoon white pepper<br>      * 1 tablespoon snipped chives<br>  <br>  Directions<br>  <br>  Chop the leeks into small pieces.<br>  <br>  In a 6-quart saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter.

Preheat oven to 325°. Line cupcake pans with paper liners; set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine flours, sugar, baking powder, and salt; mix on low speed until combined. Add butter, mixing until just coated with flour.<br>  <br>  2. In a large glass measuring cup, whisk together eggs, milk, and vanilla. With mixer on medium speed, add wet ingredients in 3 parts, scraping down sides of bowl before each addition; beat until ingredients are incorporated but do not overbeat.<br>  <br>  3. Divide batter evenly among liners, filling about two-thirds full. Bake, rotating pan halfway through, until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 17 to 20 minutes.<br>  <br>  4.

Thinly slice an onion and lay the slices over the lemon.

Have a backup location in mind as I suspect you'll run out of ways to pass the time there.  Maybe a quiet museum?
44f971d7ae1936193e159c0b3819760baa	That won't work, the cheeses will go clumpy and disgusting. Mozzarella does not have enough flavour for a cheese sauce. <br>  I would melt butter in a pan, stir in flour and cook it for a minute, then add milk bit by bit to make a white sauce then add grated cheddar. I'd season with s and p and a little mustard. Then I'd mix in the cooked macaroni and bake in the oven. I know that sounds complicated, but it is delicious. I put thinly sliced tomatoes on top of mine and they go all sweet and crispy. <br>  That's just the way I do it.|`|INPrlW6Maa	You need to heat up the milk and add the cheese to melt it, stirring well. THEN pour it over the noodles. And Yes the two cheese go well together.|`|AHhaLVQ8aa	i wouldn't mix them because as you know mozzarella cheese is very stringy when melted while cheddar melts down better
a1d5a62697a27a23c7c47a959f58ee7baa	Many cows are given hormones that force them to give more milk.<br>  <br>  Some dairy operators have resisted using the hormones, however. <br>  <br>  The hormones are sometimes called "Bovine Somatotrophin" and sometimes "Bovine Growth Hormone," or BGH.  <br>  <br>  The hormones were first developed by the American chemical company Monsanto, according to an article on this subject in Wikipedia, but the artificially engineered hormone and its trade name, "Posilac," where sold to Eli Lilly Co., which makes and sells the hormone now.<br>  <br>  I don't know about milk necessarily producting cancer.

It still seems to be used in the US, however.|`|HP1pToMOaa	Not in Cornwall.

They want to make as much money as possible whilst spending as little as possible. This means that they will resort to feeding their cows chemicals and additives and anything that will get them to produce lots of milk. This is common practice amongst farmers. <br>  <br>  Cows are often also fed meat (despite being vegetarian) and other chemicals to get them to fatten up and have lean, white meat when killed, which then sells well on the market. <br>  <br>  It's a sad practice, but the government will always be hesitant to do much about it as it's such big business and produces large sums of money, both for them and the economy.|`|RJpekNPfaa	Well this physician and working Harvard scientist has concerns:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2006/12.07/11-dairy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2006...</a><br>  <br>  And I think she would be more qualified than most Yahoo members. <br>  <br>  And you only have to look at this website to see that there are major concerns about milk and dairy in general:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.notmilk.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.notmilk.com</a><br>  <br>  So both sites are worth a read and then you come to your own conclusions.<br>  <br>  So maybe its not the actual milk causing the cancer, its the hormone residue in the milk that causes the cancer???<br>  <br>  So to avoid hormone residue, only consume certified organic or certified biodynamic dairy.<br>  <br>  .|`|f0ad6531ce43c9c2d656b52953c68bd7aa	Yes, the dairy industry is competetive and needs to make as much milk as possible, and they'll do it anyway necessary.<br>  <br>  No, milk doesn't cause cancer.

tFoFchuEaa	Having just the yolks makes the custard you're making thicker and richer. <br>  <br>  If you want to do something with the egg whites, whip them up with a dash of cream of tartar (tartaric acid) and some sugar and make meringues. Just look up a meringue recipe on the web.|`|flKkoiwbaa	Creme brulee is a custard, which uses yolks only.  <br>  <br>  Adding whole eggs will alter the texture of the finished product, because of the high protein content of the egg whites.<br>  <br>  If you like it with whole eggs, then by all means, enjoy.  However, I highly recommend that you try making creme brulee with the yolks only, just once.  You will find the result is much richer, with a creamier, silky texture.  Yum.<br>  <br>  By the by, egg whites freeze well, so if you use the yolks, throw the whites in a freezerproof container.  You can use them for other recipes, meringues, etc.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Just yolks does make a thicker creme brulee.

Put the flour in a plastic bag. One piece at a time, dip the chicken into the egg/milk mixture then add to the plastic bag. Shake the bag so that the flour is covering each piece of chicken. <br>  You can check to see if the oil is hot enough by sprinkling a little flour in the skillet. If it fries, it's hot enough!

Peanut oil, for deep-frying <br>  Directions<br>  In a large bowl or baking dish, whisk together 1 quart of the buttermilk, 2 tablespoons salt, 2 teaspoons of chile de arbol powder, or hot sauce, and a little bit of pepper, if desired. Add the chicken pieces, turn to coat, cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. <br>  Place the remaining 2 cups of buttermilk in a bowl. Stir together the flour, garlic and onion powders, paprika, and 2 teaspoons chile de arbol powder (or cayenne) in a large bowl. Divide flour mixture among 2 shallow platters and season generously with salt and pepper. Drain the chicken in a colander and pat it dry. Dredge the pieces a few at a time in the flour mixture and pat off excess, then dip in the buttermilk and allow excess to drain off. Dredge in the second plate of flour and pat off the excess. Put the chicken pieces on a piece of waxed paper or on a clean platter while you heat the oil. <br>  Pour about 3 inches of oil into a deep cast iron skillet; the oil should not come more than halfway up the sides of the pot. Put the pot over medium-high heat and heat the oil to 375 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Working in batches, add the chicken pieces to the hot oil, 3 or 4 at a time and fry, turning the pieces occasionally, until evenly golden brown and cooked through, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and transfer to a rack to drain; repeat to cook the remaining pieces. Serve hot. <br>  Yield: 4 to 6 servings <br>  <br>  Cheese and Dill Cornbread<br>   <br>  ? 3 cups all-purpose flour <br>  ? 1 cup yellow cornmeal <br>  ? 1/4 cup sugar <br>  ? 2 tablespoons baking powder <br>  ? 2 teaspoons kosher salt <br>  ? 2 cups milk <br>  ? 3 extra-large eggs, lightly beaten <br>  ? 1/2 pound (2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted, plus extra to grease the pan <br>  ? 8 ounces aged extra-sharp Cheddar, grated, divided <br>  ? 1/3 cup chopped scallions, white and green parts, plus extra for garnish (3 scallions)<br>  ? 2 tsp dried dill <br>  Directions<br>  Combine the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. In separate bowl, combine the milk, eggs, and butter. With a wooden spoon, stir the wet ingredients into the dry until most of the lumps are dissolved. Don't overmix! Mix in 2 cups of the grated Cheddar, the scallions and dill allow the mixture to sit at room temperature for 20 minutes. <br>  Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9 by 13 by 2-inch baking pan. <br>  Pour the batter into the prepared pan, smooth the top, and sprinkle with the remaining grated Cheddar and extra chopped scallions. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool and cut into large squares. Serve warm or at room temperature.

That type of steak (it's a good cut) doesn't need to be marinated. Nothing more than a good rubbing with garlic, then kosher salt, and cracked black pepper. And if you want to be extra adventurous, after searing both sides add a knob of butter along with a sprig of fresh rosemary. Spoon the butter over the top.|`|n20KiADxaa	You don't really need to marinate that type of steak. Simply rub a mix of garlic, rosemary or thyme (both is also great!), olive oil, salt, and pepper. The simpler the better. No need to cover up the meaty taste with a marinade!|`|xbzCxo8yaa	Beer!

2qbLrHBKaa	Yes, if there is meat it will spoil if it is left out. With cheese and vegetable, it will be fine left out for a day- day and a half but it will spoil much faster at room temp, just as cooked vegetables, sauce or meat would if it were not in bread|`|jlKX6XfRaa	They will keep better in the fridge because the lower temp helps retard petrification.

AA10606659	You might still be up for a party, everyone reacts a little different. When I take them I get a nice little energy boost, gets me motivated to do something. However; if you plan on drinking, I wouldnt eat em prior. Psychedelics for the most part,(in my experience) overpower anything else you may be on. Ive seen a guy that couldnt have weighed more than 120 drink over 8oz of straight liquor and still not feel drunk. Now of course his body was (he spent alot of time in the bathroom later), but mentally he "didnt feel it" I would wait and devote a whole day, mushrooms have a way of making their own plans, they dont really care what yours are :P|`|Scupj6XVaa	the first (and last) time i ever did shrooms messed with me bad... only do them if you are completely calm, and like the other answerer said in a happy environment.  dont do anything else with them... i was drinking and i couldnt even walk... someone had to  carry me to the bathroom.  it was bad|`|mSGG9UaZaa	Your mind is going to be tired as ****. You will not want to party. Having obligations with any shrooms in your system is just asking to burden yourself. Save them for a worry free day.|`|d74d0d57bf80db1a3f4d675531117d21aa	you will be exhausted because your body wants to fight off the mushroom's poison. Mushrooms are psychedelic because of the poison. That's why some people sleep when they eat them. You will be tired and feel like a zombie because your body is trying to process the poison, that's also why it is not recommended to drink alcohol when eating psychedelic mushrooms because it makes the liver work hard.  Eat lots of vitamin C.|`|2fW267GMaa	I've done that same thing you are planning in the past without a hitch, but then again everyone is different.  I don't know how experienced you are with psychedelics but as others have suggested unless you know how you are going to react then devote an entire day to the shrooms.  The only problem I ever have when I plan to do something later that day is that I constantly think about the coming event and it can mess with the trip.  This is just my experience.  Just remember to be safe.|`|9531a5e374db145835852e9715fc4e49aa	It depends on how strong the shrooms are.  You won't want to go to sleep most likely, but a lot of the times you'll be worn out from the trip.  <br>  <br>  Plus mixing other drugs while the shrooms are still in your system (even if you may not feel the affect of them anymore) is a gamble.  So drinking alcohol or smokin some pot, could make you sick.  I'd recommend just holding off the shrooms until you have a clear day to do them.|`|J1Yv4hLsaa	It depends on how much you take, but I would advise against doing them prior to partying.  Shrooms can be a very draining experience and you will most likely be tired afterward which will kill any chance of having a good time at the party, (this is not due to poison as someone said earlier, honestly aspirin holds a higher toxicity than shrooms) not to mention that they will last AT LEAST 6 hours, they may last 12.  Long story short, devote a day to the shrooms in which your plan is to nap afterward, not party.  It'll be a better experience.|`|8ZVrAl2Zaa	Yeah man, you gotta be in a good mood, or you will have really bad trips. Get  alot of sleep before and make sure you're okay : D<br>  And yeah good luck : D<br>  <br>  PS It's just better to save the shrooms for another day... Something bad could happen|`|4xBBrPitaa	Every body and mind reacts a little differently to shrooms. If it is your first time, make sure you are with some friends and in a "happy" environment. The symptoms could last few as long as a day striaght. Be prepare and think happy thoughts.

AA10249078	A lot of it depends of the individual who has consumed the meat. Personally, I know that if I eat meat that is just starting to go bad, I can usually tell within 30-60 minutes after eating. Sometimes the effects will be quite painful, others times not so bad.<br>  <br>  However, another person can eat the same meat I've eaten and not have any ill effects.  That's why I say the length of time to see effects from eat meat that has gone bad can vary person-to-person.|`|n20KiADxaa	Funny, bc we just talked about that in my health class.

AA10797066	There's this one new site that can explain that quite a bit. It has a lot of info about different herbal tea recipes, which herbs have what medicinal properties, what certain herbs do for your health, etc. - it's just started and slowly expanding, and you can put in requests for new herbs/recipes in the form at the base of the page. Lots of links to other herbal healing sites in the text as well. The link that's posted whenever you see "let's make some tea!" is also a huge resource of make-your-own herbal tea goodness as well!|`|6eee3c0b647347e08b85c17f1991c44eaa	I know one type of tea doesn't have any caffiene, Black Tea I believe. Green tea is good because it curves your appetite. That is why you see it in most diet pills. Take a look yourself! ;)|`|Zbh768J5aa	well, green tea contains lots of antioxidants which can benefit your health in many ways, including reducing the risk of cancer. the thing about green tea, is that it can speed up your metabolism, which means you will burn calories faster than usual. normal tea does not have any of these health benefits and it does not speed up your metabolism and help you to lose weight like green tea does.|`|Kg2bRyVCaa	Mostly the difference is in the way the tea is processed. Different processing techniques have different results, and some teas will have a different flavour or benefits as a result of being processed differently. <br>  <br>  WuYi tea for instance, is dried out in a way that preserves the anti-oxidants. This might account for the claims that it helps you to lose weight.

cddac97d16e342e4a73cf2d576630e1baa	This is like a Mediterraneann of pasta that substitutes with the squash, easy, healthy, and economical    Greek Spaghetti Squash  1 spaghetti squash, halved lengthwise and seeded   2 tablespoons vegetable oil   1 onion, chopped   1 clove garlic, minced   1 1/2 cups chopped tomatoes   3/4 cup crumbled feta cheese   3 tablespoons sliced black olives   2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil     Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.   Place spaghetti squash cut sides down on the prepared baking sheet, and bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a sharp knife can be inserted with only a little resistance. Remove squash from oven, and set aside to cool enough to be easily handled.   Meanwhile, heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Saute onion in oil until tender. Add garlic, and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, and cook only until tomatoes are warm.   Use a large spoon to scoop the stringy pulp from the squash, and place in a medium bowl. Toss with the sauteed vegetables, feta cheese, olives, and basil. Serve warm.|`|Scupj6XVaa	I saute a little garlic in some olive oil and after the squash is cooked toss it in there and cook for a few minutes... it is sooo delicious!|`|TUNvbXbgaa	A spaghetti squash recipe with ground beef.

So breakfast means breaking the fast.|`|kT8rhVdLaa	Breakfast is the first meal of the day.

Its so much better for the animals than not eating meat at all. Free range means the cows, pigs, chickens and any animal roams free in fields. The meat tastes nicer and you know it has a nicer life. I don't really have a problem with it being in the UK and if you are then you wont either but if not then it might be harder to find. Also vegetarians can get diseases because of deficiances, its natural to eat meat, we have canine teeth.|`|rrWhhiMEaa	I would suggest trying to do it a little slowly rather than an "all or nothing" approach (unless that type of thing works well for you). If you are used to eating a lot of meat, it may be hard initially to stop completely. <br>  <br>  I don't like using the fake meat products, and I would try to limit dairy products as well. Be careful not to eat too much carbs and sugary stuff like breads,  cookies, crackers, just because they are vegetarian doesnt make them healthy.<br>  <br>  Try adding in vegetables to things you would normally eat. Put veggies in your pasta sauce and not meat. A grilled portobello(marinated) instead of burger or chicken sandwich. Throw beans into everything, soups, salads, pasta, rice. Use herbs and spices to make veggies flavorful. Eat whole grains. They have more nutrients and keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  Have fruit smoothies for breakfast. Just blended banana and frozen fruit, you dont even need to sweeten it.

Cook with olive, coconut, and palm oils.  <br>  <br>  Eating hemp seeds provides Omega-3 and Omega-6 fats in proper ratio, along with all the essential amino acids (proteins), they are available at Whole Foods, The Vitamin Shoppe, and many other health food stores.|`|5UxQVmekaa	Well i have have been a veg head for 4 years going on 5.

If you are really into going vegeterian and you will stick to it with will power, then go for it. Although, if it is for your health do you think it is a good move? The human diet is supposed to be made up of meats, carbs, vegetables & fruits etc. Supplements to these products is not natural (although what is in nowadays).

6nO14vOkaa	nothing make sure you brush your teeth after vinegar is good for your body God bless you|`|AAgX0SDcaa	Vinegar has a homeopathic effect on your body's Ph balance. Even though vinegar is acidic it will balance your Ph. Eating too much meat, dairy products, fats and sugar will cause your Ph to become overly acidic, and when that happens your body will take calcium from your bones to balance it. So perhaps you are craving it as a way to balance your Ph. It is very healthy to eat it with fried foods, it helps prevent or alleviate heartburn caused from eating fried foods or too much fat in other foods.  You should rinse your mouth very well after consuming vinegar, the acid will erode the enamel on them if you don't. Other than that it is very safe to use.|`|coXpFm7Haa	I don't think it is bad for you at all. As far as why your body is craving it maybe try some health sites. <br>  Maybe you just like the taste.<br>  maggiec645|`|s4WywJ8baa	If you have too much... an ounce an hour is what your body can process, you can do a lot of damage to your liver and kidneys.<br>  <br>  There is a reason for this. Vinegar is a fermented product. Just like alcohol and chocolate. Too much is bad for you.<br>  <br>  But at the levels you are taking it in you are in no danger. You are just worrying to much. You probably crave it because you like the taste.|`|4UXJoMbKaa	Vinegar is actually fairly good for you. Sometimes your body craves good things like this. However, instead of always turning to vinegar, perhaps you could try something else sour to satiate your craving-like fruit. Cravings often mean we are deficient in something, so perhaps your body is telling you it needs more acid in your diet.<br>  :)
Hx0a0Q8Uaa	Many things! <br>  <br>  1. Macadamia oil is prized for containing approximately 22% of the Omega-7 palmitoleic acid which makes it a botanical alternative to mink oil, which contains approximately 17%. This relatively high content of "cushiony" palmitoleic acid plus macadamia's high oxidative stability make it a desirable ingredient in cosmetics, especially skincare.<br>  <br>  2. Ten to 12 macadamia nuts deliver about 200 calories and 20 grams of fat, but they are also very low in carbohydrates therefore making them great for a low carb diet. <br>  <br>  3.

cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	I am a former chef and had it in both France and when I worked in Singapore, now there is not the same amount or types of cuts that come off a beef cattle, mostly it is the striploin and tenderloin and there older mature horse, not the ones that are from the Racetrack, most are older farm animals or breeder stock, flavour wise it is very similar to a beef steak, a bit milder in flavour, not as fatty, but overall you could not ell if you were not told, now there is some ground in Singapore used for an Indian meatball like curry dish called kofta, it is listed as Kofta Clip-Clop curry, just kidding.|`|T6d1NOwMaa	Marinate it overnight otherwise it is tough. Use a cast iron pan as well.<br>  Bon appetite!!|`|Fb5YtlkEaa	Horse meat is very very lean and has a stronger flavor than common western meats like cow, chicken etc. Horse meat, I find, is slightly sweeter. However Horse meat varies greatly on age depending on the age, preparation of carcass and method of cooking.<br>  <br>  A proper cut should be from a young animal no older than 4 or 5 that has not worked in its life, ate only forage and was killed when healthy and not sick. The loin is one of the most used cuts. The meat should be very tender, any fat should melt in your mouth like butter and it should have a very good, 'meaty' flavor. <br>  <br>  Now depending on who prepares it or what country will determine the flavors. South American is a nice blend, Canadian as well although Candian horse meat is often cut from old animals that were not raised for slaughter and contain several harmful chemicals from the use of products on regular horses. Middle eastern meat is good as well although other parts of the dish may dominate the flavor. China and Japan is usually consumed with hotter or salty flavors while German and Russian flavors are very traditional but use very different cuts. <br>  <br>  If you going to try it got for Argentinian horse meat from the loin. A properly raised animal is delicious and you will enjoy your meal, while poorly cared for animals have a bad taste (more so in horses than other animals like cattle although I do not know why this is)|`|DPtxg6YJaa	Gross -_-

My ideas aren't very fancy, but really, kids would eat dirt if it was shaped like a dinosaur, so save your budget and your back with these easy, fun meals that are nutricious and tasty for every body.<br>  <br>  <br>  1. Sloppy Joes. A little hamburger, some sloppy joe sauce (can buy it for a buck at a grocery store) on hamburger rolls, with buttered corn on the cob. It's messy, but all the mess stays on the plate, it delights kids, and it's very inexpensive!<br>  <br>  2. Spaghetti bowls. Make some pasta (spaghetti or rigatoni or something) and drain it; add the sauce directly to the pasta and let it sit for a few minutes; the sauce will steam-cook with no splatters. Add some toasted covered with butter and garlic and tuck it in the bowl with the spaghetti.<br>  <br>  3. Pork'n'beans. Better than it sounds! Take some porn'n'beans (can find cans of them by Campbell's in your soup isle) and add cut-up hot dogs. It's surprisingly tasty and goes great with mac and cheese (my favorite is the shell kind in the box) and broccoli or peas or lima beans.<br>  <br>  4. Chicken casserole bake. Prepare some chicken and cook it the way you like best; then boil some pasta, drain, and add to a casserole dish with cans of cream of chicken soup. Add cut or torn-up pieces of the chicken, cheese, peas, carrots, and any other vegetables you like I always liked it with broccoli. :)<br>  <br>  5. Egg sandwiches. Cute for dinner; just scramble some eggs and serve on toasted bread with cheese; add bacon or ham if you want. You can also serve it alongside some applesauce, or cut up, fried potatoes.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck, hope this helps!|`|23c99fcd4aa2aac54a97abdb713c5f5eaa	check out the campbells soup website recipe section.

4d80afe3510fcec9f8c8cce72cafd379aa	If it's not spreading it's too thin.  Add some more water, but just a tiny bit at a time until it's where you want it.  If it's running off the cookie it's too thin and you need to add a little bit more confectioner's sugar (icing sugar is the same thing).

AA10265913	Here you go, a little pipe smoking 101.<br>  Find a pipe that fits you. There are many tobacconists around the world who would be more than happy to help you find the perfect pipe. Prices range from six dollars to several thousand. <br>  Find the right tobacco for you. There are many varieties: aromatics, American blends, English blends, Virginias, Burleys, and many more. A tobacconist will be able to help there, as well. People completely new to smoking may enjoy an aromatic or lighter strength tobacco, while someone coming from cigarettes or cigars might prefer a heavier type of blend. Buy small amounts representing several different genres. <br>  Fill your bowl. Fill loosely with tobacco and compress it lightly. Compressed halfway from the bottom of the bowl to the top. Fill again to the top and compress with a little more force. This time halfway from the top of the previous packing to the top. Now top it off and compress a bit harder. Again half way from the last point to the top. Should leave roughly a 1/8th of an inch gap from the tobacco to the top of the bowl. You need to make sure it is not so tight that you cannot draw through it; you should be able to draw air though with little or no resistance. The tobacco should be springy to the touch. It's best to have your tobacconist or an experienced pipe smoker show you. Correct packing takes a little practice, and has a lot of impact on how enjoyable your experience will be. <br>  Light the pipe with a wooden match or a pipe lighter. Let the match burn off the sulfur a few seconds. Move the flame around the surface of the tobacco while drawing gently until evenly lit, then tamp gently with a tamper. Let it go out, then relight the same way. <br>  Puff slowly and rhythmically. Patience is rewarded. Puffing too fast will result in tongue bite - a burning sensation on the tongue. <br>  Tamp the tobacco gently periodically throughout the smoke to ensure the bowl remains correctly packed while smoking. Don't worry if the pipe goes out from time to time - it will. Simply relight, after the pipe has cooled. <br>  Make sure you smoke your pipe to the end to create a nice "cake" at the bottom and side of your pipe bowl. <br>  Relax and enjoy. Pipe smoking is the quintessential art of smoking. <br>  <br>  Get support. There are a lot of great forums out there and great people to help you discover this wonderful hobby and pastime. Many give up from lack of answers to some of the simplest questions. We are out there and we love to help. <br>  Above all, be patient, and take things slow. For most, the pipe smoking experience isn't pleasant until skills in packing, lighting, tamping, and smoking cadence are mastered, and you've found some tobacco blends and a pipe that suit you. Tongue bite means you're doing something wrong. If you don't like it at first, keep experimenting, and discuss your new hobby with experienced smokers. <br>  Keep a pipe cleaner handy. At the first sign of moisture coming through the stem of the pipe, stick the pipe cleaner into the stem and let it absorb any condensation. <br>  If the pipe gets hot, let it go out and cool down. Smoking a pipe too hot won't taste good, and it may damage your pipe and/or your tongue. A good guide as to whether your pipe is too hot is if you can't hold the bowl against your cheek comfortably then let it cool down. <br>  Allow briar pipes time to rest between smokes - the consensus is at least a day. Consider adding some corn cob pipes to your rotation while you build your collection of briar pipes. A meerschaum pipe is a great investment due to their smoking quality and the fact that they don't need to rest between smokes. <br>  Avoid buying the cheap "basket" or department store briar pipes. A corn cob pipe will smoke much better than a cheap briar, and cost much less if finances are a problem. <br>  Never buy a metal (brass or silver) pipe. They look very unusual and striking but remember - metal conducts heat. These are for show. You will seriously burn yourself with these. <br>  Allow a nice cake to grow in the bowl of the pipe. This protects the bowl from cracking. After a while, it will become necessary to scrape some of the cake off, but you may want to consult your tobacconist about that. <br>  Whenever you are finished with a pipe, allow it to cool and then polish it using pipe polish and a clean, lint free cloth. This helps to preserve the shine and appearance, as well as protecting the bowl from heat, dirt, and corrosion.|`|zU1jHBvuaa	wow pipes are well cool i want one<br>  i actually have no idea tho, sorry<br>  dont u jst put the tobacco in the end and light it then suck it?<br>  XOXO|`|pVbrHX0xaa	you are not permitted to smoke a pipe until you become a grandfather, carry a hip flask, wear a bowler hat, play snooker and wear pyjamas to bed.|`|PC3zDev1aa	Take the tobacco bud and put it on top of the screen in the pipe.

vv2uk9hHaa	No coffee is not in any way "bad" for children. It does cause a little trouble for calcium absorption in the gut, but by adding some milk to you coffee it more than counteracts those effects. Coffee is actually good for the brain, and studies have shown that in can prevent lots of diseases like Alzheimer's' and Parkinson's'. Do be prepared to deal with kids who will be a lot more "awake" and energetic though. Just don't give it to them any later than 6 hours before bedtime though. Think of it this way.. Children eat chocolate all the time, right? The active ingredient in chocolate is theobromine. That molecule is exactly the same as caffeine, but with one more H atom. So...  they're already exposed to something almost as potent as caffeine all the time. And don't worry, coffee doesn't "leach" out vitamins or anything, like some uneducated people are wont to say.|`|6mm0lEWraa	I've been having it since I was 12 & am 17 now<br>  <br>  It hasn't affected me but If I don't have at least 3 cups a day I get really pi'ssed lol - think im addicted|`|4jqNWRAuaa	Coffee has, up until recently, gotten a bum rap by the medical establishment  . The tendency has been to focus on caffeine as if that were the only substance in coffee--there are over 800 components, including many antioxidants  . Early theories held that coffee causes cancer and increases heart attacks and some early poorly done epidemiological studies that failed to control for smoking found such an association  . But this thinking was wrong. Unfortunately, it persists. <br>  <br>  Almost all of the more recent better done studies show that coffee has lots of health benefits  . It is good for the liver, helps control diabetes, may help asthma, and may ward off Parkinson's disease. An area where there appears to be a paucity of good research is to compare types of coffee and brewing methods. Researchers have often compared green tea to black tea and have found that green tea contains more antioxidants. Coffee contains antioxidants as well, but I'd bet that freshly roasted espresso contains more antioxidants than drip brewed Folgers. It would be interesting to see researchers examine this. One wonders whether it could it even have something to do with the Mediterrean effect. <br>  <br>  Finally, comparisons between coffee and cola are ridiculous. Both have caffeine, but there the similarity ends. Cola is filled with refined sugar (actually now high fructose corn syrup) and has no nutritional value. I'd much rather my kid drank coffee than Coke. Here is a link to an article that (toward the bottom) looks at the possible health benefits of coffee for children: <br>  <br>  "In fact, no studies show that coffee in reasonable amounts is in any way harmful to children."|`|RoBBArMeaa	i don't think it's bad. only because my parents introduced me to coffee when i was 12 because i was very curious. now i'm 17 and i have been gracefully drinking a cup every morning :). i have you know though, i'm kind of addicted but i know that i don't do more then a cup a day.|`|6n3TY0Xdaa	Coffee is not a bad thing.Some coffee has antioxidants in it.Overall coffee has a lot of caffeine in it for children to be drinking it.|`|D9DIEk8naa	ive been drinking it since i was 10 im17 now  brain dead and constantly shaking  so yes it might be|`|GgACsJ5kaa	yes, because they can get addicted 2 the coffee nd wen they miss a day of coffee they will get dizzy nd hav a head ach<br>  plus it has caffine so children will get hyper and even gain weight<br>  coffee wont let children grow<br>  for children its best 2 drink milk and water|`|DRKxZEpJaa	well if u want them to become hyper and everything then ya but if u want them calmer than when they drink coffee then no|`|ABgwPfR7aa	i've heard it can stunt growth
aNlT1NRqaa	Two things to do:<br>  1) Cut down on the coffee. I love coffee, but I limit how much I drink.<br>  2) Drink more water. Drink a glass before the coffee & sip some more while your drinking. Coffee actually dehydrates you & that can cause some of your symptoms (or make them worse).<br>  <br>  You could also try decaf or 1/2 decaf. As long as it's good Arabica coffee, it tastes like regular. I do that when I'm making a large batch.|`|vv2uk9hHaa	You can't. Your body goes through withdrawal. Same as if you were a drug addict. The only thing that will prevent the symptoms is to use an alternate source of caffeine (like strong tea, wake-up pills, soda, etc...). But then you're just taking the same substance anyway. If you want to quit, well...... You'll have to suffer the withdrawal. Don't worry though, it only last about 2 or 3 days and it won't kill you. You could gradually lower your daily consumption of coffee though and start to mix your coffee grind with decaff (raising the percentage of decaf every few days until it's only decaf) and then you'll be fine and you won't have a physical addiction to caffeine anymore. It'll be a slow withdrawal, you'll have less symptoms.|`|PxVDtnSzaa	Yes...<br>  Caffeine!

Make sure to stir constantly to prevent sticking. (I prefer to use the double boiler method and if you don't have one, use a homemade version which works perfectly. Fill a stainless skillet halfway with water and set the sauce pan of mixture inside the skillet. This keeps the mixture from over cooking and provides the type of texture you want.) Continue to stir constantly. <br>  Mixture should develop into a smooth texture.<br>   After mixture is done, peel and slice the bananas. <br>  Grab a glass bowl and start the layering process. <br>  Start with cookies on bottom, then sliced bananas on top of the cookies. <br>  Pour some mixture over the bananas. <br>  Then start another layer of cookies, then bananas, then more mixture. <br>  Continue this process until you've used all the mixture.<br>   Top with cookies.<br>   Put in refrigerator to chill for a few hours, then ENJOY!|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Canned banana pudding (you can make it with a package and milk)<br>  cool whip<br>  nilla wafers<br>  banana slices<br>  <br>  fold in cool whip and bananas to pudding, line dish with wafers, spoon in pudding, decorate with extra cool whip and banana slices|`|5W5aE3MMaa	if its golden corral than chances are the recipe is open can with can opener and serve.  he will be just as happy if you bought him a banana pudding mix and made it for him.  making a creamy smooth pudding isnt extremely easy if you haven't made pudding before.|`|f262cda35c3c0959f3b4089b38f0359faa	Just go buy it from them.

You are unlikely to get alcohol poisoning this way, and will blackout the end of the night.  <br>  <br>  The fastest way is obvious.  You drink a lot of alcohol very quickly.  Start with liquor and drink a lot of it, maybe half a bottle.  An hour later, start taking shots.  This way is really dangerous.  You can easily drink too much and go beyond blackout drunk and reach, say, alcohol poisoning, coma, or death without realizing until it is too late.<br>  <br>  Now, if you want my advice, I would suggest you have maybe 3 or 4 drinks.

However, they knew I would do it with, or without their permission - and they'd certainly rather I did it in a house rather than out on the streets.<br>  Looking back, yes it was too young to be drinking, and I understand that now. But us nagging you about that probably won't change your mind about it. Don't bother lying to your parents. You'll just get in more **** when you get taken home wasted (will probably happen sometime). Be honest, but ask them to give you the benefit of the doubt. One chance. Don't blow it ;)

Q5BM2POnaa	The names silver (real name blanco) anejo and the one in between you didn't mention; reposado all refer to the aging.<br>  <br>  Blanco (sometimes called silver in the US) has no aging, and thus it's totally clear.<br>  <br>  Reposado (sometimes called gold) is minimally aged, anywhere from 2 months to 18 months, and is kind of goldish brown in color.<br>  <br>  Anejo is heavily aged, anywhere from 18 months on up to 5 years or more in the case of some of the ultra-anejos such as Patron Platinum.<br>  <br>  Generally speaking, the longer the aging, the smoother the flavor, the darker the color and the more expensive.<br>  <br>  If you're slamming a shot, just do the blanco as you won't get to enjoy the flavor anyway.  If you want to be a true tequila conisseur, skip the slammed shots and sip a nice anejo neat (no ice, lime or salt).  <br>  <br>  If I'm choosing, it's always anejo.<br>  <br>  -------------------------<br>  <br>  Rockstar's answer is actually correct for some low grade tequilas (such as most types of Cuervo and Sauza).  But she still gets a thumbs down for suggesting her statement is true for Patron.  Her statement is just not true with any tequila labeled 100% agave.  Food coloring (which in cheap tequila's case is caramel color (basically sugar)) is not legally allowed in 100% agave tequilas, of which Patron is one.  <br>  <br>  Do avoid junk like Cuervo Gold or Black which do add caramel coloring to darken them.<br>  <br>  Tracey, on the other hand, gets a thumbs up as Cabo Wabo is actually a superior tequila to Patron.  Patron is not bad by any means; it's just over-hyped and over-priced.  Throw in some rap star endorsements and a lot of expensive billboards and you can create the illusion you are the best tequila out there.  In reality, there are many tequilas better than Patron, and most of them even cost less.|`|MzixfZKcaa	here's a secret that Patron doesn't want you to know.

KWhKwgsSaa	The salt keeps it moist and tender.  Not sure about the recipe the fellow on Leno used, but here's one:    Ingredients:  1/3 cup olive oil  1/4 cup minced onion  1 teaspoon garlic salt  1 teaspoon dried basil  1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram  1/2 teaspoon dried thyme  1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper  3 pound whole chicken  3 pounds kosher salt  1 1/4 cups water    1.  Combine oil, onion, garlic salt, basil, marjoram, thyme, and pepper in a heavy plastic bag; mix well. Add chicken; coat well with marinade. Marinate in refrigerator 2 hours or overnight.  2.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line roasting pan with aluminum foil.  3.  Combine kosher salt and water to form a thick paste. Pat 1 cup paste to a 1/2-inch thick rectangle in pan. Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Place chicken on salt layer; pack remaining salt paste around outside of chicken to seal well. Bake for 1 1/2 hours, (Steam may cause crust to crack slightly.) Remove from oven; let stand 10 minutes. Remove and discard salt crust.|`|DMhAPurkaa	You can do this with fish also.  You don t eat the salt if we are talking about the same recipie.  It is a crust ; it s purpose is to seal in the juices.Egg white,  whip it up, smear on the chicken or fish.   Place meat in roasting pan.  You can put lime, lemon and orange slices on top of meat, or chopped garlic .  Pour Kosher salt all over the meat till completely and thickly covered.Bake in hot oven 425 for about 50 minutes.  Take out the meat, and there will be like a "cast" of slat...  tap on that to break open the crust and lift out the meat.   It will not have a nice brown look as in other cooking methods, but it will be pale-ish but very moist.  You throw away the salt crust.  Use some brightly colored veggies with it because it is so pale.  Hope this is the recipie you were thinking of.|`|vcgn6XZgaa	No, but all that fat and salt would not be good for you!|`|hT8vbWiDaa	Spice the chicken to bake as you normally would (rosemary, sage, etc...) and exclude the salt.     Get cooking quality rock salt. Lay a bed of it in your oven dish, lay the chicken (or fish or roast beef) in the middle and cover with salt. Needless to say that the dish must have relatively high sides. Bake (time & heat) according to the weight of the piece of meat. When done, remove, let cool 10 minutes and the crack the salt shell. Remove the meat and place on a serving dish. This is cool to bring to the table, crack the shell... then take back to the kitchen (or right at the table) to remove the meat and carve.

When making ice cream, one of the most important things is that it is moving or "churning" as it is freezing. That is why if you were using an ice cream machine you would put it into the frozen canister and churn it. If you can somehow figure out a way to churn the ice cream as it is freezing (as in, keeping it agitated) you could end up with ice cream however as said before...takes alot of work and most likely isnt worth it.

c9a1b864f1a97925067a5a7737860ac4aa	Hi Cassandra:    It is very difficult to cut these things if you try to cut them down the middle.  Cut it the other way,  1) First, cut off the narrow part of the squash and then cut that part in half.  2) Then go back to the wide part of the squash and put the cut side down on the cutting board and cut right down the middle of it.  3) Then you can scoop out the seeds.  BTW.  A chef's knife is the best thing for this squash.  Blessings.|`|hT7BhNamaa	Cassandr, I am sitting here laughing at JC's answer, she is right and on the money with her answer. However, to stabilize your cutting so you don't cut yourself, take a bit off the bottom, and the top were the stalk was. Stand it up cut it half, scoop out the seed, now cut the two halves in half again and peel, I use one of those potato peelers to save my hands and fingers from band aides.    Chris|`|829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	lol!  Your not getting to old.  Frustration is giving the squash the upper hand here.  The squash must know that you are the boss.  Calm down and make believe that it's not a squash but a cantaloupe.  Cut it in half first, remove the seeds, then peel it.  If the recipe is calling for pieces, it may be easier to peel smaller pieces then larger ones( I don't know what the recipe is).  We peel, seed and bake the whole half.    Now, go out there and get that er cantaloupe?    Thanks C.M.C( and thumbs up for you)!  (btw, jc is a he).|`|HHDq9ajTaa	Ok you have 2 great answers. Yes cut the top and the bottom, stand it on end, then with sharp knife and some leverage cut it straight down in half. Scoop out the seeds...(they will grow if you plant the seeds in your garden). Now here is what I do. I wrap them in Saran and microwave them just until slightly soft. (Actually I have never made soup with these, we eat them with butter, and brown Sugar sprinkled on before I nuke them soft)  If you cook them for about 8-12 minutes (test by squeezing the squash after 8 min) that should soften up the peel and meat enough to scoop out the meat without wrestling like "The Champ". TADA....It is much easier. Now Muscle Up and get er done......I have faith in you....
EMDNVrcjaa	Frequently I come across recipes that call for scraping the seeds from the vanilla bean and discarding the rest. What a waste! The entire bean is filled with flavor and, in fact, the pod has more flavor than the seeds. You can cut the bean and use a portion at a time or you can use the whole bean, depending on the depth of flavor you wish. To cut open a bean, lay it flat on a cutting surface. Holding one end of the bean to the surface, carefully slice the bean open lengthwise. When you separate the bean, thousands of tiny seeds are exposed. This step shows why it is technically a seed-pod rather than a bean. By cutting the bean open before placing it in a liquid, more of the surface of the bean is exposed, and the greater the flavoring properties. You can scrape the seeds from the pod before removing the bean if you choose.<br>  <br>  Vanilla beans can usually be used several times depending on how strenuously you've used them. For instance, if you've placed a vanilla bean in a pitcher of lemonade or a container of mulled cider or wine, the bean will still contain a lot of flavor when the beverage is gone. However, if you soak a vanilla bean in a hot cream mixture then scrape out the seeds and pith, you will probably still have some flavor left in the pod, but it won't be real strong.<br>  <br>  Rinse and dry the bean pieces after using them. If there is only the pod left, or, if you've used the bean several times for flavoring beverages let the pieces dry, and retire them to the sugar or coffee jar as they will exude a delicate flavor and fragrance for some time to come. Beans that have been used once or twice can also be ground up and used to add additional flavor to ice creams, cookies, and many other foods.|`|5W5aE3MMaa	if your going to use them one of the simplest and most flavorful ways to use them in my opinion is to use the pods in a creme brule try this one.<br>  6 large egg yolks<br>  6 tablespoons sugar<br>  1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise<br>  1 1/2 cups whipping cream<br>  <br>  6  teaspoons granulated sugar (or 8 -12 teaspoons packed brown sugar).<br>  <br>  Preheat oven to 325°F.<br>  <br>  Whisk yolks and 6 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl to blend. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean. Gradually whisk the cream into the sugar.   Divide mixture among 6 - 3/4 cup custard cups or ramekins. Arrange dishes in 13x9x2-inch baking pan. Pour enough hot water into pan to come halfway up sides of dishes.<br>  <br>  Bake custards approximately 35-40 minutes until the custard is set.  Do not overbake or your custard will be rubbery.   Remove the pan from the oven and remove custard cups from the water.  Allow custards to cool before placing in the refrigerator. Chill overnight. <br>  you dont really have to chill them overnight just let them cool completely.  believe me when I make them there are many that do not make it to the cooling stage because they are great warm too.  I would use a couple beans if your just using the husks.|`|toWa68Goaa	You could make vanilla ice cream, :)|`|vv2uk9hHaa	Put the seeds in milk... yummy vanilla milk.......  ^-^|`|Hdip83cTaa	Got a needle and thread?

You can find it at WalMart or any book store at around $10.00.  It contains everything from A-Z, desserts, soups etc..  I have the same problem and still make too much spaghetti sauce, soup, etc..

You must make use of that freezer!  They also sell great machines that make you bag, vacuum and freeze your leftovers.

They are quite reasonably priced.|`|hT7BhNamaa	Linnea M, again JC above me is quite correct, you can also use the links provided by the others. The easiest way is cut down on the ingredients, or your going to end up with more left overs than you bargained on. Instead of a cull carrot use half, shred the rest and add on a ham and salad sandwich, or to a salad. Instead of you having to dice a full onion, buy the smaller ones and only use half, the half you can use for something else, same with celery. When your at the store, buy your meat in let's say the two pack or go to the butchery section and get what you want. Just some hints.|`|53giV6PFaa	Healthy meals: Cooking for one or two    Find out how to plan healthy meals for one or two, reduce the wasted food, and add variety to your meals.    Fed up with limited healthy meal options? Tired of eating leftovers all the time? Annoyed that you must throw food away because the package contained more than you could eat?     If you usually cook for one or two people  or if members of your family rarely have time to eat together  you probably face such frustrations. But small-quantity cooking can be made easier and more interesting even for small numbers. Here's how:    Shop with convenience in mind. Purchase foods that are individually frozen, such as fruits, vegetables, chicken breasts or fish fillets. These foods allow you to thaw out only the amount you need. Also, keep on hand low-fat frozen meals and prepackaged single-serving foods, such as ready-to-eat, low-fat, reduced-sodium canned soups.    Take advantage of your freezer. Storing food in your freezer helps prevent waste and keeps foods fresher longer. Most foods freeze well, including breads, meats, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and nuts and seeds. For best quality, freeze food while it's fresh. Don't wait until it's been refrigerated or left on your counter for several days.    Cook meals in advance and freeze single-size portions. For example, make a casserole or stew and freeze individual-size servings. Then take out only the amount of food you need. Be sure to write the date and contents on packages and move older packages forward as you add food to your freezer.    Prepare one-dish meals. For quick and simple cooking, choose a dish that serves as the meal. A good choice is one that includes foods from several food groups, such as meats, whole grains, legumes and vegetables. Healthy examples include beef, barley and vegetable stew; chicken, vegetable and rice casserole; turkey and bean casserole (made with turkey breast, white beans and tomatoes); and vegetarian chili with diced vegetables.    Use extras wisely. Plan meals so that you can use the extra food in new dishes. For example, cook rice as a side dish for one meal, then use the remainder in a casserole or rice pudding. Bake chicken breasts for a meal and use the rest in sandwiches, soup or a stir-fry. Or make a meatloaf mixture and bake some as a meatloaf and freeze the uncooked portion for later use in meatballs or stuffed peppers.   Redefine a 'meal.' If you're short on time or energy, make a nutritious snack rather than a full meal. For example, spread a brown rice cake with ricotta cheese and fresh strawberries or low-sugar, spreadable fruit. Or try spreading it with herbed goat cheese and sliced olives. Other snack-turned-meals are corn muffins served with apple and cheese slices; or fat-free refried beans mixed with salsa, a small amount of low-fat sour cream and baked tortilla chips.    Invite others to eat with you. Make cooking more rewarding by inviting friends or relatives to join you for a meal. Or recruit people for a cooking club, which provides a good opportunity to try new recipes and makes preparing meals more enjoyable.    Look into cookbooks designed especially for one to two people. Not only are cookbooks a good source for recipes, they can also provide practical advice and helpful tips on such things as selecting healthy foods, planning menus, shopping and reading food labels.     If you're cooking for one or two, don't settle for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches or a bowl of cereal every night. Get creative. Try new recipes and experiment with what works for you. With a little planning and some quick cooking, you can create healthy meals for you and your dining partner.|`|vcgn6XZgaa	Jacket potato with a filling  Salmon fillet  Roasted vegetables  Pasta  Risotto

I will share my White Bread recipe from my Pillsbury Bread Machine that always turns out great...1 1/2 lb loaf  Put ingredients in the bowl/pan in the order listed do not mix them up with a spoon just leave them. Before adding the yeast make a small indent in the top of the "mountain" set the yeast in that indent close the lid and set it to make white bread...... No Exceptions. After you make 3 perfect loaves then play...I gave you Oatmeal Bread Changes below....  water 1 1/8 c  bread flour 3 c  dry milk 1 1/2 Tbl  sugar 1 1/2 Tbl  salt 1 1/4 tsp  butter 1 1/2 Tbl  (add this to the sides of pan not on the 'mountain')  Active Dry Yeast 2 tsp  or Fast Rise Yeast 1 1/2 tsp    If you are not using FRESH bought Bread Flour, or Fresh Yeast in either the 2 listed then that could be the problem in dense bread, or you are using too much liquid.   Any other kind of flour, (reg white flour doesn't have enough gluten in it and you do need to add gluten) Buy Bread Flour for your bread.    Another tip...I use this recipe and make Oatmeal Bread by reducing the flour by 1/2 c and adding Reg dry Oatmeal 1/2 cup, 11/2 tsp salt, 2 tbl butter. That is a very good bread too.  Good Luck....I know my recipe is "idiot-proof" but using fresh ingredients is the key. Give yourself time, before you mess with the recipes.....I learned the hard way, and after years of success since 1994 when I got my Bread Machine I have made hundreds of great loaves....
s5i9atFpaa	If you can be outside for this event, I would suggest:<br>  1) setting up a volleyball net and getting several giant beach balls.  it's easier for almost everyone to play no matter their skill level and people don't need much skill to hit such a large ball. <br>  2) You may like to get a colorful parachute and bounce foam and/or beach balls in that. Have people take turns running under the parachute before it comes down, switching places with the person opposite them.<br>  3)Choose a variety of subjects, such as food, songs, games, animals, etc. and write them on slips of paper and put them in a bowl. have people draw a slip and share a memory of your daughter based on the subject on the paper.<br>  4) If you can have afire in the evening, you might like to have a sing along. Be sure to include songs your daughter liked, if possible, and of course songs that remind you of her.<br>  5) Think about the kinds of games/events you think your daughter might have enjoyed and do some of those. For example, pair people up and have them sit facing each other. Then blindfold one of them, and have the blindfolded one apply makeup to the other. (just use soft applicators - no wands someone could inadvertently get poked in the eye with). Then have them reverse. Take pictures and laugh up a storm. <br>     Don't forget to make a scrapbook of the weekend with plenty of pictures and commentaries. If appropriate, you could have each guest write a note or letter to your daughter (or draw a picture for her) on the third day and read them aloud, if appropriate. Then put them in the scrap book.<br>     Have a wonderful memorial. Surely your daughter will be smiling down upon all of you, enjoying it too. Best Wishes to You.|`|TdIbrGYYaa	Wow!  I think I would focus those thoughts more around what she would have liked to do should she be able to.  This way it would be more like she is there with you while you all remember her.

What about doing stations where people could earn tickets towards small prizes should they be able to guess these exact things?  <br>  <br>  Its kinda hard to answer because I don't know how old your daughter was so lets say she was an infant/toddler and not able to tell you these things.  How about having those present plant a tree in her memory and each person can write out their wish for her while in Heaven and you could tie the wishes to the tree with pretty ribbon.  From there, just do the things you would have liked to do with her.  Maybe pony rides or Miniature golf.  <br>  <br>  Email me and I will try and give you more suggestions but it's real hard not knowing how old she was when she passed.  God Bless You!

829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	The bottles are supposed to be super sterilized.  That's been done for years and years.  I would think that Coca~ Cola would be especially careful to make sure all safety procedures are followed by any company packing their products.  I drink Mexican coke and it's fine.  So, knowing the companies policies, I would say that it's untrue.
Eb3SnljMaa	how about asking your sisters mother in law super easy. this way you get the recipe you liked. or even ask your sister she may know. even easier.
vcgn6XZgaa	Each person will have their own concoction, or if you prefer, recipe. All depends on their own special likes and dislikes. Basically after the natural sticks and parts are all stuffed into a bottle the liquid can be added. Usually, for the first batch, the bottle is filled with red wine (cheap wine is just fine for this step. Most Dominicans I know use the wine called "La Fuerza") and a little honey (about a 1/4 cup). This is left to sit for about a week, mainly to clean all the ingredients, wash away the bitterness of the sticks and to get the bottle ready for the good stuff. After the week has passed empty out the wine, "they say" you're not supposed to drink this, but it won't hurt if you like the taste. Many places throughout the Dominican Republic have the bottles already cured for you so you may not need this step. If your bottle is wet inside then it has been pre-cured.    Now for the good part. Add some good Dominican Ron/ Rum -  you can use other brands if you don't have the Dominican kind. Some people use dark rum while others use light rum (I prefer the light, if you care. Because when I add the honey it is just a little too sweet for my tastes using the dark rum). Some add half rum and half wine. Some just a little wine and more rum. Many people add honey and vanilla (buy some Dominican style vanilla for the real flavor). Try it with a little gin or vodka for good measure. It is all a matter of taste and what ingredients are on hand. Whatever the ingredients that are chosen, they need to steep in the bottle. Let the bottle alone for at least a week, the longer the liquid sits in the bottle the more wood flavor it will have.  A long or short time all depends on your taste. I suggest having 2 or 3 bottles going. This way you can have one ready for drinking with another is brewing. You do not want to take a chance and run out when you are needing a trago (drink). Each bottle can be made in a little different style. Experiment with it until you get the blend that most satisfies all those inner urges.|`|Am1wfhBDaa	You may be getting a knock on your door by now and it will be the Feds. I'd call a Lawyer if I were you.|`|DXtpSeb2aa	just came back from Dominican Republic and bought to bottles of "mamajuana" while I was there. Some of them are made with leaves and sticks of different plants (canelilla leaves, guayacan,etc...), others are make with shellfish, Carey turtle and others.    Is also important that you cure all the ingredients before, to get a better taste.    This is the recipe to cure the mamajuana:    Fill up 3/4 of the mamajuana with vino tinto (red wine)    and remainig 1/4 with honey (miel de abejas)for three days     after that throw away all the liquids,    now add up to 3/4 White Rum (I used Brugal blanco)    and the remaining 1/4 honey (miel de abejas)    also if you like add some vanilla beans or the rum of your choice. Bacardi, Brugal Barcelo, Bermudez or what you have available...    I'm not a drinker, but my husband likes this drink. It's good for the digestion and also has atributes of some medicinal and afrodisiac powers to it.    This is all I can help you with.    Enjoy it!
hT7BhNamaa	Cia, the recipe according to the other ingredients is quite correct, your preparing garlic fries, same as garlic bread, the garlic is the dominating factor here. Another example are Spicy Buffalo Wings, all your really tasting there is all that spice and heat, not the wings themselves. In your case, the potatoes are only being coated and not marinated so in the cooking process, the garlic wouldn't be so overpowerring.    Chris|`|53giV6PFaa	I found recipes that ask for 3 cloves of garlic for 3 potatoes.  Since you are using 6, then 6 cloves.  That is about 6-8 tsps of minced garlic which is a lot less than 1/2 cup.  There are 24 tsp in a 1/2 cup.  So I would use 6 cloves of garlic for this recipe and 1 1/2 tsp of thyme.    EDIT:  I would keep the same amount of oil, because potatoes soak up alot of liquids and you are using 6 of them.|`|vcgn6XZgaa	A couple of cloves of garlic should be more than enough!|`|GWQ0uZyeaa	Sounds right to me.|`|Drj1VOpXaa	If you are sprinkling the mixture over the french fries, then you need that much.

LOL|`|AA11765580	You can easily adjust garlic to suit your taste.  The amount for this recipe sounds right though.  Yes, if you reduce the garlic, you won't need as much oil to saute it in.|`|KWhKwgsSaa	Those would certainly be some spicy fries.  Even the thyme amount seems excessive.

Some "vegans" also refuse to eat yeast products.|`|6CjDTJskaa	Because some times bees are injured when the beekeepers go to get the honey, besides the honey is made from animal product and vegans dont eat anything that is from animals, in my opinion you would be considered a vegetarian because you still eat animal product. but you can really think what ever you want.|`|spS2lnDXaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AshK3o1NhpGY6RM8IEdAK7fty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090122171542AA6Ix9p&show=7#profile-info-c9cdd9cb269543ad2011d87f87d4c10daa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  Please.|`|we2Csi51aa	yeaaa sorta im a vegetarian and i eat honey...vegans dont eat anything from an animal or anything they make like honey, milk etc. but vegetarians just dont eat meat.|`|64554a8e1157e502654f643d0ffe309baa	No, I don't eat honey.|`|uhchod38aa	Honey is an animal product.

Similarly Vegan really means someone who only eats plants so again technically you can't be vegan and eat honey. In the real world though someone who eats only plant based foods and honey is still vegan. ( also goes for a vegan who wears silk, drinks beer filtered through nonvegan substances or wears shoes with animal glue)<br>  <br>  btw The ethical implications of honey stem from the fact that production often involves artificially manipulating the hive by prematurely killing the queen and workers, use of smoke and artificial insemination etc all to produce a luxury product we can live without. Personally if the honey is ethically sourced I'd eat it but I would never touch the industrialised stuff you get in supermarkets.<br>  <br>  Also a lot of vegans think eating bee spit is gross.|`|sWXrnErnaa	There are various stages of Vegan/vegatarianism....<br>  <br>  No your not a vegan if you eat honey but you would be vegetarian...<br>  <br>   Vegan: excludes animal flesh (meat, poultry, fish and seafood), animal products (eggs and dairy), and usually excludes honey and the wearing and use of animal products (leather, silk, wool, lanolin, gelatin...).<br>  <br>  The major vegan societies all disallow honey, but some "vegans" still use it. Some "vegans" also refuse to eat yeast products.<br>  <br>  Dietary Vegan: follows a vegan diet, but doesn't necessarily try and exclude non-food uses of animals.<br>  <br>  Plant-Based Diet - increasingly being used to mean a diet exclusively of plant material, therefore the same as 'Dietary Vegan'. <br>  <br>  Vegetarian: For the purpose of membership of IVU, vegetarianism includes veganism and is defined as the practice of not eating meat, poultry or fish or their by-products, with or without the use of dairy products or eggs.<br>  <br>  Often broken down further into OVO-LACTO, and LACTO. Vegetarians may or may not try and minimize their non food use of animals like vegans.<br>  <br>  Ovo-Lacto Vegetarian: same as VEGAN (see right), but also eats eggs and milk products. This is the most common form of Vegetarianism in many Western countries.<br>  <br>  Lacto Vegetarian: Same as VEGAN, but also consumes milk and milk products. Common in India.<br>  <br>  Veggie -- Shortened nick-name for a VEGETARIAN; often includes VEGANs.<br>  <br>  Halal Vegetarian - proposed by our friends in the West Asia region as "a person or product complying with the generally accepted definitions of both Halal and Vegetarian." <br>  <br>  Strict vegetarian (or Pure Vegetarian): originally appears to have meant 'vegan' (before that word was invented), now can now mean vegan or vegetarian, or almost anything.<br>  <br>  Semi-Vegetarian: Eats less meat than average person. See also PSEUDO-VEGETARIAN.<br>  <br>  Pseudo-Vegetarian: Claims to be vegetarian, but isn't. Often used by VEGETARIANS to describe SEMI-VEGETARIANs, and PESCETARIANs.<br>  <br>  Pescetarian: Similar to VEGETARIAN, but also consumes fish. (often is a person avoiding factory-farming techniques...) See also PSEUDO-VEGETARIAN.<br>  <br>  Fruitarian: Same as VEGAN, but only eats foods that don't kill the plant (apples can be picked without killing the plant, carrots cannot).<br>  <br>  Vegetable Consumer: Means anyone who consumes vegetables. Not necessarily a VEGETARIAN.<br>  <br>  Herbivore: Mainly eats grass or plants. Not necessarily a VEGETARIAN.<br>  <br>  Plant-Eater: Mainly eats plants. Not necessarily a VEGETARIAN.<br>  <br>  Nonmeat-Eater: Does not eat meat. Most definitions do not consider fish, fowl or seafood to be meat. Animal fats and oils, bonemeal and skin are not considered meat.<br>  <br>  Kosher: Made according to a complex set of Jewish dietary laws. Does not imply VEGAN in any case. Does not imply OVO-LACTO VEGETARIAN in any case. Even KOSHER products containing milk products may contain some types of animals which are not considered 'meat'.<br>  <br>  Pareve/Parve: One category in KOSHER dietary laws. Made without meat or milk products or their derivatives. Eggs and true fish are pareve, shellfish are not.<br>  <br>  Nondairy: Does not have enough percentage of milkfat to be called dairy. May actually contain milk or milk derivatives.<br>  <br>  Nonmeat: Made without meat. May include eggs, milk, cheese. Sometimes even included animal fats, seafood, fish, fowl. <br>  <br>  Then of course just to really confuse the issue there are Fruitarians...The strict fruitarian diet consists of RAW fruit and seeds ONLY!<br>  <br>  Some fruitarians believe fruitarianism was the original diet of mankind in the form of Adam and Eve based on Genesis 1:29.[9] They believe that a return to an Eden-like paradise will require simple living and a holistic approach to health and diet.[12] Some fruitarians wish to avoid killing in all its forms, including plants.[9]<br>  <br>  Some fruitarians say that eating some types of fruit does the parent plant a favor and that fleshy fruit has evolved to be eaten by animals, to achieve seed dispersal.[8]<br>  <br>  Some fruitarians will eat only what falls (or would fall) naturally from a plant, that is: foods that can be harvested without killing the plant. These foods consist primarily of culinary fruits, nuts, and seeds.[5] Some do not eat grains, believing it is unnatural to do so,[6] and some fruitarians feel that it is improper for humans to eat seeds.[7] Others believe they should eat only plants that spread seeds when the plant is eaten.[8] Others eat seeds and some cooked foods.[9]<br>  <br>  Some fruitarians use the botanical definitions of fruits and consume pulses, such as many beans and peas,[10] while others include green leafy vegetables[11] and/or root vegetables in their diet.|`|c1Ob2S9raa	um well i think so because they don't eat anything from or anything to do with an animal, so i think you are still a vegan, just as you say not a strict one.<br>  <br>  = D|`|PNakIe8Paa	vegans believe they shouldn't eat products produced by animals. just like milk is produced by a cow, honey is produced by bee's, so therefore they belive they shouldnt eat it.|`|Dvfb4DZKaa	because they believe that it's a type of abuse to make honey. thay also don't, sometimes, wear leather and animal made fabrics.|`|ngpo0iK3aa	I am a vegan and i don't eat honey<br>  nope they don't usely eat honey|`|c24c92b6e2571d7ff8699136760929c3aa	It's an animal product.|`|zvzjZwFnaa	animal product. like milk|`|rrWhhiMEaa	Its made by bees, for bees.|`|01ojyYzOaa	because it was made by an animal, <br>  xo|`|hLnMalksaa	cuz it still comes from the bees|`|wXCX0Gy7aa	because it comes from a bee i guess

Combine the yeast, sugar, and the warm water in a large bowl until the yeast is dissolved and foamy, about 5 to 10 minutes.<br>     2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the cornmeal and salt with the boiling water. Beat vigorously with a wooden spoon to blend. Add the melted butter and mix to incorporate. Now, pour the yeast mixture into the cornmeal mixture, stirring to combine. Gradually add the flour, mixing well after each addition. Add a couple of tablespoons of water if the dough feels dry and doesn't come together easily. Continue to mix until a dough forms into a ball. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead, adding just enough flour to keep the dough from sticking, until smooth and elastic, about 5 to 10 minutes.<br>     3. Grease a large bowl with oil and transfer the dough to the bowl, brush the top with more oil so it is completely coated. Cover the dough with a kitchen towel and let it rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 11/2 hours.<br>     4. Turn the dough out onto the floured surface and knead briefly, 3 or 4 times, to punch out the air. Gather the dough into a ball and shape it into a round loaf. Cover the dough with a kitchen towel and let rise again until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.<br>     5. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. and place a pizza stone in the oven to heat up.<br>     6. Put the dough round on the pizza stone and brush the top with oil. Sprinkle the top of the bread with coarse salt. Bake in middle of the oven for 40 to 50 minutes until the bread is golden brown and bottom sounds hollow when tapped. *To recreate the steam effect from authentic Portuguese brick ovens, spray the bread and oven walls with cold water every 10 minutes. Transfer the bread to a wire rack to cool.|`|UETAqR8Taa	Hi, its a long recipe (well more the time with the dough). the best Broa cornbread on the net is at  <br>  <br>  recipezaar.com.<br>  <br>  yum enjoy.

5W5aE3MMaa	it depends on if you like baked cheesecake or not.  chances are the ones with sweet and condensed milk and lemon juice are no bake.  I like to use them when I just need a cheesecake fix.  if your looking for a nice new your style cheesecake that is creamy and dense then try this.

And well, I tend to like sweetened (and condensed, although it's different.. see what your recipe calls for... add no sugar if it's sweetened) because it gives a nice creamy texture. I find that adding granulated sugar gives it.. well.. a granulated feel. The sugar in condensed milk is lactose (just regular milk sugar, has a different taste than glucose)... sweetened milk has added glucose (regular sugar).

EMDNVrcjaa	Minerals.|`|48OX56Czaa	No minerals or impurities of any kind.|`|AA11786341	Distillation involves boiling the water and then condensing the steam into a clean container, leaving most solid contaminants behind. Distillation produces very pure water but also leaves behind a leftover white or yellowish mineral scale on the distillation apparatus, which requires that the apparatus be frequently cleaned. Distillation does not guarantee the absence of bacteria in drinking water; unless the reservoir and/or bottle are sterilized before being filled, and once the bottle has been opened, there is a risk of presence of bacteria

Top with parmesan if you like.<br>  <br>  Bean burritos - heat refried beans or pinto beans (or whatever kind you like) on the stove or in the microwave, heat up the tortillas, put beans in tortilla and add whatever toppings you want (I like corn).<br>  <br>  Fried rice - spray a skillet/wok with pam, dump in some leftover rice, fry for a minute or two, add peas & carrots (frozen food section 99 cents-$1), fry for a minute, move the mixture to the edge of the skillet (creating a empty hole in the middle) and crack in an egg....scrammble, use your spatula to chop it up really finely.  Mix everything together, put in as much soy sauce as you want.<br>  <br>  Stir Fry - Bag of frozen mixed veggies, (or any fresh you may have), fry them up on a pammed skillet, add soy or teriyaki sauce, serve over heated up leftover rice.

You get the taste of a hamburger without it being too filling.|`|Hx2a3xGoaa	because they're different and it makes people feel better about themselves because they're like, "oh, hamburgers are bad for me, but if i eat a little one it will be okay and then i won't have to go running to burn it off because it was little."<br>  <br>  we're a very weight conscious society.|`|lctPX96Haa	I think they just like to rip-off people!

jMUOfAU6aa	just eat it, be poliet, whats one more day, uve eaten meat this long right, not like ur saveing any animals lives, this one is already dead|`|khXGGBiTaa	I frankly don't see the problem. If your mother knows (does she know?) that you're a vegetarian, then the ribs were not intended for you anyway - they're intended for your friend and her family and your family. If you haven't told her that you're a vegetarian, then the ribs were intended for everyone who's there. She probably bought them days ago, in anticipation of cooking for the visitors.<br>  <br>  It's hardly disrespecting the cook, if you don't eat an item of food that has been prepared, but which for some reason you either cannot or will not eat. As long as she knows the reason, she'll most likely be ok with it. Depends on her, I guess. Some parents are ok with their children becoming vegetarian. Some get used to the idea eventually. Some never do. Some see it as an insult to them, or as tantamount to blasphemy. I was lucky in that my mother had been a vegetarian for most of her life, before I made my decision, so I had a very smooth transition.<br>  <br>  Don't eat the ribs. Just eat the salad and potatoes. Be glad she prepared those and that the vegetarian in the family has something to eat. Enjoy!|`|KOj8XOHPaa	You have to start somewhere.  Be prepared to come across this situation more than once in your vegetarian life.  Simply just pass on the ribs, and let your mom know why.  She might make a snide remark, but just bear with it.  My mom intentionally made a pot roast when I told her I was becoming vegetarian, and tried to make a big deal about it at the dinner table when I opted out.  I just ignored it, was the better person for not arguing, and the remarks eventually went away.  <br>  <br>  But do tell her that you love the salad and baked potato!|`|GXWcZ0ACaa	So, you've just turned vegetarian? And, you're still debating whether you should eat meat or not? <br>  <br>  That doesn't make much sense. You don't seem like a real vegetarian. It sounds like you're in the process of becoming a vegetarian still.<br>  <br>  If you were a real vegetarian, you wouldn't eat meat. Your mom would know that you're a vegetarian as well..so she wouldn't have cooked ribs...<br>  <br>  I'm a little confused, but okay.|`|ngpo0iK3aa	I am a vegetarian to and i dont eat any meat just say to your mum i want to be a vegetarian for any resion you want and can i just have a plate of some of the big salad and baked potatoes they are so YUMMY|`|FEAV8uUkaa	im a vegan.  if i have dinner at my parents house my mom will make me a baked potato and salad like your mom.  your parents are probably happy youre a vegetarian.  so, dont eat the meat.  bye|`|80u6a2Joaa	no :ooo!<br>  dont eat it.<br>  dont break down. <br>  you're mother shouldn't be disrespected, she should support your decisiion, she prolly wont be disrespected. (:<br>  wish you the best of luck|`|yYBMYMwZaa	If you're a vegetarian wont your mom understand that you cant eat the ribs?|`|LbZk7uKqaa	I would recommend you not eat them.  She should understand why you choose not to eat them.  Good luck!|`|rkeLJ8RAaa	dont eat them!!!|`|2RzEaod9aa	If you're going to justify eating meat every time someone cooks it, you're going to be an omnivore. Just an FYI.|`|4k5MkmInaa	No!<br>  <br>  im sure your mom's an understanding person (all mothers are)she just wants whats best for you so she should understand your reason for not eating ribs.<br>  <br>  dont give up being a vegeterian! :)|`|xETCO0rUaa	You're not disrespecting her if you're supporting your beliefs. Just eat the salad and potatoes. You could always ask your mom if she could make you something else like tofu or something. Since you only just started you can be a little flexable and if you have no choice have a few bites. Congrats on being a vegetarian, i'm happy for you and the hundreds of animals that won't suffer because of you:):)|`|6CjDTJskaa	well if you are going to become a vegetarian it is best to not give in and dont eat the meat. i'd just eat the salad and the potatoes and stay clear of the ribs, just explain that you are becoming a vegetarian.|`|spS2lnDXaa	It's not really going to be very convincing that you are devoted to this is you give in and defy it on, well, the first day...<br>  <br>  Don't eat them! She should respect your choice anyways.|`|An6FwFoMaa	No. If you are becoming a vegetarian, then don't eat the ribs.|`|c27920620869d3d5b40c4f7c78b6b42aaa	Take the salad, and the baked potato and tell her how great everything looks and smells. <br>  <br>  If she asks if you are going to try a rib, tell her no thank. Then again let her know how much you like your potato or how pretty the salad looks. <br>  <br>  If you haven't talked to your mom about being a vegetarian though, it's a really good idea that you do so. I turned vegetarian in my parents home too, and my mom was pretty supportive (my dad not so much) with out her support I don't think I could have done it.|`|e319dd7fc367cb467844fd4db759150caa	DON'T!!!!<br>  <br>  Something had to die for her to make those. Eat the salad. Your mom should respect your decision not to eat any meat and refrain from anything that hurts animals. By the way, if you haven't told her you are a vegetarian yet, you need to. You can't do it in secret; be proud.<br>  <br>  If you are a newbie to the life style, you may want to do a little research too. It helps, so you know what foods to eat and which to avoid. Get good recipes too|`|rOZ1WSqNaa	Well---if ur gonna be a veggie (like me) ur gonna have to get used to not eating meat. (That includes disrespecting ur mother!) Well, ur mother should understand ur a veggie. U told her right? If ur gonna et ribs just to be polite (on ur first day!) maybe this veggie thing isn't working out. U know, u could just eat the salad and baked potatoes!|`|xePaFCv9aa	dont eat them duh......<br>  just have a salad and baked potatoes<br>  you should be careful when you are a vegetarian you need to make sure you are getting what your body needs still<br>  but yeah.. she shouldnt mind if you dont eat the ribs<br>  good luck  :)|`|AA11786341	if you weren't vegan and you don't like ribs would you eat them?<br>  NO!<br>  So what's the problem,<br>  Your Mom knows what you don't like,doesn't she?|`|eWzhFtIzaa	don't eat ribs!!!!, that use to be a helpless extremely cute cow!<br>  my favorite animal by the way, do the cow a favor, and don't eat him.<br>  =]|`|5UxQVmekaa	That's breaking!

wPM6eBkWaa	Cheese on toast is wonderful.  My favorite cheese is pepper jack, spicy but not to spicy.  Cheese that melts good is Fontina, Gruyere and Gouda.   I use those for mac and cheese and they are wonderful with grilled cheese sandwich with sliced apples and smoked bacon.  Other wonderful cheese include provolone, Irish cheddar, goat and feta cheese.|`|sDKCX43caa	I like to use tasty cheese with thin rings of onion underneath. The cheese melts fast enough that the onion just warms, and still has a bite to it.|`|mjshqfuyaa	I love cheese on toast i think the best kind to melt if kraft or string cheese :]]]]|`|1b40b411fde105efac034d33b5f3fdeeaa	I love cheese on toast, but its got to be Cheddar wth a bit of pickle on top too!|`|w5uHiNcoaa	I love cheese on toast. I like it with a decent cheddar or double gloucester. One favourite of mine, though, is some cheddar and mexicana (or just plain mexicana if I feel flush!). Delicious!<br>  <br>  Another thing that is great on cheese on toast is apple - slice some apples (I like red apples the best) and put on the bread then cover in cheese. Toast as normal - yummy.|`|0e7e2273a98e965ef6963c7287e9faffaa	I love cheese on toast, I like to put a small scraping of tomato puree on with some onion and sweetcorn and then put the cheese on top (Cheddar is the best) with some herbs and make pizza toast. Much more interesting than plain cheese!|`|BaNrweQ4aa	cheese on toast is really nice :) i like red leicester cheese, or cheddar cheese. they both taste really nice; and melt really well. doesn't all cheese? lol|`|2r4kfcJmaa	Yes, mozzarella cheese on toast is good with tomato soup. I had it last night for dinner.|`|PPyMhRJAaa	I love cheese on toast with some mustard and Worcestershire sauce - yummy!|`|Zog10QRsaa	If you mean like grilled cheese, then ya, I love cheese on toast :) My favorite is Provolone cheese, yum! :)|`|kf7XLE8kaa	Yes, I love cheese on toast.

I also like cheddar cheese melted on a Triscuit with a sliced olive on top.|`|8nmEXGctaa	Try mixing mature cheddar with mozzarella it is wonderful.|`|zfwGZ2Pxaa	yeah i do the best cheese is red Leicester|`|RRHgektSaa	i love cheese on toast , and melted cheese always seems to taste nicer than normal un melted cheese (Y)|`|N53iI8weaa	Yes - and it's got to be real English Mature Cheddar thank you !|`|FR4fzr4Zaa	yer its ok -x|`|ZGvpWQ1Aaa	yea i do actuslly. that was my fav when i was wee. chedder!!|`|0vQsoYIbaa	That's what I call cheaters grilled cheese.  Make the toast, butter lightly, then microwave a piece of cheese between the slices.|`|073e495ca8ebf7b9f0ad3b9627adb8b9aa	I love it. I find montery jack melts well. I add lots of hot peppers. Also, you could try, havarti on top, and then put sour cream mixed with fresh dill on top of that. Feta with browned buttered french stick, topped with olive oil. It's all good.
syC3uQpjaa	Figure out how many calories worth of sweets you will alow yourself a day. Around 200 or 300 calories on a regular day is reasonable. <br>  When eating sweets, use portion control. You can now buy Christies Thinsations cookies and snacks in 100 calorie packs. Not only are they all your favourite treats (Oreos, Chips Ahoy, graham crackers, bits and bites...) but they are packaged with one serving in each bag. Also, Cadbury Thins as well as KitKat and Aero Singles are chocolate bars that have very few calories. <br>  Buy sugar free sweets. Many health food stores sell these in bulk. I do not recommend eating large amounts of these (they contain aspartame and artificial sweeteners which may cause cancer) but they do help satisfy small cravings. <br>  Burn the extra calories. If you eat 200 calories worth of sweets or other empty calories,then you will need to burn the extra calories that you consumed. In order to loose weight, you will need to burn more calories then the sum of the calories of everything that you ate, each day.|`|wRJPiIU7aa	496 with whip according to <a href="http://calorielab.com/restaurants/starbucks-uk/3023" rel="nofollow">http://calorielab.com/restaurants/starbu...</a> but im not sure how accurate that is|`|mMxmBcDpaa	On the starbucks web site they have a break down for all there drinks, I dont understand why it would be different outside the US but Ok....

eV6MHADQaa	my dad catered and ran a hospital kitchen never turn up the temp increase the time and yes they can go in at the same time as long as your oven is big enough|`|ZA5QTj3Zaa	You should not have to adjust the temperature.  Make sure there is adequate space between the pans to allow for air flow.  If not, you may have to increase the time.

Topped it off with fire roasted diced tomatoes. It turned our DELISH :)|`|MhfneF0xaa	Mix in some cheese. I like Parmesan, but you can use other cheeses as well. Sprinkle some cheese on top during the last few minutes of cooking. You could also mix in some finely chopped carrots. Or mushrooms. Instead of serving with ketchup (yawn) try serving with gravy, or a mixture of 3/4 tomato sauce and 1/4 barbecue sauce (straight barbecue sauce overwhelms the flavor of the meat loaf)<br>  <br>  If you use half ground beef and half bulk Italian sausage, you could stud the loaf with sliced black olives, and serve with spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce or ketchup. Alfredo sauce could also work here.|`|APNB4OfIaa	Don't use all beef, mix in some ground pork, or pork sausage. 20%-30%  <br>  Use Panko bread crumbs rather than crackers or white bread.  <br>  Use a potato peeler to shred a carrot & add to the mix,  makes the loaf sweeter & moister.  <br>  On the flip side add a little drained saurkraut or horseradish.  <br>  Mix in a little of your favorite BBQ sauce  <br>  I've used all these at one time or another with good success.  Note do not mix the BBQ & saurkraut in the same loaf.  That gets really ugly.|`|AA11295695	I use 85/15 (15% fat) ground beef with usually a premade low-sodium meatloaf mix.<br>  One thing that makes meatloaf amazing is put about a cup of shredded cheese on top of the meatloaf before you put it in the oven.  Add 5-10 minutes to the cooking time.<br>  The cheese can be cheddar, mix of cheeses etc.<br>  In the oven, the cheese becomes gooey on the inside and crispy on the outside.

95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	I have to say that's nearly impossible without know what you're measuring; weight to volume conversions are totally dependent on the substance being measured. I can try to help with some comparisons...<br>  <br>  1 c chocolate chips = 152 g<br>  <br>  1 c cocoa powder = 128 g<br>  <br>  1 c walnuts, chopped = 122 g<br>  <br>  1 c walnut/pecan halves = 99 g<br>  <br>  1 c shredded coconut = 71 g<br>  <br>  1 c solid shortening, e.g. Crisco? = 205 g<br>  <br>  1Tbsp baking powder = 12 g<br>  <br>  1 Tbsp salt = 18 g<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  For egg salad I would say that 99g is about 3/4 cup. <br>  <br>  Of course it's impossible to know without a kitchen scale, which are relatively inexpensive. If you're going to start measuring your food by weight, it would probably be a good idea to invest in once since weight-to-volume conversions are difficult.
xUfRRGM8aa	Well the truth is parties are always filled with people you don't know. That is the fun of a party, different people mingling and getting to know each other. If you never want to go to parties with people you don't know you are going to be sad and lonely. <br>  <br>  However that is not your question so....if you saw her today it is too obvious to play sick. Other possibilities: You ticked off mom and she won't let you go (say she found beer in your room or something) you have to stay with a younger sibling because your grandma had to go to the emergency room and your parents are going there to be with her (she could have passed out from dizziness) Or text when it is time to be there that you got a flat and are waiting to get it changed......then eventually when she is having fun with everyone (so she won't be as peeved) text that the whole thing was so frustrating and you are tired and grimy feeling and just going to go to bed.|`|QfYGhtVwaa	Unwell, car broken down, have to babysit, simply don't turn up (sorry I felt weird, went for a lie down and then woke up at 12.30am!).|`|7sA8HwTzaa	There are a lot of important factors not mentioned here.  Like how old are you and what kind of party is this?  How close are you to the girl having the party?  Do you always have problems with parties?<br>  <br>  I think that if at all possible, you should force yourself to go to the party for at least half an hour and then, and only then, if you still feel weird because of the other people, you can tell her that you don't feel well and go home.  You should never miss the opportunity to meet the person who could be the love of your life of someone who could help you get a fabulous job or could save your life.  <br>  <br>  Don't look at this as a challenge, but as an opportunity.

bO9p8Kxdaa	Eggs <br>  <br>  Eggs are a leavening agent and the yolks add fat for a tender and light texture. The yolks also act as an emulsifier for a smooth and even texture in the finished product. And the proteins contribute to the structure of the baked good.|`|de72fa747bd877831a656fc97e91fc1baa	eggs act like a cement.  they are what holds things together so you dont end up with a crumbly loaf of bread|`|BhFeii5Xaa	Eggs in bread recipes help to keep the finished product from being quite as crumbly as those without eggs.<br>  <br>  Bake 2 loaves from the same recipe. One with eggs and one without them. Let cool and slice and see the difference.<br>  <br>  It isn't that it adds more protein or some other stupid answer like that. It does, but that wasn't why the eggs were added in the first place when the recipe was developed.|`|tbzVUKcyaa	it adds protein but more importantly is a raising agent. some need it to rise because of the amount of flour and yeast etc. no point adding it unless it says to unless you use it as a glaze, this is a nice tecture and colour to the bread.|`|64cf4def66c3758d77a8429798de064caa	I think it makes it more glutinous , and gives it a stronger stretching power. like a Pizza mixture.

EMDNVrcjaa	Per 1/4 cup of beans:<br>  <br>  Protein 3-3-1/2 grams<br>  Carbs 12.5 grams<br>  calories 50-60 <br>  sugar >0.125<br>  <br>  Nutritional Facts<br>  Protein<br>        Each half-cup serving of dry beans provides six to seven grams of protein, meets at least 10% of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein, yet costs about 20 cents per serving. <br>   <br>        A single half-cup serving of cooked dry beans counts as one, one-ounce serving of lean meat in the USDA Food Pyramid Meat and Beans group, and as a full serving of vegetables in the Vegetables group. <br>  <br>        The quality and digestibility of beans can be improved by consuming them with cereal grains. Beans are a rich source in lysine, but a poor source of methionine. Cereal grains are a poor source of lysine, but high in methionine and other sulfur amino acids. When beans and grains are served together in dishes like beans and rice, or tortillas and refried beans, they provide a complimentary protein profile. <br>  <br>  Kcalories<br>        There are only 100 to 120 kcalories in a half-cup serving of beans. However, Kcalories and other nutrients are diluted in canned beans because the moisture content is higher. <br>  <br>  Carbohydrates<br>        Beans contain an average of 25 grams of carbohydrates per serving. The carbohydrates in cooked beans are mainly starch, a complex carbohydrate, and less than 1% of simple sugars, mostly Sucrose. <br>  <br>        Discarding the soaking and cooking water helps remove oligosaccharides and reduces flatulence. Hot soaking removes about 50% of these sugars. Extended soaking removes more, but reduces vitamins and minerals. Canned beans may contain up to 4% sucrose as a flavor enhancer. <br>  <br>  Fiber<br>        A half-cup serving of cooked dry beans provides about 25-30% of the Daily Value of dietary fiber. About 75% of the fiber is insoluble which may reduce the risk of colon cancer. The remaining 25% of the fiber is soluble fiber which may reduce blood cholesterol. Studies have confirmed that beans are effective hypochoesterolemic agents when added to the diet. <br>  <br>        Consumption of beans produces a moderate increase in blood glucose and insulin levels which may be helpful in the metabolic control of diabetes. The American Diabetes Association and the American Dietetic Association include beans in the exchange system. <br>  <br>        The slower release of glucose and the increased satiety from beans may also to enhance the effectiveness of weight-reducing diets. <br>  <br>  Lipids<br>       A half-cup serving of beans contains less than 0.5 grams of mostly polyunsaturated fat and no cholesterol. Pinto bean lipid is 84% polyunsaturated fatty acids. Most of this fatty acid is linoleic acid.<br>  <br>  Vitamins & Folacin<br>       Although some B vitamins are lost in preparation, cooked dry beans retain more than 70% of these vitamins after hot soaking and cooking. Extended cooking times will result in greater B vitamin losses. <br>       One half-cup serving of beans provides 36% of the Recommended Daily Intake (RDI) of 400 micrograms of folacin and 11% of the RDI for thiamin.<br>  <br>  Minerals<br>       One half-cup serving of cooked dry beans contains large amounts of iron, phosphorous, magnesium, manganese, potassium, copper, calcium, and zinc. <br>      * The iron and calcium content can increase slightly when hard water is used for home preparation. Canned beans sometimes contain added calcium to increase firmness. <br>      * The bioavailability of these minerals is somewhat lower due to the presence of fiber, phenolic compounds and phytic acid, which decreases their absorption. The absorption of the nonheme form of iron in beans can be increased by consuming beans with a source of vitamin C, or with small amounts of meat. <br>      * One half-cup serving of cooked, unsalted dry beans contains 500 mg of potassium and small amounts of sodium. The level of potassium may be useful in a hypertensive diet. <br>      * One half-cup serving of salted beans provides nearly 20% of the Daily Value for sodium on a 2,000-calorie diet. Most commercially prepared canned and dried beans contain added sodium for flavor. Check the label to determine sodium content.|`|ILpp3ncYaa	Nothing gets bigger, the beans just expand.

My sister-in-law worked for a contractor for school lunches one time, she helped serve the food. Very often there would be mold on the food, and her boss told her to serve it anyway, that the kids wouldn't notice. When he wasn't around she would throw it in the trash. My daughter had a meal ticket in high school, and her school system started using contractors for lunches. She came home and told me that the kids were seeing some prepacked items they were selling that had mold in them, and that the contractor was buying some of the stuff from a thrift bakery. I told her no more lunches at school, and she brought her lunch from then on.  If the school is making good lunches from scratch and not using contractors, it might be better to eat in the cafeteria.  I was overweight as a teenager, and decided one time to take my lunch money and buy outside the school. I couldn't buy as much and would buy a couple of bananas and once a week eat a hamburger and fries or a drink.  I lost 10 pounds in about 2 months just from that one change.|`|l7GjBVvhaa	To eat school lunch food. Believe it or not most school lunches are healthy for you.

The meat will continue to marinate when you freeze it and it will be so delicious when you do decide to cook it.  You can store it the same amount of time as regular steak, just make sure the bag doesn't leak in the freezer.|`|MbW8KRoGaa	The best way would be to pat the remaining marinade off of the steak and wrap it in plastic wrap--then wrap it in two layers (or one of heavy duty) of aluminum foil...then put it in a freezer bag. <br>  The steak can keep for 4-6 months if it's sealed up properly.
zawmsUO1aa	My freezer is my friend!<br>  <br>  These Don't Freeze Well:<br>  <br>  Greasy foods (They just become greasier.)<br>  Cake icings made with egg whites<br>  Cream fillings and soft frostings<br>  Pies made with custard or cream fillings<br>  Fried foods (They tend to lose their crispness.)<br>  Fruit jelly on sandwiches may soak into the bread.<br>  Soft cheese, such as cream cheese (can become watery)<br>  Mayonnaise (It separates; use salad dressing instead.)<br>  Sour cream (It becomes thin and watery)<br>  Potatoes cooked in soups and stews (They become mushy and may darken. If using potatoes, cook until barely soft and still firm; then freeze quickly.)<br>  <br>  <br>  These Change During Freezing:<br>  <br>  Gravies and other fat-based sauces may separate and need to be recombined by stirring or processing in the blender.<br>  Thickened sauces may need thinning after freezing; thin with broth or milk.<br>  Seasonings such as onions, herbs and flavorings used in recipes can change during freezing. These are best added during reheating to obtain accurate flavors.<br>  Vegetables, pastas and grains used in cooked recipes usually are softer after freezing and reheating. (undercook before freezing, or add when dish is reheated)<br>  Heavy cream can be frozen if used for cooking, but it will not whip after freezing.<br>  Some yogurts may suffer texture changes.<br>  Raw vegetables lose their crispness, but can be used for cooking, stews, etc.<br>  Many cheeses change texture in the freezer. Most hard cheeses turn crumbly (which makes them okay for grating, but not for slicing)<br>  <br>  I've heard that you can freeze meat in a marinade but I've never tried it. It seems like it would be good cooked in a crockpot once it thawed out.<br>  <br>  Be sure to label and date everything because it all looks the same once it's frozen. Use zipper-type freezer bags and not storage bags - squeeze out as much air as possible to prevent freezer burn or crystal formation. <br>  <br>  Frugal tips on frozen assets here  <a href="http://www.stretcher.com/menu/topic-g.htm#grocery-freezer" rel="nofollow">http://www.stretcher.com/menu/topic-g.ht...</a>  you gotta scroll way down. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|f73d3d6cfcc5f8a95fa845b8654f00b6aa	Yes, go ahead and freeze the beef.

If you like cocktails, try a Bloody Mary, highball or a Manhattan, each delivers an average calorie count in the mid 100s for a standard serving.<br>  <br>  5 Tips to Curb Alcohol Calories<br>  <br>  So how do you keep those calories in alcoholic drinks from adding up so quickly? Here are five tips from the experts.<br>  <br>  1. Alternate alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks to save calories. The savvy dieter finishes one cocktail, glass of wine or beer, then has a "mocktail" -- a nonalcoholic, preferably zero-calorie beverage (like sparkling water with a lime) that looks like the real thing. This strategy not only reduces the risk of over-consuming calories and alcohol, but it also helps you stay hydrated so your head will thank you in the morning!<br>  "It is a good idea to start the evening with a tall glass of water or sparkling water to satisfy your thirst so you won't use the alcoholic beverage to do it for you," <br>  <br>  2. Choose wine, light beer, or simple cocktails made with low-calorie mixers. Just as you might order your salad with dressing on the side, don't be shy about asking for your cocktail your way. "You can save 100 calories if you have a diet soda as your mixer,"  Mix cocktails with water, club soda, low calorie juices, artificial sweeteners or sugar-free syrups for easy calorie savings. Fruit and vegetable juices can be good choices because they are lower in calories than some other mixers and also contain disease-preventing antioxidants. Still, "be careful of fruit juices because even though they are more nutritious, the calories can add up quickly," Some mixers that won't pack on the pounds include:<br>  <br>      * Diet soda or diet tonic: 0 calories<br>      * Orange juice (6 oz): 84 calories<br>      * Cranberry juice cocktail (8 oz): 136 calories<br>      * Light orange juice (8 oz): 50 calories<br>      * Light cranberry juice (8 oz): 40 calories<br>      * Light lemonade (8 oz): 5 calories<br>      * Coffee, tea: 0 calories<br>      * Baja Bob's sugar-free margarita or sweet 'n' sour mix: 0 calories<br>      * Lemon or lime juice (1/2 oz): 10 calories<br>      * DaVinci or Torani's sugar-free syrups: 0<br>  <br>  3. Skip the mixer altogether. Try ordering your favorite spirit or one of the new flavored liquors on the rocks. "Infused vodkas are very popular because they are not sweetened but infused with flavors, from jalapeno to peach, without adding any extra calories," says O'Neil.<br>  <br>  4. Dilute your drink. Another option is diluting your drink with club soda or sparkling water. Wine spritzers are a low-calorie standby. And if you usually drink vodka and cranberry, for example, try it with club soda, just a splash of cranberry juice, and a squeeze of lime. Garnish with a wedge of citrus or pineapple to add flavor and few calories.<br>  <br>  5. Have a game plan. Before heading out to the cocktail party or happy hour, make sure you have a game plan. Decide in advance the number of cocktails you are going to drink and cut back on calories during the day in anticipation. But eat a light snack before you go so you won't get tipsy with the first drink and it will be less tempted to dive into the food. Always be aware of your own personal limits. Don't drink too much, and, of course, don't drink and drive.<br>  <br>  How Many Calories in Popular Cocktails?<br>  <br>  So just how many calories are in your favorite cocktail?

So do male body builders.|`|6CjDTJskaa	Im going to put it simply, Yes i think they look gross, too much muscle looks disgusting on ANYONE|`|VtqdeSQ8aa	Not as long as they are natural and not using steriods. I admire anyone who puts that much hard work into their body.|`|64554a8e1157e502654f643d0ffe309baa	No, not really. I do strength training myself and I am a woman.|`|u6c5bTbVaa	I don't like how they look, but I totally dig how they're living their life the way THEY want to. :)|`|sWXrnErnaa	I don't personally like the look of female body builders but I think the figure fitness chick look fantastic.<br>  <br>  I think that female body builders look as they wish to look and obviously they compete....many athletes that compete at a world class levels have bodies that look "deformed" think about the female swimmers their shoulders are wider than most men's.<br>  <br>  However it is this malformation of the muscles that allows them to compete at the levels they do, and is because of said competition that the muscles have developed in that manner.<br>  <br>  Looking the way they do has nothing to do with female body builders wanting to be male. It has to do with maximum development of the musculature for competition, the larger and more defined their muscles are prior to competing the better they look on stage when they have dieted down and loss all excess weight.<br>  <br>  They may not look great to the rest of us, but you have to admire the determination, endurance and willpower it has taken to eat right and exercise to have developed and maintained their physiques.<br>  <br>  Yeah as I said I dont like the way they look but damn Iadmire them for what they have achieved....given a choice Id rather look like them than like 90% of the population that it unfit and overweight.....|`|AA11786341	I agree|`|F3LBgfvwaa	No, I don't think it's gross. There is nothing dirty or unhygienic or immoral about it. It's not hurting anyone. So what's the problem? Good for them for doing what they like to do, and not listening to people like you.|`|e5VUwaRsaa	Yeah, the really buff ones gross me out. Nothing wrong with having a fit body, but some people just take it too far.|`|2RzEaod9aa	That's what happens when you take steroids. It not only grows you a tiny penis, but also squares out your jaw. <br>  <br>  That's why I'm all natural. Plus, steroids aren't vegan anyway ;) I will tell you that people who are into bodybuilding (men and women) really don't give a damn whether you find them attractive. We do it for the pump, for the feel of the muscle growing, for the knowledge that we improve our strength. It's an addiction, it's a compulsion, it's a drive and desire. <br>  We don't do it to try and attract members of the opposite (or same) sex, and the women don't do it to try and be like men (seriously, how many men do you see that are that muscular anyway?). Some people are just totally and utterly addicted to that FEELING you get in the gym when you lift until your muscles burn or fail. I salivate thinking about it. I lift weights so hard I throw up almost every time. I'll bust blood vessels. That makes me love it even more. My bodybuilding buddy is the same way, and it's nice to have someone to relate to because most people, like yourself, just don't get it. <br>  <br>  But hey, you could always try going up to a female bodybuilder and actually telling her she disgusts you. Tell me how that works out for you.|`|Qz3sii2caa	Yeah kinda. I mean I commend the ladies for wanting to get in shape and get strong. Bodybuilding is a very competitive sport and it takes a special personality to go through with that sort of lifestyle. But yeah... once you stop looking like a woman, it's like ehhhhh? Some get breast implants to preserve their "womanly" look, but I think it just makes them look more creepy. There's more to looking like a woman than having boobs. I mean there is so much testosterone running around their veins, their skin looses the feminine softness so all the cosmetics look drag queenish. And then the fried, over-teased, trying-too-hard hair. Just creepy.<br>  <br>  I prefer the fitness models. It's competitive and it's still bodybuilding of sorts. They just look like strong healthy women, not men with boobs.|`|b9uOax0aaa	As much as the men bodybuilders look bad the women are ten times worse.|`|VdbhuUYBaa	Yeah, but not as much as trolls who can't figure out their own sex.
Yt8mQK5Iaa	Red chillies.  Garlic.  Salt.  Oregano.  Paprika.  Olive oil.  Red wine vinegar.    ? CupCake ?|`|ToztjpAsaa	Chilli.|`|8serxyLuaa	Piri-piri, peri-peri or peli-peli is the name used in Mozambique and Angola to describe the African bird's-eye chili.    More info at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_bir...|`|4X40yK3Caa	its probably just chili|`|GWQ0uZyeaa	Piri piri is the name of the pepper and we get them in South America too.
VPksp6SQaa	If someone tells you to pucker up.....they want you to get ready to be kissed|`|tm0rUy8raa	Pucker up typically means to prepare your lips for a kiss.|`|MzixfZKcaa	if you're reffering to apple pucker or raspberry pucker, then it just means the liquor is sour tasting.|`|Zirwfsg4aa	when you put your mouth in the "kiss" shape or like when something's really sour your mouth puckers
53giV6PFaa	If you mean Philippines or the correct term would be Filipino food taste good, then yes it does.  I especially like adobo chicken and lumpias.
WwbUyBInaa	Presto was founded in 1905 in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, where it manufactured industrial-size pressure canners, known as "canner retorts." In 1939 the company introduced the first saucepan-style pressure cooker and gave it the brand name "Presto," which soon became synonymous with pressure cooking. In 1949 Presto introduced its first electric appliance, the Presto vapor steam iron, and in the '50s, the company's line of pressure cookers was further expanded to include lighter-weight stamped aluminum models and the first line of stainless-steel pressure cookers. Presto furthered its reputation as an innovator with a complete line of fully submersible electric cooking appliances (1956), the introduction of the HotDogger hot dog cooker (1960), the revolutionary PrestoBurger hamburger cooker (1974), the FryBaby electric deep fryer (1976), and the PopcornNow hot air corn popper (1978). In the '80s, as many consumers were demanding less fat and more fresh vegetables and fruits, the company introduced the SaladShooter electric slicer/shredder. The company's inventive nature hasn't stopped in the new century, either, as it unveiled The Pizzazz pizza oven in 2000. Forecasting the needs of the American consumer and seeking to fill those needs through a consistent program of product innovation, quality manufacturing, and aggressive marketing has been the objective of National Presto Industries for 100 years and will continue to be in the years ahead.
