20090129083618AAoyBrX	Health;Other - Health	What to do about a mentally-challenged girl who screams and squeals in drs. office?	Yesterday, I had to go to the dr's and even under the best of circumstances, that is stressful for me.    I don't like to be around children, or those whom are out-of-control.   To my extreme credit, I didn't say anthing or give the mom dirty looks, ( which is what I NORMALLY would do) because I could tell by the way the child acted, she was either mentally-challenged or autistic.   It was cold /windy/ and rainy yesterday, so stepping outside was certainly not an option for me.    I had been early, and was knitting to pass my time, when they came into the office.   I certainly was not the only one who was affected by her screaming.   I just didn't say anything, nor did anyone else.   The child,a teenager, was non-verbal,and I am assuming that screaming/squealing, was her only form of communication.   Needless to say,when I arrived in the my waiting room/ exam room, I had a pounding headache and no pain reliever in sight.   And,I was on a near- empty stomache,hungry and this child, would not shut up!   (Can we say  " duct tape"???)   I was so mad that her mother would not ask her to be quiet, nor did the secretary ask the mother to quiet the kid down, that I had a difficult time concentrating on being polite to people.   Not to mention the girl was a few doors down from where I was at.   When the doctor entered my room,she had asked why I was holding my head and plugging my ears.   I told her. She left the room and asked the mom if she could close the door,and the mother said " no. Amanda hates that."    Oh well, was my answer.   In your opinion, was i right to be angry at the mom and the girl?   In your opinion, do you think that the mother shoulda kept, or at least ASKED  her daughter to be, quiet in an enclosed place?    Especially around alot of other people?   Other people had children too,and they didn't let the children behave like that!   When I came home I had taken a migraine pill,and ate something,then I was out for 12 hours. I am still stressing over that and have no energy.   I was raised, that if you can't control your kids, keep them at home.   A doctor's office is certainly no place to let your child bother others!    What do you think?    ps, I am autistic, too. I have Asperger's syndrome, and that is why I was there: getting forms filled out by my dr.   I can't handle high-pitched noises and sudden noises make me cringe.   Was I doing the right thing by trying to ignore the child?   Shouldn't the mother at least TRIED to keep her child quiet for the benefit of the other people there?    That is why i am so upset. The mother didn't even consider other people.

We've been holding this title for almost 5 years. As of 2009, D.C is #1. It's from unprotected sex and needle sharing. Am I wrong for saying that most people with HIV are irresponsible? I know some people were born with it. Some people got it by accident. But it seems most people who have are just doing stuff they're not supposed to. Like having orgies with NO CONDOM with people they barley know. Not checking to see if the person they're sleeping with is clean or not.  Thinking "LOVE" is going to protect you from it. It's 2009 and people are still sharing needles. I can't believe that.

In the mornings and during day I feel alot of pressure around it too. I am very worried it could be something serious, ive had it for awhile now. I just had a physical 2 wks ago and mentioned it to the dr. and she didn't seem concerned, although she really didn't pay attention to it either, but said she would refer me to a specialist if I was concerned. She also did the routine blood work during the physical and everything came out good. If it was some sort on cancer in my nose would it show up in my blood work? Thanks alot.

20090129083807AA8vlAs	Health;Mental Health	I need help with study techniques and how to get the best out of my potential. ?	I'm in my GCSE year (year 11) and I'm really finding it hard to focus and concentrate. I'm not amazingly clever and I am more on the creative side of the learning spectrum rather than the intellectual one.      My subjects that I can excel in are English, Media and Drama. During December we did mock examinations which I truly 'screwed instead of getting my predicted A in English I managed to achieve a C! :( This is horrible and the rest of my grades weren't great except Media which was my A*.      I need study techniques and how to achieve the best of my ability, as I have said before I'm not overly smart I'm just average in subjects like Math and Science.       Also I managed to get an E in P.E. even though I got 28/40 in the written exam and people who got 22/40 managed to get a D! It's an outrage. I'm pretty crap during lessons though because I just think that I am utter sh*t and don't bother...         So as a summary I need you people to help me with these queries:   1. How do Concentrate during lessons and do work while not ignoring my friends?   2. How do I excel in not only the subjects I am good at but the ones I find harder.   3. How do I improve my confidence and self belief in P.E?   4. Any good study/revsison tips?

20090129083912AAT4mTw	Health;Women's Health	Progesterone. Do I need it?	Hello all.      I am a male to female transsexual.  I'm 26 years old, and have been on Estrogen, for 10 years, under my endocrinologists care.  I have now, begun taking Progesterone (bio identical).  From what I have been told by some, and from some of my readings; progesterone is an unnecessary additive, in the transsexual regimine.  The male body, produces progesterone, as is, not to mention, but testosterone, would also, regulate, estrogen production also.  Now, my testosterone levels, are in the 30's, which  MAY be, why he prescribed it;  I don't know?  My doctor put me on Depo Provera, years ago, but it made me lactate.  That was the pits!  Besides, that isn't real progesterone, anyway.  I also heard, that progesterone, may be counterproductive.  By the way, I'm taking 100mg a day, of Progesterone.  Can anyone shed some light!?      Thank you.

I've been through a lot of abuse and rape by boyfriends and people. And I know that me still trying to get over my past is playing a role of why I'm so protective over him. And its not just girls either. I don't mind him having guy friends, but I still get a little jealous because they take his attention away from me. And I'm very very protective of myself too. I hate other people looking at me, I hate guys, I just think there disqusting. And I notice I look at girls more than I do guys. But I'm inlove with my boyfriend, and i won't even but just look at girls, that's as far as I go with them. But I just flip out when somebody even tries to flirt with me (Sometimes even girls) or try anything with me at all. And I'm thinking maybe me being so protectvie of myself too could be the reason I'm so protective and jealous over him. Because I care about him just as much as I do myself. I don't know what to do.

20090129084626AAnixLY	Health;Mental Health	How do I asssure my psychologist she doesn't have to worry about me?	I'm not really sure what to do. I recently started seeing a counselor at the beginning of the summer and in dealing with some sexual abuse issues for the first time I felt really overwhelmed. I felt like I was losing control because for the first time since I can remember I was allowing myself to feel. I tried to put control back into my life by restricting my intake (bad idea I know) and that got a little out of hand so in trying to get control over that my cutting became more frequent (at least every other day). My counselor at the college I attend doesn't know that I cut but she did refer me to a psychologist after I lost 120 pounds in 5 months. (I was 285--now I'm 160) I told my new counselor about my cutting (mistake again) and now she won't get off of it. She is constantly saying how concerned she is that I'm going to kill myself. How do I help her understand that I'm not   trying to kill myself but that this is just something that works for me right now. She also keeps asking me to show her--Isn't that a little off--I mean why would I want to show anybody? I don't know what to do. I don't want to lie to my psychologist and tell her that I've stopped cutting if I haven't but I also want her to see me as someone she doesn't have to worry about because I don't want to have to stop going there. My counselor and psychologist are the only 2 people I have to talk to about stuff like this and if my college counselor finds out she'll have to report it because of the college's policy. My psychologist has said she might have to tell my counselor if I can't stop but I can't and don't think I want to. I don't want to lose either support person and don't know what to do. Can you help?

20090129085234AAN2okC	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	There is a tingling sensation in the back of my head/brain...?	I've read the other questions posted about this, but none of them seem to be what I am experiencing.  It feels like there is a small rain stick being tilted in the back of my brain, always in the same place, above the nape of my neck to the back of my skull.  Other ways it could be described are: pop rocks, crackling the back of my brain, or soda with tiny little pebbles in it.  It can go on for anywhere from 1 to 30 seconds at a time and happens at least 3 times per day.  It's happened before (about for the past 4 years?) but only every 4 months or so.  After it happens it literally feels like my brain has been lifted off of my head and is just levitating over it.  And sometimes it feels like it originates in my brain, but then other times it feels like it is swooped up from my right shoulder into my brain.  Also, when it happens, it feels like this fizziness has sucked in all of the mass from the rest of my brain and is just kind of compacting it into this mindless energy.  It isn't painful, just very annoying because I can't concentrate in class.

20090129094854AAgf6lT	Health;Diet & Fitness	Is it ethical for me to lose weight?	For about the last 2 months, I have been doing quite a bit of exercise in hopes of training for a marathon.  As a result of this, my body has needed more calories than it usually has.  However, I am experiencing quite a problem where I am gaining weight at a very rapid rate (I weighed 161 in December and am now almost 180 pounds).  I am still technically at a healthy weight since I am a six foot tall man.  My body's metabolism has been sped up to ridiculous levels, and it is giving signals for hunger all of the time, even though I try to feed myself enough food to only satisfy my appetite.  Since I am only trying to satisfy my body's need for calories, is it ethical for me to lose weight?  I am scared that I might have some kind of eating disorder and I am also scared that I will never stop gaining weight.  I feel like hell a lot of the time and my sleep patterns are becoming more and more irregular.  Has anyone experienced this problem? I have not become any more inactive during the last 2 months as far as exercise goes.

20090129090131AANmQN8	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Any possible diagnosis to this mysterious rash?	I've had a lot of mild health problems lately that I think were brought on by having Mono and the fact that it killed off my immune system.    Anyways, I've now got this weird rash. It started on my side.. Like right on my love handles. Now It's also on the inside of my right bicep, all around my left upper arm (where i happen to have a mole but i think thats unrelated), all up the INSIDE of my left leg (from the ankle to mid-thigh but only on the inside) and sort of randomly speckled on my right leg. It's mildly itchy, but i think that's because it's dry and flaky. It's sort of like a bunch of tiny tiny little red bumps.    I haven't switched laundry detergent or eaten anything different or switched soap or shampoo or ANYTHING like that... I haven't switched medication either.    It's winter here so my skin is fairly dry all over... I do get eczema on my hands from cleaning products, though haven't gotten it in about a year.. and I get psoriasis on my scalp. but no where else for either of them (yet).       Any ideas anyone?

20090129114140AAuqKhu	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	I have a question about being tested for HERPES.?	OK, you guys....I'm in love with someone. And when we met, we both agreed not to have sex until we were married because we want our relationship to be different. So anyway...we're going along like any regular couple would..(falling in love with each other)...but one night we were on the phone and he said he had something to tell me. So i was like "ok, what is it?" And he slowly but surely broke me the news....it was sooooooo hard for him to tell me you guys. But he told me that I was innocent and he loves me and he cant allow me to walk into something without knowing and he NOT tell me like his ex-gf didnt tell him. So....a BOMB has just been dropped on me....but for some reason, i dont care. I love him...ok NOW. He told me that he just found out about a month ago. He heard through facebook that his ex had it( they broke up last year) ..but he's NEVER had any symptoms..no outbreaks...just like back pain or whatever..but of course he didnt think anything of it since he works out all the time.He had already been to the doctor last year for his well-man and everything came back negative.He told me that he wanted a follow up check up and he went back again and the test was positive. Now, if he had contracted herpes last year and he went for a check up, wouldnt i have come back positive then? If you have Herpes, then you have herpes and the test will prove that. Did the clinic make a mistake? I read all kinds of articles about it, "you may have no symptoms at all"..but have you personally EVER heard of anyone contracting HERPES and NEVER having an outbreak within the first months of being exposed????? Could the clinic could have made a mistake by testing him positive? I personally dont think he has it...no bumps, blisters, buring when peeing, itching...nothing. test the first time...Negative. Test for a follow up...Positive. Is it possible, that he ultimately does NOT have it?OR should he go for third test with an actual specialst? Insight please. No rude answers... Thanks!

20090129102358AAJUxi5	Health;Women's Health	Worrying about period coming....Help!?	My girlfriend and I have used a condom every time we have had sex. We have (thank God) never had a mishap during intercourse. There have been times before that we have gotten all worked up about thinking she may be pregnant, and then used a hpt and it was negative, and then her period just came a few days late. She is not on birth control. For a while, we didn't have sex. We just recently began to do so again. We had sex on Dec. 31st, Jan. 10th and Jan. 24th. Her period was expected to come around the 28th/29th of this month. It hasn't came yet, and she tested  yesterday with a hpt and it was negative. She isn't having any signs or symptoms of pregnancy. She actually said she had a little cramping yesterday. We both tend to get stressed out very easily, and worked up. I do believe stress caused her period to be a little late before, and I think she is pretty stressed right now. We were careful about it, so we are sitting here thinking about how it could possibly happen, the odds are very low. We just tend to get all worked up.      What is your input on this? Do you think her freaking out and stressing/ worrying has something to do with it not coming yet? I mean, it has happened before.

20090129111658AA4T9pV	Health;Diet & Fitness	I think I have a severe iron deficiency... supplements?	hello, I am 17 years old, a girl, and I live in Canada if that matters at all.   I have been wondering for a while if I may have an iron deficiency, and if so what I should do about it. I have pale skin, I get rings under my eyes all the time and I am always fatigued. I am also always cold... the thermostat in my house is set at 78 degrees and I am still wearing a winter jacket, wool socks and long fleese pants just to stay at a normalish temperature. Whenever I touch peoples hands, they always remark at how cold I am. I also have noticed that I am almost "shedding" my hair... not like in chunks or anything, but it does seem that I am loosing more than most people. I dont get a lot of iron in my diet or fruits and veggies because they are out of season. I dont get heavy periods like a lot of things I've ready about iron anemia say would cause it, infact I have extremely light periods. Do you think that I should take iron supplements? how about vitamin c? I read that vitamin c helps with the absorbtion of iron.. is that true? I am 150 pounds and 5' 10'', how much shopuld I take? How fast will I notice a difference? how can I tell if I am taking too much or too little? I would rather not see a doctor about it because I think that the doctor doesn't take me seriously because I am in there so often asking about things.

I frequently hear professionals boxers and MMA fighters say that they abstain from sex/ masturbation for about 2 weeks or longer preceding a fight because they feel it makes them stronger.

If so, would that mean that natural bodybuilders could use this same approach to increase their muscle gains?

Hi, yesterday i got a cough assist machine given to me by the hospital because i have spinal muscular atrophy and have a weak cough which means if i get a chest infection i cant clear the secretions easily. The physio shown me how to use it and sorted out my settings. I have the pressures on 30 inhale and 30 exhale. Now i am home and have had a few practices on it, i have made sure that all of the settings are right, when i test it by covering the end of the tube with my thumb the pressures are right (it goes to inhale 30 and then exhale 30) but when i put it over my face and do it with the mask, it only goes to just past 20. Am i doing something wrong? Is it because my lungs cant take anymore air in? Or could it be how my mum is holding the mask? In the hospital when the physio did it on me it went all the way to 30 so i'm a bit confused. Thanks for your help

20090129102558AA3YCD6	Health;Mental Health	Anyone on Lamictal and Remeron?	I am have been on 30mg of remeron for this past year for sleep and it has been good for that.  I have been more anti-social on it, but I had finally been able to sleep through the night without waking up with racing thoughts, so I stayed on it.   I just started lamictal 3 weeks ago for a depression that just doesn't want to leave and panic attacks that occur when I am on vacations or away from home for awhile.  I am up to 50mg of lamictal a night but I feel like crap this week.  Not just the annoying headaches and excessive sleepiness, but also getting more manic at night-  Racing thoughts, and more depression during the day.   Do you think it is the lamictal or the remeron being activated. . . . Both have the capacity to cause mania/hypomania. . . .  I a most likely bi-polar type 2. . .   Maybe these two meds are fighting each other.  That's what it feels like. .. . but it could just be the lamictal . . any experience. . . I know everyone is different. .

I never get sick around flu season, never have gone to the ER (well once i did, when i was 3 because i drank a bottle of benydral...snuck it for some reason, maybe because i liked the taste?) but anyway, healthy, normal girl. I eat constantly, lol. I have been trying lately to eat healthy and all, because I've been concerned about the way i have been eating, with all the fat and junk. i just don't know what could be causing this. I'm 14, by the way. And it couldn't be because I'm pregnant, because  I'm not having sex until I'm married, and i haven't started my period yet. My parents say that its probably just because I'm growing, but I'm not sure. Hopefully it is! Thanks for all your answers! :)

Here's what happened:      I was driving when I hit a sheet of ice and went off the street partly into a front yard. This left my car sideways in the road. My back half of my car was in the road and my roommate was driving behind me and didn't manage to turn enough to avoid hitting me and hit my car on the passenger side behind my back tire. I had come to a complete stop before impact and after the impact when I got out of the car my lower back kinda hurt. I'm feeling kind of stiff today. I guess that's to be expected. It WAS a sudden impact.       Should I go to a chiropractor? I've talked to a few people here at work and one of my coworkers said he was involved in an accident and about a year later went to a chiropractor to find out that a part of his back was messed up because of the accident.      Who will be ruled at fault in this situation? My roommate for not allowing enough space between cars? The officer told him that he needed to allow more space in situations of ice and snow. The officer also told us the statement would be ready on Monday.
20090129103447AAiTZKV	Health;Diet & Fitness	Is my doctor a quack?	I went to go see a new primary-care physician today (I haven't had one in 4 years), and on the recommendation of a friend. Everything was fine until I brought up weight-gain. I've gained 20 lbs in the last two years (From 140 to 160).       Immediately, he launches into a spiel about how weight and nutrition counseling is his specialty. He says he rejects conventional wisdom when it comes to weight loss and says that rapid-weight loss is the best way to go, to be aggressive about it. He mentioned "micro-calories" and possibly putting me on appetite-suppressants, as soon as he's sure that I'm committed to losing the weight. He pointed out that a lot of "medical" wisdom about weight loss is driven by capitalist-sell-you-stuff philosophies. He said that he focuses on the psychological, resisting urges to eat, more son than anything else.       I really liked the doctor, he was very laid back and nice, but I was very put off by his approach to this issue. It just seemed...I dunno, not legit? I've been trying to be healthy for a few months now and everything I've read says that you should only try to lose at max, like 1.5 lbs/week. And appetite suppressants - is that healthy?       My friend mentioned that he's very new-agey and "green," which I don't have a problem with (he wore jeans at his office, which I thought was kind of nice)...I just want to make sure that this guy isn't completely off his kilter.

I am a Christian and don't beleive in giving up faith he will get better. We are moving to a different home this week and I  aven't started packing yet. Next week I will be attending school for a position in my job that I can get a raise from. The following week I will be taking a major licensing test for work too. Among all of this, I work 40 hours and deal with kids, dinner, cleaning, and a disabled husband. My husband has major issues. He keeps saying he will hurt himself. He is a gun collecter too so it scares me. He can be so happy one minute but will snap for any reason. Last night he was happy and I just mentioned that I missed my favorate TV show. He blew up at me and yelled at me calling me horrible names in front of the kids. He said he hated me and wished I was dead. I sropped him off at home and me and the kids took off. We got home later on that night and he was still mad. He locked himself in our room and I slept on the couch. This morning he woke up as if nothing happened, happy again. Also yesterday he couldnt find a paper he needed and he broke furniture and made a huge mess for me to clean when I came home. I am tired of replacing phones, brooms, mops, etc just because he has a fit. I just got back into the church and am really hoping this helps me. I feel that my kids lives are being destroyed by his anger. Is there anyone out there with a similar situation? How do you cope? I am literaly getting sick. I have high blood pressure and suffer from post taumatic stress. I also have had severe dysplasia in the past. I am needing a biopsy for an abnormality in my cervix. Its just too much to handle. I feel alone.

The pain is actually going down with each day.  Even right now, I feel no discomfort.  However, there is some pus forming around the stitches.  I clean the finger daily.  I run hot water over it for just a few seconds, and I let the finger dry, and then I apply a anti-bacterial lotion the doctor gave me, then I put a band-aid on.  The laceration looks good actually, it seems like it is closing up, and looks to be healing.  However, there is pus forming around the stitches, it has been there for about 2 days now.  Also, when I take the band-aid off, the white part is stained with redness, but when I looked at my stitches today, it didn't seem to be oozing.  Should I be concerned?

20090129113628AAt0bYJ	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Red itchy bug bites on arms, maybe bedbugs?	It started about a week ago.  I noticed a red bruise looking bump on my arm and it itched like crazy.  I didnt think anything of and figured it was just a spider bite.  Then a few days later I got one on my other arm and the next night, two more.  They were only on my arms, the only part of my body not covered by covers or clothes at night so i started wearing long sleeve shirts.  Two days ago I decided to go ahead and wear my regular pajamas and I got two more on my other arm.  They are like mosquito bites but bigger but of course its winter time so it cant be that.  I havent seen any signs of bedbugs in the sheets but im going to check the mattress tonight.  Does anyone know what it could be and how i can get rid of it?

They occur periodically through the day and happen EVERY night when I lay down to go to sleep. I am not some creepy porn freak, so that has nothing to do with it.  I would just like to know if this is normal and hopefully how to stop this from occuring so much. If it matters, I am 13.

20090129115601AAmVB7U	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Pains under the left rib?	For about a year now I have suffered from lower abdominal, and upper abdominal pain.      I had always had an uncomfortable feeling under my left/right ribs and in the middle of my chest/stomach area. After many doctor visits, and MANY tests, they discovered my gall bladder had quit working. The Doctor said that is what was causing all of my pain.      I then had my gall bladder removed. While they were in there, they found that I had a 'small, and not serious' uterus infection. I'm currently on antibiotics and treatments for that.       The pain in the lower abdominal area isn't as bad. Still there, but slowly getting better.      I have noticed now that the pain under my left rib has came back. It's been almost a month since my surgery. When I went for the follow up, with the surgeon, he asked how I was feeling and I told him fine. Then, a day or two later, it flared up.      I have been getting symptoms as if my gall bladder was still there. I've been belching quite a bit. I've been experiencing the discomfort between my ribs/top stomach area, and a nagging pain in the left side, under my rib. (Same spot it was in due to gall bladder issues)      I can't understand why these pains have come back? Is it the foods I have been eating? I really haven't watched my diet, and I've been drinking a lot of Orange Juice (Which, I do have acid reflux disease), and I've been eating things such as pizza, chinese, etc.      Do you think it's my diet causing these pains?

20090128085253AA6HyeK	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Medical Standards: Can I join thte military ....?	... with Gilbert's Syndrome.      Had a blood test at the hospital the other day and my billirubin count was slightly higher than normal. The doctor said this was possibly an indicator of "Gilbert's Syndrome" - something that increases the chance of turning slightly yellow when seriously ill (not Jaundice) I'm guessing this is because billirubin is a yellow pigment in the blood. This has never happened.      Apart from that it does absolutely nothing detrimental to you whatsoever. In fact I am currently of well above average fitness and almost ready to apply. i.e. lower life expectancy or affect fitness and recovery.       HOWEVER, I am interested to know whether this will block me entering the armed forces as I know medical standards are high and they are sometimes funny about these things.      Answers much appreciated.

So I finally decided to take the plunge earlier today and "shave it". I was very hesitant about it for a long time; I wanted to, as I pretty much hate being hairy in any way, and in general I'm not (I rarely need to shave my legs, because there's practically no hair there), but I was wondering whether it was "what girls're supposed to do", as an ex told me, or whether people would just think it was weird. After a handful of "bush" jokes from boys and girls alike at school, I figured I wouldn't be the only one who did it and did.    It hurt, and I cut myself about five times (haha yeah, I'm clumsy) but still, it kind of stings and is uncomfortable when I move my legs or walk.   Is this just because it was the first time, and will it go down in a while, or should I let it grow back? I really don't know.      And also. Everyone's seen models and pornstars, and they're really like...'pretty' "down there". Is that the case with everyone? Or is it okay for it to be really ugly? 'Cause mine's kind of wrinkly and loose, especially considering I'm a virgin, so will someone be 'turned off' by it not being perfect when I do eventually have sex?      Hah. That was the weirdest thing I've ever written.      Nothing urgent here, it'd just be nice to know some opinions :)

I don't have health insurance so I couldn't/can't see a doctor.     I don't know if the pain had anything to do with losing the baby.    Well now even after all this time, it still hurts there. Especially if I lay on my stomach or move a certain way.    I want to know what it is and if it's bad.     No smart*** answers please.

PLEASE HELP!?	-i know i posted this a while ago but my computer wouldnt let me read the replies-      I was in a 4 year relationship with my ex boyfriend until he got arrested 5 years ago. Im 25 & he is 27. He was my first love & when he got locked up i couldn't stop crying. He in a dangerous gang, We have some mutual friends(not the gang ones) and whenever some of my friends go for a night out and he's there with friends i try keep my distance from him but i keep getting the feelings i had for him come back to me. When i leave he follows me out to talk. although i still love him i think i did the right thing. Anyway whenever im dancing he never takes his eyes off me,He gets into my face a lot if i dance with other guys, he grabs my arm if i walk away, he has never once hit me though. My friends are under the impression he knows he screwed up badly and he doesn't want anyone else to have me, that he is obsessed with me and that can be a major problem when i am dancing or with other guys would that be true?. He keeps telling me he wants me back and will never let me go again. If im at a bar or something he will sometimes come over a put his arms around me & try kiss me or whisper in my ear, but i walk away then he will try to make me look him in the eyes and tell him i dont love him, which i cant do.He even now has my name tattooed on the side of his neck. I think im attracted to these kind of men because my father is in jail & he is one of the head men in a Latino Blood Gang. Im starting counseling soon so maybe that will help?!   Please give me some advice if you can, thank you so much      -i know a lot of you are going to attack me but all im looking for is some advice-

20090128115743AAJGi7n	Health;Diet & Fitness	How to properly chew and spit?	Chew and spit:   In case you don't know what it is, chewing and spitting is the act of chewing up food, usually erm..."restricted" food items, and spitting it out as to avoid the calories.   I have had this disordered eating for about 2 years.  I know it's terrible, gross, wasteful, etc etc.  I am getting counseling for it, so lectures will be ignored.  I already know it's harmful.  Anyway,  I have restricted to doing only one c/s "binge" a day.  I eat my daily calories in healthy meals, and keep them down.      I have been doing a lot of research on chew & spit.  People are saying they gain weight.  I have actually lost a fair amount of weight, but this worries me.  Do you think these people are being semi-careless and just swallowing some of the food?  Could this be avoided by spitting, rinsing the mouth with water, and spitting again?      Again, no lectures.  Just people knowledgeable about disordered eating, please.      Oh, and if any of you are getting any ideas by reading this...please don't do it.  It really took over my life and it's very, very addictive.  I just hope I will have the strength to one day stop completely.

Whenever she's eating something and it tastes bad, she starts gagging. She hates ketchup, so just the sight of it makes her start gagging and once, she threw up. But when were doing oral, she was BURPING, GAGGING, and DROOLING a little even before we began but she said that she could do it and she tried to focus and breath through her nose. I tried talking to her while she was doing it, but then, it happened: she threw up. Now, she's all embarrassed and everything. To help with the taste, I've been told to dip it into whipped cream or chocolate and have her lick it off and maybe do like a little ritual with the dipping. Would that work?      (Please don't answer: Don't do oral or don't gag her with your penis. I've addressed both of these issues.)

They were living in a not so nice neighborhood and it is just getting worse.My Mom is afraid to stay by herself at night so she built a small apartment which is attached to my house. While it was being built she was all good she had something to do.       Now that it is complete she is miserable. She sits in her apartment all depressed all the time. She tells me she is just waiting to die. She is in good health still drives herself she just refuses all suggestions.       She told me she is very tempted to go back to her house in the not so nice neighborhood. She feels like she can go outside at her own home and piddle. We have 2 acres here plenty for her to piddle on but she refuses. She acts like she is afraid to touch anything like we will get mad no we won't. We are not that picky.       I have wrecked my brain tiring to help her. I make time to spend with her so she will have some companionship I invite her to dinner she says we eat to late. I have invited her to watch TV with us she likes having control over the TV so she refuses.       I am think she is in love with the idea of living in her old home. I think she is struggling with the idea she has to let go of the  past and move forward. She is 77 years old. I am a only child so I do not have any brothers or sisters to help us. Any suggestions? PS nope she refuses to do any volunteer work or get a part time job. And I can tell you now she will not consider any medication for depression.

I watched Oprah's show about hormones and symptoms if a persons is low, I have those symptoms and more. I am bitchy, having migraines monthly,tired,mean,moody,can't get to sleep,no sex drive,heavy periods,cramps,PMS BIG TIME,not caring how I look.       On the show the Dr. had a  patient with pretty much all of the same symptoms that I have and so they checked certain hormone levels with a simple blood test and hers was low so they put her on hormone therapy.       I emailed my Dr. at Kaiser and she said to me lets just put you on Prozac or Zoloft. Unreal! She is and has been aware of my issues for a long time now and so she sent me to the Kaiser OB/GYN and he put me on birth control pills, first off this pissed my husband off cause he had a vasectomy and second I have been on them months and there is NO CHANGE, except weigh gain and I am risking getting breast cancer and other diseases linked to birth control pills. Instead testing me for what the problem is she they just put me on the cheapest treatment and wants it to say that way even though it doesn't help. I need help to find out what tests that the Dr. on Oprah's show said we needed to be tested for, please help and thank you!

But then the doctor was feeling my throat and she told me to swallow and she said that it felt a little bigger than it should be. I cant really remember what she said felt bigger than it should but I i think it was my gland? And then she asked me if i knew if anyone in my family has ever had a disease that i cant remember the name of. I asked my dad about this but he doesn't know. And my doctor gave me a lab slip so i can go have blood drawn tomorrow.  I a kinda scared about getting blood drawn, but I am even more scared about this disease thing or whatever it is. I am only 13. And the only thing that my dad knows about the "disease" is that when someone has it it means that they have trouble swallowing. Please tell me any information about this. Thanks a ton!

20090128114533AAq2nwO	Health;Men's Health	Testicular crawling/itching sensation, what can it be?	I have been feeling this crawling sensation on my testicles for about a week now. I have also felt some itchiness towards my anus. The testicular itch feels like some sort of bug crawling on the inside of my testicles, on my skin. There is also a similar sensation near my anus.       I shower daily and am a clean individual. I looked up my symptoms online and figured it could be pinworms (threadworms). I took Pin-X, readily available over the counter to treat pinworms, but it has been over 24hrs and the sensation is still present. I have also shaved my pubic hair and have not found any pubic lice.      I do not know what else it could be, but other similar symptoms are found in yest infections, but I do not have any red rashes or small lesions. Could you please help me in diagnosing this issue? Any ideas on what it could be? I don't have insurance and am trying to treat this myself before going to a doctor, but that window of time is running out.

Only a little while later i realized that i may die from the naegleria fowleri infection, from breathing in contaminated soil/dust, i ran to my room and blew my nose hard hard hard and did that for the remainder of the night and all today, i had this fear before so for 2 weeks i blow my nose hard-even when there is nothing in it, to clear out stuff, but it hurts and sometimes bleeds, and i am scared i may die from this infection. i inhaled dirt that may have been contaminated as it said in the article. i didn't even clean the particles in my kitchen, my mom cooked and stuff not knowing, today i breathed in my kitchen through my nose again and i am so scared i may die??

What could it be?? could she be pregnant? its not a yeast infection because it doesnt itch and the discharge doesnt look like cottage cheese, and its not a UTI because it doesnt burn when she urinates.

I've been doing prescription drugs that aren't prescribed to me, I've been smoking pot since 6th grade, drinking, and a few other things... Last weekend I finally just hit my breaking point and I haven't done anything since, I want to turn my life around.      I woke up today (my 5th day of being sober) and realized that in reality, I don't have anyone. This entire city is consumed in drugs, even the majority of the football team had to quit this year because of drug testing, and when I come home from school I get to deal with a big drunk of a dad. Drugs are just a normal part of society here.      Well, my "friend" called today because she heard I got a new job. She had planned to spend my paycheck on pot. When I told her she had no place to spend my money she got mad and started telling me how much of a peice of **** my dad was and how he smoked pot all through high school and how he treats me like crap because he's always busy getting drunk. Now it's stuff like this that drives me crazy...      I feel like I REALLY don't have anyone. I don't have a parent, friend, teacher, councilor, therapist or doctor to talk to. I want to get out of this piece of crap town and away from these stupid people, but I have to wait another year. I want to be sober, I want to enjoy life, I want to live! Does anyone have any advice on how to keep myself sane through this year? If you personally have quit drugs, please tell me some things that've helped you?

I started running 3 times a week and bicycling 2 times a week. I go to the Gym literally for 2 hours daily,all days of the week.      I look wayyy more fit then when I first started, but I actually weight 20 pounds more... what is going on?
20090128125246AAKUVso	Health;Diet & Fitness	Weight Gaining foods?	I'm naturally scrawny, I've always been told it's because of a high metabolism. I usually consume quite a bit, not all at once, but spread out through out the day. I eat pretty steady.      Recently, I've had a bad cavity that I haven't been able to fix because I can't afford it. I'm losing weight because I can't eat as much as I normally do. I'm finallly getting it fixed soon, but it really took it's toll on me. I've lost alot of weight, and to most people that sounds like a good thing. But for me, as an 18 male, being 120 is not a good thing. I already had trouble before my cavity just MAINTAINING my weight but now that I can't eat as much as I'd like, I'm quickly dropping pounds.      What are some foods that can hold me over for a little bit until I get my tooth fixed. Foods with alot of starches, protein?      Please, any ideas?

His symptoms were:  Loss of balance-staggered walking,  but he could crawl or 'slump' slightly to the bathroom.  .His speech was slurred but he was totally lucid and suffered no memory loss.  .He was conscious but at times not by much.  .He could talk properly but slurred-he could say things like   'my knee is hurting,please move my legs,sorry'  >he vomited a few times   but now he's fine and is worried he may have damaged himself permanently.

Everytime I take a shower, the second I come out I'm all sweaty under my pits. It's so uncomfortable. Yes I use deoderant but even then it is still sweaty. After I come out of a shower daily in the morning, my pits are like wetish and when I put a shirt on, I get sweat marks. It's not only that it's very uncomfortable. What would you recomend I do? And No Doctor Please. Maybe suggest good affordable deoderants available at places like walmart.       Thank you ?      P.S - I do pick Best Answers!

20090128122951AA0hTI3	Health;Diet & Fitness	Why am i so hungry all the time?	I'm on a strict diet and have lost lots of weight.  I like the way I look.  I'm still losing slowly and want to finish the program, but get derailed all the time because of hunger.  Yes, I consume few calories and am moderately active, but I'm not engaged in hard physical labor.  This diet is very healthy, it's called Optifast, and I do eat either one or two meals a day consisting of meat, salad, a vegetable, fruit and milk. I get derailed by snacking on things like nuts, low fat cheese or extra fruit.  I only have 14 more pounds to lose to reach my goal and it's taking forever!

20090128130310AAgIHMM	Health;Women's Health	Does a girl's hymen have to break for her not to be a virgin anymore?	...because i believe it HAS to break for a girl to lose her virginity. there was a previous question a while back where a girl asked if she was still a virgin or not, she explained they he boyfriend only stuck it in like a inch & didn't break her hymen...so she was confused if she actually lost her virginity or not. & many people had mixed reviews on this subject. many people(like me) said if her hymen didn't break...then she still is indeed a virgin, others were saying ANY penis/vagina action of any kind makes her not a virgin...which i think is silly. you ARE NOT having sex if the penis isn't going in all the way, that's just teasing & foreplay honestly. you can't have full blown sex w/out breaking the hymen & the penis being able to go all the way in! one women stated that her hymen has never broken & she's had sex for years...apparently she hasn't been having sex right lol, unless her hymen was formed far back in her cervix? or she has just been w/ tiny men all her life lol. so yea, this has been a big issue w/ alot of people, no one can seem to agree on it, but that's how i feel about it...a girl can't lose her virginity w/out having her hymen broken...i feel the only case of someone not being a virgin anymore that's that simple is for a guy...there is nothing for him to break or whatever, once it has entered...it's done. what do you guys think?

20090128130758AAPK0QB	Health;Diet & Fitness	What can I do to try to lose weight more effectively?	I currently work out EVERY day (spending at least 40 minutes on a cardio workout). I also do some strength training, mostly on lower back and abdomen.   I drink at least 2 liters of water a day, usually more.   I've cut out all animal fats and sweets out of my diet.   I eat lots of vegetables and brown rice, and I don't eat after 5 pm.    I don't drink my calories, only water.    I don't drink alcohol.   I have dramatically reduced the AMOUNT I eat when I eat. I'm not gorging myself at all, and I eat no more than the suggested serving size.      After a month of all of this, I have gained 2 pounds. And its not just a matter of gaining muscle mass, because my pants are fitting EXACTLY as they did a month ago - WAY too tight. What am I doing wrong? I'm 23, female, 5'9" and about 245 lb.
