I have read lots about this on the internet, and it seems that mostly everyone is warning about extremely high maintenance costs. Some people say they are averaging $2000USD a year if not more. Is this true? Does a 98 328is truly require you to spend so much on routine maintenance? All help appreciated.

20090225081725AAUvoJy	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Radio for a Infiniti G35?	So I'm having an audio finisher problem with my radio. I had to replace my circuit board because the controls on my radio dash would go completely dead my my ac/heat will come on with full blast and I won't be able to do control it because the control board was dead. They told me at the dealer that I needed a new circuit board. I replaced the circuit board for $800 but now the problem is happening again!! They told me this time I need to repalce my radio because the radio is burining out my circuit board and the radio is going to cost $1200. Is there anyway a radio repair shop could fix the radio instead of me going to the dealer and paying $1200?

20090225081302AAcJRA6	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Automotive Fraud, bought a lemon with a warranty dealer skipped town?	My husband bought a 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee at a small independent dealership he purchased a warranty through the dealer so the car was not "as is" it was sold with a warranty.  However when he attempted to use the warranty we found out the dealer never paid the warranty company so they had no record of his car.  He went back so see the dealer in person and the place was gone.  Now, the car is in such bad shape it has been deemed "unfix-able" or at least not cost effective to fix, but he still owes $7000 on it what can we do?????

20090227122417AANoWCu	Cars & Transportation;Motorcycles	How Often Should My Spark Plugs Be Changed? 2004 Yamaha R6?	To be honest, I really have no idea when they were changed last. The bike has about 21K miles on it but runs perfectly - really smooth, exceptional performance and never has given me a hard time nor the previous owner. I have put about 1,500 hundred miles on the bike since I bought it and the previous owner put about 8K miles on it. So between us, that was 10K miles. He said he never changed them so the first owner of the bike probably was the only person who changed it. But I have no idea when they were changed last. Might be 10K miles ago or possibly even more to the extend of about 15 or maybe more.      So I figure it is time for a change but how often should they be replaced for future reference? Thanks.      2004 Yamaha R6.

20090227124921AAMUNL4	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Any suggestions about cause of problem with 1999 ford escort se?	I was at a stop light and my car sort of stuttered and jerked one time, then as I continued there were quiet pops coming from it seemed, below my feet and to the front, near the engine. I pulled into the next parking lot and it continued to make quiet popping sounds when in idling in park. The pops didn't seem to have an obvious timing pattern, but maybe because I was speeding up and stopping, and turning. I turned it off because I didn't want to risk driving home again. Now it will not turn on. It turns makes noise and wants to start, I almost thought I had it a few times, but its missing something. The tow truck driver said its getting sparks and fuel, but no compression. He suggested blown head gasket or skipped timing belt.      What it did NOT do: smoke, overheat, no real loss of power (I kept up to the next stop light), no check engine light, no oil lights, no more sputtering/jerking after first incident.       Any ideas what happened? I towed it home and don't know what to do. Its a 1999 ford escort 2.0 SOHC engine. It has 160k miles, and for the last 80k miles I've only replaced the serpentine belt, oil, radiator coolant, tires, battery, brakes, rotors, plugs, plug wires, and filters.       Any suggestions? I don't need a car too badly because I lost my job, but it would be nice to have. I'm going to use all your insights and call around to repair shops and price stuff out, because it seems I have more time than money.       Thank you!!!

Suddenly, you feel the engine racing and the transmission lagging behind. We see this symptom quite often but what is difficult to determine is what is causing the transmission to slip. Transmissions slip for a variety of reasons including low fluid level, poor vacuum or a misadjusted or defective shift cable.     ok the part about your engine racing but the car not moving is what happens to me at random times ...how can I fix this ? Do I need a new cable how do I get one? I have a 96 2.2 cavalier ... thanks!!!

20090306165335AAAppzR	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Question about registering a new(used)car.?	I just bought a 09 Murano from a dealership (used) on Feb 16th. I traded in my town and country and the dealership agreed to pay it off. I am financing through the same credit union as I did with my previous car. I thought everything was great until I checked my bank account on line on the 4th of this month and noticed that my account was overdrawn by about $400 with an overdraft fee. The credit union had taken the money out for my old car that I traded in. When I called to find out what happened they advised me that they had not received the payoff and were not aware of the car being traded in so they went ahead with the scheduled payment like usual. It turns out the dealership had not mailed the payment till the previous day, March 3rd. Isn't that sort of a long time? They claimed they were waiting to find out the payoff on the car and to make sure it was financed however the copy of the check that I had the dealership fax to me was dated 2/14, 3 days after I purchased the murano, and the finance letter that I received in the mail was dated 2/24. That is a far cry from March 3rd. Thats not the worst part, now the dealership is trying to tell me that I owe them to register my car, that it wasn't included in the contract. I paid a $15 transfer of title fee and was told that the DMV would be contacting me soon. I assumed that the registration had been paid thats why I was only paying $15. But this also comes 2 1/2 weeks later! I am furious and don't think that I should be held accountable for their obvious screw ups. If they had informed me that the car needed to be registered I would have gladly paid for it, even if they told me like 2 days later. But to come to me over 2 weeks later and try to get money out of me I just think that is wrong. After all this ,my question is this. Can they really do that to me, isn't that bad business practice? I know in my line of work (insurance) if I fail to charge a client for something, its my a** on the line. I can't go back to them and say "i forgot to charge you for this, you need to pay now" Am I in the wrong, Does anyone out there work for a dealership and is this really something that I am liable for even if it wasn't disclosed to me at purchase?      Thanks!

20090306173741AAyuuXG	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	This is really embarrassing, but I don't know how to pump gas?	I'm a 24 year old, and I'm so embarrassed to admit that I don't know how to pump gas. I have epilepsy, but I got it under control with medication, so I just got my driver's license. My husband was home on his two weeks R&R from Iraq, so he taught me to drive then and I got my license then, but he completely neglected to tell me how to pump gas. There's about 1/8th of a tank left, and I know I need to get gas, but I'm having a panic attack over it. I just don't want to look like a complete idiot when I'm trying to get gas. I just drove to a GetGo a block away, but it was so darn packed, all the pumps were taken, and I'm nervous about how to pull up to the pump, so I just drove home. I think I'm going to try to go really late at night, like 2-3 in the morning, so not many people will be there, at least for the first time so I can figure out what I'm doing. Please don't make fun of me or call me stupid, since I know that everyone else knows this, but no one ever taught me, so I really don't know. I already fiddled with the gas tank thingy and I figured out how to take the cap off and put it back on, but I don't know what to do for the rest. So can someone please tell me how to pump gas, at like a GetGo? Thanks.
