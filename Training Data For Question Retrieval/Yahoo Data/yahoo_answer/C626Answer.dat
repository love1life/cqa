aDL7xmt6aa	I kept the kids and declined support from her but it wasn't to avoid paying.<br>  You're right.<br>  It takes two and they both have to put up 100%, 100% of the time.|`|rcut6bhoaa	The way I see it....most guys that have to pay support, get raked over the coals.....drastically.  If there were a reasonable amount being paid, and not an amount putting the  father in dire straights, things would be better.<br>  <br>  I currently have custody of my son, and the mother pays nothing.  BUT,  if she were to get the child in custody, there is no doubt I would have to file for bankruptcy.  You tell me.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I agree with you. I don't think fathers get a fair deal when it comes to most child custody cases. Sure, there are dead beat dads out there...but there are a lot of dead beat moms, too. For some reason, nobody ever wants to talk about them.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Just because you know that doesn't mean some men with bad motives do. When a man has had no interaction with the child, a CS issue is filed and suddenly he files for custody, it's pretty obvious what his motives are. <br>  <br>  You don't hesitate to call out evil moms. Don't be blind to dads who have evil motives.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	some men do just that i am sorry ..|`|lN5d688gaa	it's sad and there are deadbeat moms out there.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Been a single parent for over 11 years now..I have financially paid out far more monies over the last 11 years than I ever recieved in child support..I made much less than the other party but still did more for my children in a the long run..custodial parents pay much higher amount of taking care of the children than those who pay child support..end of discussion. One has to add up, housing costs..heating..ac..transportation..food... supplies..special events..educational..basically children are very expensive to raise today..child support only covers a percentage of actually cost.|`|f87bdf8404e183dca258babc57373c4caa	If you read the petitions that have been filed in the last 8 years since my divorce, every one of them filed by my ex was about his not paying child support.  There was nothing filed about getting the kids unless he included not paying any support in his motions.  The situation is different for everyone.  You can't label every case the same.|`|b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	You wouldn't think that if you were able to bear children yourself.Our only concern is for our children not the money like you seem to think it is. My Ex gave me 20 dollars a week for child support that's all he could afford so that was fine by me. We kept the courts out of it and handled it ourselves.You sir definitely have a big problem with women.|`|h4NNeMNbaa	Historically custody has been given to the mother unless the father made a strong case for custody.  Your question appears to assume that this is a larger belief than it may be.  A single case does not a trend make.<br>  ****  MY FRIEND MILDRED SENT ME****|`|63a7e31b3b02cf9de77f9df2e50d7fe1aa	I like your way of thinking!! It is kind of old-fashioned isn't it to think that it is up to the father to support the child. Women / mothers work also and sometimes they make more than the men/fathers.|`|GKPY3t56aa	I agree 100%. Fathers get the short end of the stick in a lot of situations. Judges afraid of taking a child from their mother, but have no problem taking them from the father.|`|AA11319441	For me, it's more than just child support.  It has to do with the time they get with me, the control I get and the like.   I want to raise my kids.  Not my ex-wife and her dip of a husband.
JhvqUvlsaa	Yeah leave them alone for now. If they want to see you they'll contact you. And sometimes friends will hang out with one more than the other for a while but eventually they'll start hanging out with you again. Happens all the time.|`|aC9dBaNqaa	since they are your friends talk to them and tell them how you are feeling|`|AA11265589	You must actively be a friend to have a friend.  Get moving.

3MDY29gnaa	6-8 WEEKS BEFORE THE CEREMONY HUN!<br>  RSVP's SHOULD BE BACK AT LEAST A MONTH BEFORE|`|6zblh7Tiaa	Now, people need notice if you expect them to take time off work for a wedding. We were going to get married July 1st but nobody gets married on a wednesday, more a day for funerals. Good Luck though and Cogratulations.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	6-8 weeks before the wedding day. Replies should be due back 3 weeks before the wedding so you have time to call up anyone who forgot to respond and to tally your headcount for your caterer.|`|fUBWB88laa	We're getting married 9.12.09 and sending them out in July....making sure they're back about 3-4 weeks before the wedding.|`|aipChC3haa	First of all, I like your date!<br>  It's cute.<br>  <br>  Alright, well I would suggest that you first send out "Save the Date" cards, because that just kind of gives them a heads up so they won't plan on anything else on your wedding, but then about 6-9 weeks before I would recommend sending them|`|EKp4Cg0vaa	Sent them out no sooner than the middle of march. Since the wedding is in the middle of the week, you might not want to send the out no later than the end of July. That way people have plenty of time to plan.  Congrats|`|8ilHQMq5aa	since its a weekday id say in june but the typical rule is 6 weeks but id have to say it should be longer for a weekday. at least send out a save the date by then<br>  ps cool idea getting the triple 9s!|`|Wzws8v8daa	you're getting married on a wednesday??<br>  send them end of july.  (6 weeks before your wedding).|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	I got married in September as well and we sent all my invitations end of June-beginning of July.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	6-8 weeks before the wedding day.  Guests need to RSVP one month to the day of the wedding.
5E4t2xqNaa	First you have to understand that opinons are just that, opinions, nothing more.  If you're happy with who you are inside and out, nothing people say about you should bother you.|`|qx4F2SJmaa	Develop a thick skin...<br>  <br>  If you believe your s--- doesn't stink then it doesn't.
AA12384954	I am really baffled as to why you would be concerned about where Yahoo thinks you are.  Yahoo is not really an entity as such, but maybe you need to update your profile and that may assist in some way.  I don't recall ever giving Yahoo an address, and if I did I doubt I gave it the correct information.  Country is all that is really needed I believe.  People are still people first no matter where they are.|`|w5l7De7Daa	yahoo doesn't really care

U8oR3VU6aa	You hit the spot with that question. The answer is every single day of my life. It's like 98% of everything that passes my lips can get misconstrued by someone. When I really start thinking about it, no one knows me, including my family, except superficially. That is sad but it is the truth.<br>  It makes me wonder, 'Do I think differently than other people?' or 'Am I weird in some way that I am unaware of?' or 'Are people so shallow they don't listen--even when they ask a question.'  Yes, I am misunderstood quite often. . .|`|sLmX4H3Caa	Yes. Only three people get the real me. The weird part is they are all girls, and I am guy. Them women folk are genies, ha ha.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ag95riac3OLnnOly.hdWIXTsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220160847AAMGGw8">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|3ZhwIAn1aa	a million times yes i get so misunderstood that i even ask if God understand me because some things that is taking place right now i keep wondering why|`|9zevjO8Laa	all the time!!<br>  my sister doesn't even get me!!|`|zLzwaCpcaa	Yes. It happens a lot. I try and be the realest me I can be, but everyone lets that fly over the head and think that I am only putting on an act. I guess it is from being shy for most of my life so they automatically make assumptions of me. It's like I'm shy but I have opinions too. I am often overlooked by people, never able to give my opinion because people just assume I don't want to talk.|`|tWePoJYNaa	Yes! Of course I have. But I always felt stupid trying to articulate myself and say so. You know? People automatically think that stereotypical thought of emo cutter types when they think about misunderstood. Or that P!nk album.
sMssDP1Xaa	I love her because she gives me what I want as a man.  Don't women feel the same way as in don't you love your man because he gives you what you want as a woman?|`|0fb4FDmDaa	ok ur asking if men just want to have sex? or can they actually fall in love...i have a gf that i love, we are both abstinent, yes alaid man is a happy man and a laid woman is a happpy woman dont deny it cause then vaginal sex wouldent exsist so to answer ur question just as thier are man whores their are sluts and just as thier are bithces their are assholes yes some men do fall in love and some dont even want to some women  fall in love and some dont want to just look at a striper<br>  no offense to anybody just telling it how it is in my opinion <br>  <br>  answer= Yes|`|iFaF3gzIaa	Believe it or not, there are actually guys out there that do love their woman, and respect here. They are a dime a dozen, but they actually exist. It just takes weeding out all of the losers to get to the keepers!|`|ujIeOsDNaa	When I met my wife she was beautiful, smoking hot, I loved the fact that when we went out men would stare at her wanting that booty! I cherished her she was my Goddess!<br>  <br>  Now she's a fat butt and I leave her at the house and chase tail, you tell me?|`|1k7LIZVWaa	Mine actually loves me.  Hope yours loves you too!<br>  <br>  Edit:  I got a letter in the mail today.  It was from my husband just telling me he loves me...He's so sweet!|`|f03edf3d3fe5d3e7c31416dd3871939aaa	I think men love their women|`|6b7eeb4f41fa6f871211ccd21d079e24aa	Both. <br>  <br>  Will always be the same size but get older slowly.|`|4gZYucHMaa	a bit of both but let's be honest, a laid man is a happy man? No??|`|W1rCsvTzaa	I truly love my wife.  I make a great living and look ok so if this was primarily about sex, I would have ended my 20 year marriage in favor of a much more sexualized dating relationship.  <br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong our sex life is still fantastic, it just isn't the same as the deal with a "new" and lets be honest likely younger woman.  Wife and I are same age.  <br>  <br>  So I am with her because I love her, not because she has sex with me.  And if I asked, she would have sex with me a lot more than we do.  But see, she doesn't want to do it as much as me and well, I am not a prick about it because that would just be selfish and not a loving thing to do.  <br>  <br>  One last point and I will end my rant.  My wife doesn't stay with me for "my money".  She doesn't spend it liek it comes from trees so she is not with me for what she can "get from me" either.  Funny thing how that works eh?|`|CVdcrY3kaa	My husband would probably say "both". Maybe that's bad, but I know he loves me...can't deny he loves being taken care of though. That's just who I am though, I love taking care of others. I don't think it's a bad thing, his love for me is unconditional.|`|nqcnylFpaa	yes i love my wife she's the only person i have ever loved i would give my own life for her to live|`|GWRP3vLQaa	I am pretty sure is is both. And maybe not equally...|`|QCfOUgxnaa	My man loves me!!
1405b50b88ea3467bfb41d06509736e6aa	Ok, I'll give this a stab.....I'm heterosexual, so here's my take on this:<br>  <br>  Firstly, there's nothing wrong with looking at and recognizing that another person is physically attractive, regardless of their gender and your sexual orientation. <br>  <br>  Look, a beautiful car is nice to look at, or a sunrise, or a piece of art. So why not another person?<br>  <br>  I would imagine the difference would be how you FEEL when you look at them. Do you get primal physical sensations?  Do you feel like you want to get physically close to them? <br>  <br>  And, as far as how you feel when people crack jokes, good for you. While jokes bring levity to our world and we should all be able to poke fun at ourselves and to a certain extent, this whole crazy world, when people make jokes that are downright cruel, feel free to not laugh and tell them how you feel. Not an easy thing to do, but that's what's called courage. <br>  <br>  best of luck.|`|vp4xjqbLaa	How old are you? Maybe your going through a self discovery point in your life...i have been married for 5 years and i see some woman and think wow she has nice breasts *** or what ever...but i wouldn't have sex with a woman that doesnt ever come to my mind.<br>  I guess if you can see yourself having sex with a girl then maybe you are ok with being with another girl...and there is nothing wrong with that.|`|OSjQ86ySaa	confusion happens to a lot of people.<br>  Maybe you just want to explore the same sex?<br>  And I see that your scared to come out because you don't really no what you are.<br>  And maybe you are lesbian. or maybe you are bisexual.<br>  I say whatever floats your boat.<br>  But sooner or later you will find out.<br>  :]|`|r1NYkcKMaa	i feel exactly the same way!!! the guys have to be absolutely perfect for you too? im still trying to figure myself out, but its nice to know theres someone else out there going through the same thing.|`|Zqby1cXpaa	Bisexual, attracted to hot girls an guys or you could just care alot an think its not right to make fun of gays cause some of my friends that are girls check out girls and there straight|`|7acv3iEyaa	Maybe you are bi sexual. I guess you can't ever REALLY know unless you try something with a girl and take a look at how you feel. I have heard that just because a girl thinks another girl is hot, doesn't always mean that she is a lesbian or bi.  Maybe you should test it though.  And you may not want to but it might be the only way.  Don't let what other people think effect you. Plus, nobody needs to know.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|ikGPJEk4aa	This is what life is about, working out who you are, all i can say is experiment your "title" as such depends on emotion alone. If you have sexual feelings towards both men and women but love men that is bisexual, if you love women that is lesbian. So really it comes down to who do you see your future with? Which sex would it make you happy and content to wake up next to for the rest of your life. As for not finding gay jokes funny that just makes you a decent person.So i would call these feelings normal.|`|M8HVkIikaa	HORNY.|`|a60O1sS8aa	OMG ME TOO.<br>  that always happens.<br>  <br>  and i have a boyfriend :S<br>  <br>  but yheea.. . .. i still love boys =3 i just think some girls are pretty.<br>  so i'm not a lesbo. i am very straight, although i do the same stuff as you.<br>  <br>  theres nothing wrong with being lesbo and you cant help it..<br>  so one day if you do decide you're a lesbian, don't try to fight it,<br>  your just perfect the way you are :)<br>  <br>  good luck finding yourself  <3|`|HZgjUguWaa	you will find yourself in due time yahoo  q/a is not the place to search as far the alleged jokes just keep smiling u don't have to laugh unless u want to laugh openly @ the idiots that thought that was funny to begin with. Just keep taking your time & hell ya I like me some buffed model looking men myself.|`|JyrvQBVgaa	How old are you? It's really not normal for a straight person to look at someone of the same sex and think that they are hot. You might be bi-sexual.|`|dE8RxZMwaa	i think you are bisexual but you prefer girls and your feelings can change over time.  and the whole gay jokes some are really stupid and i don't laugh no one thinks i'm gay|`|z5Hl6Bhtaa	Well I'm thinking your Bi-Sexual which is not a bad thing!<br>  Everyone's different and you should be proud to admit your true self!
VvXZFKLLaa	Guys . . . .We look at women like, Women look at shoes, blouses, and slacks. . .or what ever, lol. just because we look or even stare doesnt mean that we are sexual driven towards a pursuit. in other words YES but that doesn't mean that big boobs are a threat!|`|r7yaD6Axaa	Not really all of them <br>  <br>  I grow up with many guys around meh and boy i know wat their thinkking ot it seem dat way <br>  <br>  but u see plp are differents|`|whR6j9JIaa	Depends on how hot the girl in question is.|`|mzHTfCG4aa	yuppp most guys do that.. but they're just assholes:)|`|CbYvXgWGaa	yes omg that is what guys do to me all the time|`|48HKDSR0aa	yup guys do that|`|DbCMizUJaa	I stare, can't help it sorry|`|ZII6YCk1aa	No, and you shouldn't insinuate all guys do something just because of what some guys do.|`|UVUYG5jaaa	yes. and after that? we wonder if you play chess|`|igkbUflbaa	Yes, sorry if you feel objectified.|`|H7ENkTxaaa	Yes  ( sad but true)|`|jRa5ksWSaa	Yep. Happens to me a lot. =/|`|uLHtXibRaa	What else goes thru their minds all day?|`|KVFYJrDJaa	The fact is if you're attracted to women, or even if you're not, nice boobs are great to look at. I don't go around staring like some slack jawed neanderthal, but you can lay money that if a nice set goes by I will notice. <br>  <br>  And if the boobs are comically large (like Chesty Love and her ilk) they're not being stared at, they're being gawked at.|`|hSSBEEFRaa	Alot of guys do, yes, but not all guys, some guys are actually nice and care about things other than body parts. Yuppers =] <br>  <br>  -Sam|`|WoAAdxHEaa	well not me. I prefer a nice booty to boobs anyday. I actually hate boobs. They're stuid and it's crazy how guys' eyes keep drifting south....|`|7sA8HwTzaa	And later they date her just to cop a feel, see them, and suck on them.  They're morons.|`|J4hOL3oLaa	men like boobs. U can have a completely messed up face...but if u have a huge rack, then ur gonna be a popular girl!|`|x68KtQUcaa	SURE ! They do it!!

f0rLZGGaaa	im shy to!but what a lot of girls at my skool do is just durin a weekend or summer they totally change!last year i had a few friends and didnt exactly take care of myself but i changed over the summer and now im totally outgoin and everyone is my friend exept for the wannabes because they get on peoples nerves.u mite b thinkin,"what about bein true to yourself?"im still the same person:random,crazy,wierd in ways,but just more.....out there!shyness can really bring a person down in social status because people dont understand and think we are gothic freaks,but truth is we are just afraid that we will do sumthin rong so we just keep to ourselves so we dont do any rong. anyway its not hard to talk to people.if u talk to diffrent "cliques"u will eventually find the right place for u.or if ur lucky like me u will find several places to belong and get along with everyone!yea,u mite get a few attitudes and snears but once u have a group to back u up its totally worth it!<br>  <br>  have fun and live life to the fullest!|`|w5l7De7Daa	well you're probably fat.|`|d628b79aa189132128996b6ceaeb2761aa	I'm sorry for your troubles.<br>  But it does get better, dear. Believe me. The smart lonely people in school usually turn out to be the coolest adults.<br>  I know it feels like everything is bad now but in a few years your life will be so much better.<br>  In the meantine, try not to be so down on yourself. Don't let the opinions of others guide your feelings. Ultimately the only person you ever have to answer to is yourself.<br>  Big D
6NSHqwXOaa	1. I said this a lot to one of my girlfriends. He's saying it because he cares so much and likes/loves you so much that he feels he can't do enough to make you happy, feel special, etc. He cares and this is almost his way of saying that you deserve the best.<br>  <br>  2. He probably means that he's been thinking of you. And he wants to know if you're still upset with him or not. Maybe it's his way of easing back into happy talk.|`|a0S75L1faa	well as for the second part idk what he means but he just REALLY cares for you i can tell just from what you told hes thinking of you he doesn't want you to miss out he want whats best for you and he doesn't think hes it but its your life do what you want|`|VlypxvIdaa	the same thing happened me a while back. when it happened me he was saying stuff like that for a long while and one of the things was that he wasn't good enough for me, soon after i realized he does love me but wasn't up for a rrelationshipnd he was saying stuff like that so that i would leave him and he wouldn't have to hurt me in the proses. so i broke up with him to give him some space, we still called each other a lot but he was swamped with work and other things but now where back together and its grand. so maybe hes just trying not to hurt you and make you think you don't want or need him?but then again he might really think that theres better then him for you? i don't know but i hope i was of some help.<br>  <br>  i wish you the best of luck.|`|vDAfx6kOaa	he's not that into you<br>  he just wants to string you along incase he might want to be with you some day <br>  give it up girley|`|PyJa18Coaa	1. he wants you to correct him and say how much you like him and stuff<br>  <br>  2. he misses you lol|`|CORGCUL1aa	1.  He wants to test and see if you can say the right words to him..<br>  <br>  2.  Just saying that he "missed you"

f2fyXyulaa	Well Kayle is obviously not her best friend. Or shouldn't be anymore. Best friends don't do that to each other. As far as forgiving? Yes, Roxy should forgive Kayle but not forget the incident. Cause now, what prove is there that Kayle won't do it again? Just forgive, move on, but don't forget. But more importantly, don't use this incident to make her feel guilty. It's not worth it.|`|TEE4sJscaa	She was trying to rationalize why her friend would do this to her. Let her decide on her own whether it should cost her a friend or not.|`|YNKQf07Daa	too confusing!!!|`|ZRS0C1CXaa	I would have dropped her like i have done many times before with my so called friends. she didn't forget it she is just going to use it against her later.|`|RGRyDqBdaa	If she was a true friend...she wouldn't have made the sight.|`|xZJRUnjjaa	Okay so none of that made sense. Use your grammer sweetie.
AA12384954	Well, nothing like letting everyone else make up your mind for you is there?  Look you shouldn't make these decisions lightly.  It was shallow of you to go steady with a guy just because you wanted to hang out with his friends.  Try to follow the rule ...<br>  <br>  If you're not sure DON'T!<br>  <br>  That is the safest option.<br>  <br>  Now, you have probably grown to like him a little more, but the best thing to do now is be respectful (as you haven't until now) and talk to him about that you would like to remain friends, but it just isn't happening for you, that you don't like being "steady."  He probably won't be happy with you, but that's life, that happens sometimes.  Certainly don't continue with things the way they are.|`|mMBWkEqEaa	its not fair to him. you should tell him so you both can find someone who you really like and who really likes you.|`|ygnShzmraa	Ok, You like him a little and not. Also I would rather say yes too. But tell him the truth. Tell him that you like him a little and don't like him a little. Also I think that when you get apart it hurts your feelings. Because maybe your worried about him. Tell him that you dont want him to go. Ok? Hope that helped! :D|`|6GpN0NOIaa	stay with him if u stay with him  hell know u like him youll fall for him for real eventualy and keep him till some one ease comes along u actuly have a chance with|`|f0rLZGGaaa	tell him whats goin on and see if ya'll can work it out.if he gets mad or doesnt want to them hes not worth worryin over and u should break up with him
XcxL6ZMqaa	im sorry and i think you should break up w/ him. i hope someone else helps!!|`|8V39PymEaa	hes being fake|`|N7NdDtpHaa	Maybe he's embarrassed about something that you do and doesn't want others too see when your with him. Or he sees you as someone lower in status, like hes trying too protect his reputation or what not or the other way around like a jealousy thing. Well whatever it is try talking too him about it. All I suggest, hope things work out between you and your friend :)|`|0VsX3vGzaa	I wouldn't be friends with him anymore.
MlCWsBcwaa	Maybe just give it a bit of time and see how it goes and how you feel about each other as you get to know each other a bit better.  Not easy to do if you like him, but it might help to take things a bit easy as you have just met.  I think try to spend time together and see how it goes.  Good luck.|`|ua1WEb1saa	coyly ask him who he would date that he knew, and if he asks you, say him. flirt a little at first, and gradually work your way up :]|`|e0qGLxmiaa	try to avoid him and see if he follows u still|`|z5Hl6Bhtaa	Well start being flirty and fun. And when you feel comfortable enough with him and you feel like it could go somewhere ask him how he feels!
vvB6zKb7aa	First of all hitting back just lowers you to there standard. and biting is as low as you can get! try to find away to get in to there brain by just talking to them and lead them in to talking about things that bug her. She needs something that she is not getting. Mom / Dad / Home / Love / something of that sort, these are things that we really do need. And with out them they reach out !!! that was a way to reach out for help. If you have ever been close to your cousin try to think of a special time you shared to gether or fun time that you had together.and bring it up. Tell her how you wish it could be like it used to be, or if a loved one has pasted and left her empty , try to talk talk talk feel in your heart what she is feeling. and you will be able to get a big im sorry out of her and a big hug. she needs help right now to more punishment|`|mtBRZaezaa	Dont do anything to her, and yeah forget the police you can solve this between you and your family ..<br>  tell your mom or dad what your cousin has been doing and keep who you want away from her !<br>  show your parents or the cousin's mom/dad what she did , they will do something!|`|vNprxduNaa	tell your parents about it, and let them work it out.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	call the police!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|5AaMDz91aa	This is tricky.  I reccomend telling your counsealor at school.  Even though you are underage, it is their job to keep you (and your sister) safe.  This can not go on.  I think that your cousin is hurting deep deep down, and that's why he/she is being violent.  Your cousin needs help.  This is not your fault.  Just be sure that you tell a trusted adult.
HZgjUguWaa	baby girl he's got it bad for you !!  Now flick him back your phone #|`|z5Hl6Bhtaa	your in fricken 6th grade!  You can tell if a little 11 year old likes you if he flicks things at you and makes fun of you.<br>  and I think your a little young to be on here missy!|`|jtjISk6qaa	you're 12.|`|7ca00ab095cf88b23620a56d48169edbaa	Oh 6th grade.  I remember back then!  Great times lol.  How about this, how about you just talk to him!  If you like him then start talking to him about things you want to, ask him to hang out, get to know him better, drop some hints that you like him back.   It is only as hard as you make it.|`|ua1WEb1saa	First of all, you have french in 6th grade?!<br>  <br>  But its 6TH GRADE, dude, wait at least untill 7th :)<br>  Make him want you, grrrrr,|`|XcxL6ZMqaa	im sorry and ihope someone else helps!|`|cGCPa8G6aa	Awww...how cute. I have been through this sooo much in middle school. He is definitely flirting with you (in my opinion) if he Is flicking things and smiling at you. Talk to him some more, and take note of his behavior. If he holds eye contact with you, lightly pushes you, or even laughs at pretty much everything you say, he might like you. But there's no way to be sure just yet, he may just think you're cure or fun to talk to. Guys in middle school find it harder to be straightforward about their feelings than girls do, and they show their interest by sometimes being immature, making fun of you or throwing things and such. So that's mainly what you need to look for. Best of luck!|`|8FC2ZaGXaa	it sounds like he's being really flirty with you....sounds like he likes you. when guys sometimes do annoying stuff there trying to get your attention. If he doesn't know you that well he probably would talk to you about hockey and such hes trying to figure out what you like or what you are into. sounds like you have a someone crushing on you.|`|YlOembScaa	He's flirting with you when if flicks stuff at you! thats how boys flirt when they are young! <br>  ?good luck!|`|r1NYkcKMaa	you're in 6th grade? just leave it alone. what are you like 11?  kids are too stupid nowadays.|`|nlLaUBblaa	if he punches you then your in the door
AA10996168	show a little more !|`|GQpTI2GWaa	The 'friend zone' is a bad place to be. Once in you may never leave, except with the help of alcohol.|`|sLmX4H3Caa	Nothing. If it is ment to be, the blocks will fall into place.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ag95riac3OLnnOly.hdWIXTsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220160847AAMGGw8">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|4bd6769f9391604a128cb5de3e4b5085aa	I am attracted to women I find beautiful. There aren't a lot of girls that I maintain a relationship with that I am strictly resigned to being a friend with. Most girls in my life I have some desire to date, in some sense as dictated by circumstances. (as in if I am dating a girl I deem an 8, I might be interested in trying to go out with a 6, but I'm not going to be interested in the 6 so long as I've got a good thing going with the 8)<br>  <br>  Anyway, my point is that the girls I'm just friends with are either totally unattractive to me in a physical sense, in which case I won't become attracted to her, or I'm with someone who I like better, in which case you'd have to wait for things to fall apart with the person he's got who's "better for him" right now.<br>  <br>  So, while it got a thumbs down, I do essentially agree with the first answerer. She'd have to be pretty.|`|HMzUeqTmaa	Tell me the truth about her feelings|`|e0f49fac888b43634b65ba1815b4cab0aa	she shld just be herself|`|bNx1q5oWaa	show me that u really care 4 me|`|54qBK15laa	She would have to talk or text u all the time.  She would have to tell me about herself and listen to me.  Bringing out a guys sensative side is nice too.  Also, guys like it when they can hang out with u all the time.  Guys hate it when girls go off and hang with their friends bc the guys want to spend time with u.  I should know i am a guy.|`|7ca00ab095cf88b23620a56d48169edbaa	That is a hard one because you can't ever really get out of the friend zone.  Ever, trust me.  I liked this girl, Felecia, and the feelings were never mutual no matter what I did because I am "too good of a friend".   Friend zones really suck.|`|VgiUGqxtaa	Maybe just say..<br>  <br>  <br>  "dude, i like you, not just as a friend, but as in, like like you"..<br>  <br>  when "guys" see you as a friend, unless you come out n say it, you're a friend..|`|WoAAdxHEaa	Look awesome and just connect with me on an amazing level...|`|1guDp259aa	number one she can not be a ***** or a emo slut.<br>  2.. shes got to listen and be a nice and cool person to hang around|`|Zqby1cXpaa	I guess be more flirty, show that she doesnt see me as a friend but something more|`|pqlhPnexaa	show me her inner soul|`|Tr2WTkRjaa	well i talk to her more get to know each otherhang out and stuff im dateing a girl who was my frind for 4 years|`|9VXIfyjvaa	Well first it depends on age. If it is around the age from 12-16 then I could probably tell you. <br>  Around these ages no matter what anybody says, physical features and the way people look DO MATTER. It contributes into attitude and popularity too. So if you are a pretty girl with a good attitude then you have this down already. <br>  By the way : Guys around this age are interested in face, boobs, butt, etc. Hopefully your friend isn't the biggest pervert. Haha. <br>  <br>  Ok, so to exit the "Friend Zone" you have to take it slow. Shortest, about a week. Each day do things like write him notes, draw your name on his hand, stare at him in a different way, call/text/i/m him, and then finally tell him that you like somebody. Don't say who. Just say you like somebody and then ask him if he likes somebody. If he says he does then there is a good chance he is talking about you. If he says no, then he doesnt. Ask him to tell you. He probably wont. So ask him to play a game where you both keep giving hints about the person you like. Take it slow, and if you like eachother then it will slowly fall into place.<br>  <br>  ***BEST METHOD*** To exit the Friend Zone<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK! Hope this helps!<br>  =D|`|vu8JNSI0aa	flirt, drop sly hints, or if your feeling brave invite him (i'm presuming its a guy) to your house alone and show him how you feel|`|e0qGLxmiaa	show me her rack....<br>  if it was big|`|nlLaUBblaa	look good|`|LQrJClYXaa	touch my wiener
7acv3iEyaa	Well first, I have a question for you. Why would you ever want a guy that only talks to girl that are slutty and only wants to do things with them?  That most likely means that if he did notice you, the only thing he would want to do with you are "things"<br>  <br>  But if you really want, that.... then talk to him. Parties, whatever.<br>  <br>  But if I were you, I would find a good guy. <br>  Plus, if other girls seen you with him, they would probably classify you as a slut to.<br>  <br>  Think about it.|`|z5Hl6Bhtaa	Do whatever you feel comfortable doing. Personally he seems like a jack a*s for only liking the sluts :]|`|KWV6ZtBsaa	be a slut|`|zGgUsEmdaa	No, if you want his attention ignore him. He is the most popular boy right? If you ignore him, that will ruin his ego.Most boys can't stand that, then he will try to get your attention. If you just start staring at him like he's your beloved, he'll just think "Huh just like the rest of them". It's happened to me before, trust me hun. xxx|`|7ca00ab095cf88b23620a56d48169edbaa	First off, this guy sounds like a total douche.  But if you really really want to get to notice him, just talk to him!  Come on.   Just start texting him or something.  But I wouldn't bother with him because he is a total douchebag.|`|NGYoZs1Kaa	Why would you wanna go out with a boy who only talks to slutty girls ? then you would have to become one ..|`|xm0kLvnLaa	Get some respect and find a guy who doesn't just like whores. Why would you consider changing yourself for a man?|`|BEoHK8V2aa	I don't know why you would like a guy who only likes slutty girls and partying. <br>  <br>  My advice to you is to move on and find a nice guy who'll pay attention to you, without you even trying. A guy is not worth your trouble if you have to go out of your own way to try and get him to notice you. If a guy actually likes you and is worth your time, he'll go out of his way to try and impress you.|`|YgSrgTFzaa	well he by the way you described him, I would just forget about him he's not good enough for you. He probably just wants girls that look good to him he probably doesn't care about a girl's personality. But if you still really like him, say hi to him every once in a while. You don't have to go crazy and go everywhere he goes but if you pass him in the hallways, just say hi and smile.<br>  <br>  Trust me, in past experiences I've been way too clingy! Guys HATE that! I used to wait for him after classes and I would always walk with him and it seemed like he was always with me. And one day, he was like Sam WTF? You're like following me everywhere. I was sooooo embarrassed after that, we are still friends but i'm no where near as clingy as I was before. And now we are much better friends than we ever were before when I was so clingy.|`|ua1WEb1saa	slowly start talking to him, ask him for his number, then slowly start texting, eventually tell him how you feel buy coyly.|`|XcxL6ZMqaa	move one, they ARENT worth it. trust me. im sorry but i hope someone else helps if i didnt.|`|HZgjUguWaa	u should do these parties etc only if u want the same rep as the other "sluts"|`|GF1PEO2Xaa	Run through the school naked.

I think that since he only talks to slutty girls you should brake that do not turn slutty! You should kind of intorduce yourself to him tell him youre name ask him for his name even if you already know it lol but yeah start off that way! (Im serious if you wanna turn into a slut just becom a prostitue im sure you'll get him every onece in a while)<br>  ANSWER MY QUSTION NOW PLEASE!!!!!|`|rSXRBEaCaa	go to parties...have fun around him!! he will eventually notice you...do whatever you need to do to get his attention....if you need to act slutty, do so...me personally, i dont act slutty...well sometimes i do but i not a whore or a slut...i have fun!! joke with him...introduce yourself and always remember to smile!!<br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|AA12273026	you said he only likes slutty girls, and that's not a turn off for you?<br>  well, i think its a turn off.<br>  <br>  but you need to get his attention and become his friend.<br>  just dont become a slut.<br>  no guy is worth it.<br>  <br>  you need someone who likes you for you and just the way you are.|`|2DbnttgXaa	if you REALLY like him<br>  Make him want you!<br>  Always look good, be flirty, fun, happy, and always make him want to talk to you, look at him & when he looks at you, do a cheeky smile then look away and talk to someone elsee.<br>  see how it goes (:|`|XcgcE3Cjaa	gurl u bet not! never try to get a guys attention by being something ur not. if u got any clases with him try just sayn hey u know a lil chit chat here and there and if he dosent notice u that way than idk. just dont stoop down to what other gurls do cuz ur beter than that i hope.<br>  gud luk!!|`|3aF8VoJAaa	Show him your boobies, duhhhh.<br>  <br>  Hahahaha, kidding.<br>  Dont.<br>  <br>  Go talk to that weird kid in the corner instead, man.<br>  thats the way to go.<br>  <br>  hahahahahhaa|`|q66hhy20aa	never compromise your dignity for one guy who probably wont last more than a week. anyone interested in sluts isnt worth your time. your worth so much more than that loser at the lame parties where he gets drunk when hes probably a good 5 years underage|`|YlOembScaa	If your not that Kind of girl... thats a GOOD thing. all it means is you can do better than him... <br>  --find someone new.. you dont need someone who just wants you because of your actions!<br>  ?good luck!|`|0ZZT0mr5aa	just stare at him long enough to make him notice.....<br>  <br>  then just grin or smile then.... just look back as fast as you could|`|yUGwWOWIaa	Dress like a      .

ebHcrGdpaa	Your friend obviously is having a hard time finding who she is, and she looks at you like someone she would like to be like.  I admit its annoying, but she will stop eventually.  I dont understand why girls get so pissed off when they are copied.  You dont own the right to be the only one to wear certain clothes or have a certain camera.  You probably make her feel really sad when you let something so petty and stupid get in the way of someone who is just trying to find her way.  You need to try and be a better friend and encourage her to be herself, and let her know that its ok for her to not be funny all the time.  Im sure you didnt invent the idea of buying a digital camera.  It sounds to me that she thinks she has to impress you all to be your friend.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	can you say you like a thing ,, but dont just to get her to buy it .. then she wont have the upper hand any more .will she .. try doing .. all the things she does not like .. you know that much about her .. you can do it .. that way she will only learn .. ok good luck|`|Likst1Mxaa	I feel for you.<br>  <br>  Imitation is the best form of flattery... she likes and envies you and wants to be like you! I'm not saying that you'll have to get over it, just thought you should take it as a compliment.<br>  <br>  Seriously though:<br>  *re using the same sayings and things... that's pretty normal. I still say things which are totally not me because i've picked them up from other people. You can't say things like that to her.<br>  <br>  *re clothes... don't go shopping with her. I know she's your best friend, but the more you say 'ooh, i like this top' the more she's gonna copy you or buy the same things as you.<br>  <br>  *re the fact that she's a little chubby and the clothes don;t suit her... tell her. nicely. buy her clothes for her birthday which are her size, style and completely different to yours. Or point out outfits which you think she would look good in.<br>  <br>  *re facebook albums... seriously, how many people actually look at them? If you look hot in the photos... don't worry!<br>  <br>  *re camera... not much you can do about that either. But hey, if you take better photos... seriously, who cares??!<br>  <br>  Good luck babe! Copycat BFF are annoying ;)|`|1RjSWKuIaa	Just introduce her to something new. Something that you haven't done. Maybe once she sees that making her mind and doing something w/o copying feels better since they thought of it. :\|`|nkR4mfVmaa	i have that problem too sometimes. my mother used to tell me that copying is the best form of flattery or something like that. i don't agree with her tho. you friends probably see you look great in the outfit so they think that if they wear it they will look great. Sad thing is that doesnt work. Try going to the mall with them and help them get their own style. Like picking a good outfit for them and saying it would look great on them. If they keep copying get a sort of trademark. Make something of your own to wear, like a flashy necklace, and then they cant copy it.
aDL7xmt6aa	Yeah, Not your problem.<br>  Tell us how that works out.|`|B12E4rYiaa	It's more like being taken for granted than advantage.

You may want to talk to him and ask him why he has such a problem with you and her. Often it isn't just you - it's all the guys. Depending on how old his daughter is.

Just because he is impotent doesn't mean he shouldn't be intimate with you. Does he ever say he loves you or do any sweet gestures like flowers or anything? If he seems uninterested totally maybe the love went out with his sex drive! Do you still love him? If the answer is no, you know what to do!  But seriously, fooling around shouldn't be an option!|`|GWRP3vLQaa	I don't know if your husband has had this problem checked out by a doctor, but if he hasn't, he should.<br>  <br>  My rule is, if you can't be married without cheating, then get a divorce.<br>  <br>  Fooling around might make you feel good at the moment, but it is wrong, and if your husband is your best friend, it probably won't make him very happy. You'd be better off getting some counseling and if nothing works and you just HAVE to have sex, then get a divorce. <br>  <br>  Cheating is bad. Good luck.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	Their are medical options, such as pills that will stop this from happening to your husband. And there are also other ways that the two of you can be intimate.

I'm sure it would devistate you, that he didn't love you enough to just be with you.<br>  <br>  to me it sounds like you have built a marriage based on sex alone.|`|DenLZAL1aa	Sit down and speak to this best friend, and remember, true best friends are hard to find. There are other ways to be satisfied, without intercourse. If you have gone the route of seeing a doctor and sex therapist, ask him if he will be ok if you get satisfaction elsewhere.

Shoot, you didn't have to get married if that is the case. I can't believe I'm hearing this. You haven't had sex with your husband for 15 years so that gives you the excuse to bail out or fool around. Maybe try talking to him or something. You can't just decide to do this. It will be the wrong choice. How will anyone else trust you in relationship? How will you respect yourself when you go into another relationship knowing you have this baggage of leaving just because you couldn't get sex. Maybe you haven't tried enough.|`|AA12252260	30 YEARS?! Wow... I have to say... You've got to wonder what's up with your husband. I mean, I'm curious what the honeymoon was like (though you don't have to answer that!). What does he want from this relationship? Are you interested in having a family...?|`|BgZA7lvQaa	If you truly love him and have put up without sex for fifteen years, do not fool around or leave him.  Get adult toys, try oral sex, and experiment alone or with your husband.  Your husband is supposed to be your best friend.|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	If your husband is impotent, there are other ways that you could enjoy each other physically.  He has hands, he has his mouth, you could use toys...<br>  Try to work things out with your husband, first and foremost.|`|1k7LIZVWaa	Talk to him about it.  There are other ways to be satisfied sexually, impotence is not a reason.  You can still share intimacy.|`|6PhSENcXaa	With the medications out there; there is no reason for him to have this problem.  Unless he has a heart condition which prevents him from taking these medications.<br>  See a doctor then have sex.|`|AA11401294	i don't know where to begin without offending folks. however , I would like to applaud you for your loyalty. that is wonderful!|`|f03edf3d3fe5d3e7c31416dd3871939aaa	get a divorce sex is a basic need|`|pOTigVYPaa	If you haven't had sex in 15 years, why is it now an issue?  When my former husband was paralyzed from the chest down, I went without sex for 8 years.  We could have had sex in different ways such as oral, and there were stiff "sleeves", they were called, that could be placed over the penis so that I could have experienced intercourse, but he became depressed and then figured if there wasn't anything in it for him, then why bother for me.  We divorced a few years after that but not due to sex. He became non affectionate as well and I was starving for closeness.  I can't make this decision for you.  The wedding vows said "for better or for worse."  I broke my promise and suffered emotionally for that.  I now have a wonderful husband but the sex isn't that much better.  You'll possibly trade one set of problems for another in a  new relationship.  I don't believe in sex outside of marriage.  Why not ask your husband how he feels about divorcing?  He may want you to move on with your life or perhaps get help for his own problem.|`|c1qLIB4Eaa	Dear Katrina,<br>  <br>  30 years is not a short period you passed. You are just great. I am surprised that how did you have passed those years.<br>  <br>  But again I m surprised that at this junction why you want to leave so old relations. <br>  <br>  Look for the positives in your husband and try to know the reason that why he has no interest in sex. Impotent is ok but sexual desire should be there. <br>  <br>  Hope you can understand my point.<br>  <br>  All the best and God Bless.|`|AA12389008	Cannot believe that you do not know that there are many ways to be initmate and satisfied other than "sticking it in".  You have more problems, sweetie, that just not getting "it"!!|`|CQsD09D6aa	If there are other benefits to the marriage like a nice home, kids, social standing etc. then stay married but get some side action. If he is a loser in other ways then say adios.|`|trpvcTBiaa	If your miserable then leave but if you do love your husband and enjoy his company then stay and try to find something that helps in intimacy.|`|1KPKEsHsaa	Become a prostitute, since it's all about sex to you. Hey, you'll also get paid, too.|`|W7XImyTAaa	talk  to your man girl cause i know i couldn't never stay with a man for that long with out doing it.............15 years no sex come on now|`|SIdXuraxaa	Could always try asking why.|`|MitVhIK9aa	get him drunk.
WDs4fRoxaa	You know the answer to this question.<br>  <br>  You just came on YA to see how many people<br>  would agree that you should leave your wife.<br>  <br>  You vowed to your wife, and you betrayed those vows.<br>  <br>  Her sister betrayed her as well.<br>  <br>  Now you want to hurt your wife by flaunting your infidelity<br>  in her face for the rest of her life with her sister.<br>  <br>  There could be nothing more cruel, unless it was her mother.<br>  <br>  To leave her for her sister would be selfish and shameless.<br>  <br>  Once there is no more sneaking around, and the passion dies,<br>  you will have destroyed your wife and her sister.<br>  <br>  The family will be broken as well.<br>  <br>  People will take sides & fight over your selfish acts.<br>  <br>  Think about this long and hard. To do this to a family<br>  means there were no morals involved.<br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	you say don't judge me, but every question you ask demands judgment.<br>  <br>  my suggestion is tell your wife and run off with the sister in law.  you truly deserve each other.  i hope your respective spouses take you both to the cleaners where you most profoundly deserve to be!!!!!!!!|`|9mGe5bYyaa	Hey...<br>  <br>  If you love her because she does a good sex with you ..<br>  <br>  that's horrible ... and that's really a big sin...morally wrong..<br>  <br>  Just take a time to decide don't be a passive one okey?<br>  <br>  Coz that might lead you into you know...big problem.<br>  <br>  Just make sure that everything will alright... think of the consequences ...<br>  <br>  Better to it .. or else..|`|IvIatEg3aa	Not trying to be mean, but do the poor girl a favor. Just divorce her, it's only fair. By the way, honesty is the best policy but telling her you want to be with her sister might not be a good idea. It can cause tensions and feuds within her family. I hope everything works out!|`|M5OY8nSHaa	you're a pig
RKhSRMlZaa	Anything is possible.|`|rm1oLtNtaa	Maybe not worried...<br>  <br>  But after 40 years she just might be looking for a little more attention to feel wanted again.  They might just enjoy each others company, and conversation.  <br>  <br>  40 years is a long time to be with someone, i would think (not knowing , I have been married 10) that it might just get a little stale, if you have nothing to talk about except the weather, or if the dog is eating right or what happened at bingo today...  <br>  <br>  I think (my opinion) it is possible for her to love her husband and her best friend... Us women can love more than one person at a time..lol|`|DenLZAL1aa	Yes, as it is possible to love two children, two parents, to friends, etc.|`|veZLfnGFaa	There are 2 kinds of love:  You love your friends, but you are in love with your husband.  :)|`|BItkg1f0aa	Depends. I know my friend and I send texts like that sometimes.|`|AA11401294	40 years. absolutely. she had the time to go over this in her mind.|`|OXxKTM6vaa	Thats normal. I tell my male friends I love them all the time, because I do love them and I want them to know BUT its not the kind of love I have for a partner though. A different type all together.|`|HE56Jra6aa	No... Some people can relate to each other better with puns......
86PFQF4raa	Yes darling,we are really in love.we have no room for doubt here.Our love is real and will never falter.Our love grows more and more each day.We will always love each other.|`|iD4ejChZaa	i think i still am, but i'm sitting on the fence, not sure which way to jump.|`|f03edf3d3fe5d3e7c31416dd3871939aaa	yes I love him still<br>  <br>  but I had to break it of because of his mind games|`|GQUaFGHLaa	Yes, yes and yes!|`|AA11401294	I believe i am!|`|0wdEcNk1aa	We kiss goodnight and goodmorn. We laugh, touch, joke, talk, and cry together. In our years together no harsh words have been aimed towards the other. As each day goes by, I feel more fortunate than the last that I found the person who likes every part of me, inside and out. Am I really in love? What do you think?|`|GBpLZ2REaa	I'm in the process of a divorce and looking back, I don't think I was ever in love.

hkUzSsRZaa	Do the same thing I did with my cousin, get your cell phone and record her singing. After she is done let her hear it and she will realize how bad she is. That is a way to tell someone without hurting their feelings.<br>  <br>  ~Good Luck, Lexi|`|f2fyXyulaa	Tough situation! Ok, be a good friend and just tell her that it's OK. Don't lie to her and say she good cause it's worse to find out that a friend lied to not hurt your feelings. But, if you must, when she sings in front of you...wince a few times. lol jk Good luck though!|`|7c7e9ee35d10a7b0e7e011d66f491c1baa	You don't have to lie to her.  Record her singing and let her listen to it and ask her what she thinks.  If she is as bad as everyone think she is she will hear it and give up or try to get vocal lessons.  So before she ask you go ahead and record her.  If she still think she is good after she listen to it then tell her your honest opinion without hurting her feelings.|`|wPwg8Oonaa	be like.<br>  its a big school , there are lots of great singers.<br>  if she starts to like get carried away, or w.e<br>  you can always just be like, singing's not for you! stick to your day job;)<br>  *but say it jokingly so she gets the idea but doesnt have a nervous breakdown. lol.<br>  mine please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090220172624AAM5Dyu">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|RGRyDqBdaa	Tell her the truth.<br>  But don't be like<br>  "hey your a bad singer!"<br>  just say something like...<br>  "To be honest, your not the best,but your not the worst"<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.
wEFiPb6waa	i bet he likes u as well as u do, but he doesn't know if u like him yet so his trying to find out if u like him, therefore he's telling u all this to test u to see if you'll get jealous so if you do or get kinda mad at him, then he'll know if u really like him so he can go from there. I've done that myself u k, it's a common thing between man we do that a lot if u want to put an end to this just tell you u like him  as well and thing will go from there, i know ur smart girl, you'll manage to do right? so go for it BB<br>   i hope this helped answer your question|`|I7OqMnkfaa	well, my best friend told me every single girl he liked. He only did it to make me jealous because me and him couldnt be together (because i was taken) and so then finally a long time later, we went out. so he still told me about everyone he liked. i asked him why and he told me that he honestly still wanted to make me jealous.<br>  <br>  but you could be right, he might just do it to show you he doesnt like you.. <br>  :/|`|54qBK15laa	I'm a 13-year-old boy and whenever I like a girl I try to talk about some girl and say that I like her when I really don't.  Then, u will get jealous and then u will ask him out.  That's the plan.  A lot of guys do it and it is a way to get women jealous.  and as u can see it works too.|`|q66hhy20aa	he either a) trusts you because you dont have a personal tie to this situation b) trusts you cuz yall are friends c) wants to make you jealous cuz he likes you or d) really just needs someone to talk to<br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|ua1WEb1saa	He might be trying to get you jealous, how long have you known him?<br>  <br>  He may be leading you on that he is a *player* but dont fall for it. He wants jealousy.|`|whR6j9JIaa	Why not just ask him?|`|ikL5ZdfAaa	to make you jealous treat me he wants to get a reaction out of you. i say tell his sorry *** to back up|`|4Q5OwgU8aa	well, if he's telling you about them via cyber chat, that can't be all that bad. and, since they're all engaged, you shouldn't worry.<br>  <br>  and he might be telling you all this because he needs someone to talk to, so you should be honored that he chose you. and if you're worried that he's not interested in you, you should ask him where you two are right now; friends or more?<br>  <br>  and if everytime, its a new girl, he's really not that interested, if he was he would only be talking about one of them. and a 4 year age difference isn't that bad..|`|P85LVLCTaa	he might just want to talk about them, might like you and be trying to make you jealous or maybe he's trying to distance you. are you interested in him and have you expressed interest?|`|AA11043457	No one ever totally figures guys out, and they don't figure out women either, if that helps. He could just be bragging - you know, he is so hot he had all these girlfriends and they were so interesting.  But they are engaged and to someone else.  So what is he saying?  Is he saying that he's not interested in making a commitment?  Or maybe that they are gone now and maybe he is a bit lonely?  Hard to know.  <br>  <br>  It won't do him much good if they are engaged to someone else. When he tells you again, maybe you can ask, "If you were really interested in them, did you not want to make a commitment or what happened?"  It will put him on the spot a bit but it might open up conversation. Could tick him off a bit if he just wanted to brag about all these girls he had.  <br>  <br>  Could ask about what he is doing lately since those girls are engaged.  <br>  <br>  Maybe you should ask first what you think about him.  Is he such a braggart that he would be a pain in the rear?  If so, move on.  If you are really interested in him, then is it possible that  you could ever get together?   You are at colleges in different states so it isn't like either of you can invite the other out or anything.  <br>  <br>  Does he go back home for the summer and do you?  If so, maybe you can say, "we'll have to get together sometime this summer, I don't expect to be engaged by then.  How about you?"  Ha. Ha.<br>  <br>  You know, it is possible that he can't think of anything interesting to talk about and so he talks about the girls to sort of impress you with all the girls he has gone out with.  He doesn't seem to get it that they were more interested in someone else.  So don't sweat that.  If you are interested, you can keep up the conversatins and see if there is anything more interesting to talk about. You may have to change the conversation to him or what he is doing or anything that is funny in class or what he likes the best and why, etc.  With any man, if he can talk a lot, he likes it. But talking is not always easy for them.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|7ca00ab095cf88b23620a56d48169edbaa	Do you like this guy?  If so then why don't you ask him "Why do you keep bringing up all of these girls that I don't know or care about?"  if you don't have feelings for him, just talk to him about it, is it really that hard to show him just a little bit of caring?|`|HZgjUguWaa	whoa girly you are a late bloomer if he's telling u about the other girls it's cuz he thinks of u as 1 of the guys. for real you are really 20 & didn't have a clue?|`|q4MTwvXxaa	i think he is trying to make you jealous...everyone wants something they cant have...so he wants tomake himself seem more desireable.if you dont feel comfortable, you need to tell him.|`|VCzsfVM5aa	hes trying to convince himself hes not gay.

dFHsAXDMaa	I learned a long time to look at things in the big scheme of life.... think to yourself before you argue how important is this in the big scheme of life, you will realize that most arguments are over something completely stupid. If is something you truly believe needs discussing try handling it civilly it will get resolved better. when you argue and accuse you get no where quickly because people stop listening. <br>  <br>  I do home care for terminally ill cancer patients.....and a couple i meant the husband had kidney cancer and they were married 52 years and I asked them what the secret to a great long term marriage is and they told me...... you have to realize it is okay to simply agree to disagree sometimes. never go to bed mad and never forget to say I love you everyday do not take for granted the person you love knows you love them.|`|4gZYucHMaa	I''m in it to the end...<br>  <br>  it's just easier if he folds, my god hasn't he learned anything in our 10 yrs yet??|`|DenLZAL1aa	In the end arguing is a contest of who is going to win. It does not solve the problem, and it is useless to argue. Negotiation, and discussion without anger is much better.|`|7cjqT33Baa	My goal when in argument is not to win, but to be heard and understood.  The argument ends when that goal has been accomplished.|`|GQUaFGHLaa	When we argue noone usually wins. We stop the yelling and then say that we're sorry about what happened.|`|NBAce2AHaa	i know you said ladies but ..<br>  <br>  i usually give in so she usually wins.|`|f03edf3d3fe5d3e7c31416dd3871939aaa	It dosn't get solved it happens again|`|QXoZUZoXaa	No I don't argue until I win, what are we trying to prove, that one is more superior then the other? Not a good thing and this shows disrespect.<br>  <br>  We have different opinions and express our thoughts, if there is good communication in the marriage, which is the #1 key to every marriage, there should not be any big arguments, yes we disagree and I agree to disagree instead of escalating into an argument.  Also a partner has to realize when a discussion is over and not to keep pushing to keep the conversation going.  Don't just walk away, but tell the partner that you don't see the argument going anywhere and its time to give it up.  If this is a subject that doesn't need to be raised again, then don't, let it go.  Let the baggage go..<br>  The partner who gives in first is the smarter one!!!! What is arguing going to do but give you a bloody headache.|`|d39dc2a48a86bf08c5bfb20d68522559aa	I prefer the term "disagreement" to fight. We fight fair. No name-calling, no crying, no physical pushing, throwing, etc. I tell him why I disagree with him and I try to back it up with logic ('cause that's the only thing he understands!). I also try not to argue unless I know I'm right. Hahaha. No. We go to bed mad sometimes, and when we wake up,we find we can talk it out over breakfast much more rationally. Arguing when you are tired is a losing game. Sometimes, in the morning, he realizes I was right, and sometimes I realize he was right, and sometimes...we table the argument for another day 'cause we just cannot agree. If we table it, we kiss and make up. If you argue a lot, that's a red flag, though, that you don't have the same goals.|`|0wdEcNk1aa	i don't fight/argue. I present my thoughts and feelings and we discuss things. Sometimes we even make a list of pros and cons to see what path we should take. It is so much more productive than arguing.|`|1Bs0sNViaa	When we argue i usually stop talking to him until he realizes that i was right all long.|`|BItkg1f0aa	Lol. Most of the time yes. I end it by saying "I love you".|`|wYOAY4RPaa	Umm...I am always right...
wqchA8B7aa	Get out now. You don't need someone like that. Tell someone at your school about his threats of killing himself, and then WALK AWAY.|`|UVUYG5jaaa	dump him|`|a1pmr73vaa	I'll take the latter part of that question first. Obsession is when you cannot function as a person on a daily basis without thinking about an object of affection. Love is mutually supportive, caring, and giving. <br>   What are some of the key warning signs that someone is obsessed? <br>  <br>  Rapid successive phone calls <br>  Unwanted gifts such as flowers, jewelry, or clothes <br>  Restrictive behaviors, like not allowing you to have friends or relationships with family members <br>  <br>  Usually these red flags will occur within days of meeting someone new. The attraction on the part of the obsessed person is instantaneous. <br>  When you are unable to work, take care of yourself, or go about normal daily activities because your mind is constantly on "them," that is the obsession. This is different than infatuation. <br>  <br>   consider suicide threats to be serious and should be taken seriously. Anytime a person threatens to commit suicide, this is a cry for help. If someone threatens to commit suicide take the threat seriously and encourage her or him to get help. Being in love should not mean living in agony.|`|eDP3YU5Laa	Oh that is bad just talk to him.<br>  You cant stay with him forever.|`|Plq0BGSgaa	you need to calmy and NICELY explain that you want to break up.<br>  <br>  <br>  be honest with him not brutally honest.<br>  <br>  <br>  if he says he's going to do something stupid tell his or your parents immediately.|`|zj8HLXI3aa	What a little baby.<br>  Lord.

Being sensitive or crying at a sad movie is sometimes a sign of a great guy.  However, a guy who is constantly crying and talking about hanging himself has major problems.  He probably suffers from depression and may be bipolar.  You can suggest that he see a counselor to discuss some of the problems he has.  It is part of holistic medicine and many people see psychologists today to deal with stress.  They help us learn how to deal with problems we have.  If he gets upset, you can  tell him that some people have depression because of a chemical imbalance that can be fixed with some medication and others are just down sometimes and talking with a psychologist can help them.   Let him know that a psychologist talks or listens to you and that if  you need medications for the chemical imbalance that a doctor or psychiatrist has to prescribe.  A psychologist can't prescribe medications.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you begin to try to extricate yourself from him unless he does go to a psychologist.  That might help get him there.    Never say anything to him about wanting more of a man.  That might push him over an edge.  I am not a doctor but my husband is depressed and bipolar.  He is not normally violent but he is on medications.  Without medications he could be violent.  If you ever argue and he starts to walk away, let him go - don't follow him.  <br>  <br>  If you can get him to go to a psychologist then he would have someone to talk to him and that would help relieve you of some of your stress.  And I know you are stressed by this situation. You have to be.  I have been married 17 years now and this causes me a great deal of stress.  He does a lot of things around the house for me, but I have to handle all problems and in many ways take care of him.  So you do not want to get more involved with this man.  My husband and I have had some good times, but if I had it to do all over again, I think I'd walk away before getting involved. Now we do sort of take care of one another, but I'm retired and he has been on disability for some time now.  <br>  <br>  The headaches may be resolved by some medications.  My husband had severe migraines and his medications relieved some of them.  He takes Depacote which is a mood enhancing medication (helps the depression) but it also helps keep the headaches away so that might help him.  You might even suggest that you go to his doctor with him to let him know some of the headache and depression problems.  You might ask if depacote might help the headaches or let the doctor prescribe something. If the man were more stable then it might be easier for you to back away a bit.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.  I know you are under a lot of stress so you need to have ways to handle that.  Exercise or work out at the gym.  Have some other interests.  Get out with girlfriends at least once a week. You need the time out.  Until he is stable, don't date someone else if you don't now.  You might even want to see a counselor or psychologist yourself as to how to deal with this person as those of us on here just have experiences most of the time.  We are not health or mental health professionals.   <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|g5vQYWrzaa	Yikes, he sounds unstable, can you go to a councilor with him and then slowly bow out. He needs help.|`|6NPv1TKQaa	Aw, I think soft boys are cee-uute. <br>  But, concidering he's "obsessed" with you, than that won't work. What I would do, is find someone perfect for him. Use an online dating site, or something. You know, a softy like him, or a really tough girl. You know what they say, opposites attract.<br>  Than I would have him meet her. Haver a get together, than, talk to him privately and express how much that girl was his perfect match. This way, it will be easier to let you go having someone else so amazing.<br>     This is what i would do. It may be a little complicated, but, it may just work. ;)<br>  Luuuck to you!!!|`|zwvDITr5aa	Get rid of him ASAP. Tell him he's wimpy and needs to see a shrink.|`|FpwRrOwxaa	I don't know. I only went out with one guy who cried a lot and was obsessed. I talked to my parents about it and they said that, if he couldn't be a man and stop crying, I might have to dump him. Luckily, he stopped crying and when he went away on this one trip (i know it wasn't nice but) I 'Dear Johnned' him. Do you know what 'Dear Johnning' is? Well anyway, instead of Andrew, I got James. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped! <br>  <br>  =)|`|7sA8HwTzaa	You have failed to say how old he is, but you need to talk to his parents or friends to keep him from killing himself.  It doesn't mean that you can't break up with him, but you owe him at least the safety of the protection of people who love him.  If you don't know any of these people you MUST report his condition to the police.|`|OcISFpRdaa	suicide hotline...|`|q4MTwvXxaa	just let him go! it may hurt but if you are not happt, then you need to let him go!|`|2MdtxjEAaa	Wow. Thats Bad!<br>  <br>  Well what i would do is tell him that you do care about him but you want someone you can feel good around. Someone who does not cry so much (a man). Just be truthful and tell him that if he needs someone to talk to you will always be there to help him or talk to him and yall can be friends (be truthful about it though).|`|31faac01721214eb794c4aeec80604b5aa	WOW!!! try to wait until he gets better before you break it off but try to talk to him??? and why is he crying so much|`|rghk8yMeaa	slip him some testosterone in his drinks haha!! jk. that would b really bad.<br>  but just break up with him and be honest about it that way maybe he can improve on hiding his emotions and having less of them so maybe yall can start dating again once he clears up his emotional baggage|`|PumDOQC9aa	I think there never a good way to break up with someone that is very obsessed with you .

He might be sad, and why is he crying? Maybe you should threaten him. say, ''If you don't stop crying then ill break with you, be a man!'' That might help also. If you really don't think that he will change then break up with him, he might cry but I agree you need a man! I hate guys who cry for everything...|`|qlSPmuhdaa	Umm I think you should tell like any services or something o-o; and if you want to break up with him just go because it's your decision also if you don't he might do something crazy to you. I advice you not to go to his house to tell him your breaking up with him because he might lock you or something i think you should tell him your breaking up with him on the phone and tell his parents hes gonna do something crazy|`|5v3vflYkaa	Turn him into a man and make him face the truth.|`|FfGIZe7jaa	maybe he's sad about something???|`|2P0uXBCpaa	It's never easy to go out with a guy who has emotional and mental problems. He must have a pretty crappy life and depends on you to make everything better, but you can't help him. There really are no solutions. If you dump him he might do something dangerous. Try to get him with another girl, or even a therapist. That's the best I've got, but I know how you feel.|`|N4JTdvwiaa	ooo not good lol well hes just a little sensitive and DO NOT break up with him cuz imagine this.... he crys alot cuz hes sensitive but yet he has a girlfriend which is a little better... he loses his girlfriend, hes EXTREAMLY sensitive, and he has nothing now. so what i would recomend is just talking to him then do stuff to make him not like u as much and get him angry at u THEN dump him :]|`|UV8WmcABaa	well FIRST of all I think it's VERY manly to cry, it's really stupid to bottle up your emotions as a show of masculinity.  You really shouldn't look for the fake macho type, they'll end up egotistical slime balls :D<br>  <br>  But on to your question:<br>  he seems mentally unstable.  You need to get out while you can.  It's not your fault that he is messed up and it's not your responsibility to take care of him.  It's you lfie and time for you to move on.|`|m3PKdMWBaa	Say goodbye.|`|TAMGy07Daa	Ah, hes just threating himself to keep the relationship alive. dump him. but not cold .|`|fql2t5Rlaa	if your time is over<br>  move on<br>  say why<br>  and leave<br>  if he cries<br>  he will stop<br>  he will perhaps take stock in himself and change<br>  hang himself inst likely<br>  and you must not carry on with loser who bring you down either<br>  love is not based on symapathy<br>  i have had 3 spouses<br>  several; man cried as io left<br>  2 made something after of them selves<br>  why<br>  coz next girl wasnt taking that stuff either<br>  you need a partmer inlife<br>  not another toodler<br>  good luck hun|`|KxH6lDizaa	DUMP HIM. The sooner the better. Trust me. Been there done that.|`|Z5iX8sjsaa	Okay, You need to ask him why he cries & what's wrong. Encourage him to be a man if you would like to stay with him. I know you want to break up with him but you really got to think about it. If you want to break up with him do it, but do it soft & gently. Guys are very hard to under stand but i know you will get thru it some how!|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	Ditch the Zero and get with a Hero!|`|KQGhjVImaa	If you think he might do something psychotic from you breaking it off, make him be the one to want to break up with you.. Don't call/text him as much and when he does try talking to you act weird..so maybe it will send him a vibe that you don't want to be together then he will be the one to end it.|`|9MSeSH5yaa	First of all, if you want to break up with him you have to do it. You should never put others' happiness before your own. We are in charge of ourselves. If he wants to be miserable then he will be miserable but it should not have to be your problem. If you really think that he will commit suicide, talk to his family and/or call a suicide hotline.|`|KaMI67V4aa	leave him he's gay...<br>  <br>  plain and simple he's gay...<br>  <br>  if a guy cries a lot he's gay...<br>  <br>  how man times do i have to tell....<br>  <br>  hes fukcing gay...<br>  <br>  no offense but he's gay...<br>  <br>  am  i right? or is he just gay?<br>  <br>  so there you go he's gay...|`|5JwGaB6haa	try to help him at first<br>  and if u can't than just do what u gotta do|`|EB7adHmyaa	Oh gosh...<br>  :/|`|A7bC2kMDaa	start an argument with him and  make him  break up with u|`|PoYFQ7Mxaa	Run for the hills.

F47MyGDSaa	DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO! I've never really cared for parents that have never supported their children in what they want to do. It's good that you actually know what you want to do with your life, and being an Author is GREAT! You can make some good money with that type of job. If they don't support you, well screw them! Find some other support systems, and start writing! Get a journal, and write at night, or when you have free time. And the 9:00 bed time, is a little extreme, and maybe you and your parents can compromise to 10:00.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and follow YOUR heart.|`|SjEH1Lx6aa	Your parents are just looking out for your best interests. The truth is being an author is one of the most non-secure career choices you can make. 90% of people who set out to be writers do not make it, because while it is true that anyone can write, it is hard as hell to get published, even if you are good.<br>  <br>  Have a compromise...why don't you try to get along with your parents, and go along the career path of something much more safe like a lawyer. Then, when you do get a job, you can be a writer on the side. That way if you get published it will be great, but in case you don't, you will still have a job and a living to fall back on.<br>  <br>  Please do not rebel. It will make your teenage years an embarrassing memory.|`|V74T9JnUaa	are you asian?<br>  <br>  like tyra banks once said<br>  <br>  "if that was me id be in the club dropping it like its hot"<br>  <br>  only episode i watched of tyra banks and shes cool with that speech of hers,<br>  <br>  arnt u a girl? tell them a guy will take care of you so no need to get good grades<br>  <br>  theres no need to rebel cuz rebel when you do something wrong getting bad grades isnt something bad, even if you join a gang- it aint rebbeling to your parents|`|BE2vknbHaa	Well being that your 15 and probably depend on your parents for everything i wouldn't rebel. Wait until your 18 and chose whatever career you want to do. Just because your parents want you to be something doesn't mean you should do because you will live your life being miserable doing something you hate.|`|IvIatEg3aa	Think of it this way: By the time you're 18, they're not the boss of you and you can choose your own career path. So I'd stick with being an author. Good luck!

You have to work on that. Most people do not approach a person if he always has a rain cloud above his head. Misery loves company and everyone tries to avoid that.<br>  <br>  Perhaps, you need to improve your ways, but do it gradually. For starters, try to smile often. Try to be neat and clean too. It's also your outlook in life that would change things.<br>  <br>  I used to be a loner myself when I was younger, but I just had an epiphany one day that I have to change. Now I have lots of friends, which I believe is one of life's treasures and the best investment that you could ever make.<br>  <br>  I do not think there's anything wrong with collecting cats also. Maybe this could be a good channel to find friends like joining an organization that loves cats.<br>  <br>  No one could help you out but yourself, know your weak spots and try to improve on them.|`|hkUzSsRZaa	You don't have to change who you are in order for people to like you.

If your partner, whom you chose to be with, has traits that you don't like, learn to live with them. When you choose someone you are choosing the faults with positives and acknowledging that you can accept the person as a whole. You can't change someone, you shouldn't try to change someone. It is a losing battle. Denying someone something to teach them a lesson doesn't make them reflect, it pisses them off!<br>  <br>  I spent 13 years with a person whose main goal in life was to change who I was and mold me into his ideal of the "perfect woman". He failed. Now I am with someone who embraces the individual that I am, faults and all.|`|AA11635601	Ha!  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Self centered people usually choose the self centeredness over love when the two collide.  Good luck to us all.|`|DenLZAL1aa	Self-centered habits is a developed action, from over time, usually since youth. It can be ingrained enough, never to change. Good luck|`|EioOPbzbaa	It is pretty much a losing battle.  I am not trying to change my husband, in the beginning he was so helpful and did all he could to be an equal partner but after a few months you generally see the real person.  I have tried many things - making a list and asking for help but he gets off on his own thing so I do myself.  It doesn't work to get mad, he turns the game on or plays music, etc.  If you can't get him to think of you as a couple with equal needs you could always hire someone to do his part and let him pay for the help.  He might change his mind as most men don't like to pay for anything.  If a man wants to cheat, there doesn't even have to be a reason, don't let him load that one on you.  You aren't happy and cater to him and you aren't cheating, right?
CpotQhwkaa	it seems like he does like you. i think hes trying to get you to go out with him but hes afraid you dont like him anymore.|`|AA10554783	Baby if he doesn't like you i will. peace out.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	y yes he does but you must ask him out its your turn .. so if you want him do it|`|mIh685iBaa	ohhhmygawwd! he totally likes you! just tell him you like him, and he will totally ask you out!|`|YPs00PQHaa	DUH! when a guy asks you who you like tis obviously so you will ask back and lo and behold,you like eachother!|`|w6lcZiuZaa	He obviously does just ask him out soon before it's too late!

XT81GCu1aa	This sounds like it could get serious very quickly.  I'd call a lawyer- look for ones that are listed under "father's rights."  You should be able to get a free legal consultation.  Then, you could go from there or try to coordinate with Legal Aid if you don't have the money to secure the lawyer.  But!  I'd do this this weekend, and either leave the atty a msg or call on Monday at the latest.  This is definitely too serious a question to leave to "Yahoo Answers", consult a pro.  Good luck.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	yes. You have "set times" on your order so thats your time.<br>  <br>  If you want to have visiting your kids school you need to be added in the orders.<br>  <br>  Thats a court order you have in your agreement.
wol6ECnQaa	Giving away you're virginity is a rare gift. You can only do it once so make sure that it's special and the guy you're doing it with is worth it. Not some guy who has who cheated on you (probably will cheat again), disrespects you (would continue to disrespect you specially after he gets what he wants), and forces you to go beyond your morals (go figure). Look at all the responses here, we're not trying to hurt you, just showing you tough love to wake you up from this nightmare.<br>  <br>  And believe it or not, they're are a lot of other guys out there who would treat you better... Way better.|`|BE2vknbHaa	Just because he doesn't cuss at you doesn't mean its ok. This guy disrespected you by kissing another girl and he continues to disrespect you by calling you ugly. Unless he proves himself to be loyal and inlove with you don't sleep with him. He seems like the type that is willing to dump a girl after he gets what he wants.|`|3ISGQ4Csaa	*RED FLAG!* Don't do it! First he says that he feels that he has waited long enough to have sex! As if you are supposed to give up your virginity cause he "did the time" in the relationship! Second, he isn't very nice to you! He doesn't have to cuss at you to be mean, and the fact that he calls you ugly wether he is joking or not, shows that he doesn't respect you and won't respect you if you decide to lose your virginity to him! Which isnt good b/c he would need to be gentle and sweet to you during your first time! If he doesn't respect you then he doesn't care if he hurts you or not!|`|V74T9JnUaa	well why always wait for marriage for? it doesnt even make sense - do you get paid by the government to not have sex untill your married?<br>  <br>  The only thing being a virgin is helpful for is knowing u dont have stds, but even then you cant be sure<br>  <br>  I guess you want to think to your self "im proud of waiting"<br>  <br>  and when you finally did it when your married<br>  <br>  "whopee!" what a treat i waited untill im 40 to have sex and now what? I lost it all in one day boy do i feel proud"<br>  <br>  dont think it works that way and no one really cares if your a virgin or not if they love you and maybe it makes them a lil better cuz they know u wont have stds but who knows? you could lie to them|`|hHes4d7uaa	do not have sex with a guy just to hold on to him. please don't. you have got to respect yourself more than that. if your boyfriend is not respecting you, you need to get out of that relationship. you will definitely regret not waiting for the right time with the right guy who really treasures you.|`|77NzfiVkaa	NO NO NO!!! Oh my gosh, I am 19 and lost my virginity last year. I love my guy so much and we are going to get married so I know I didn't make a mistake but I still regret it sometimes. If you want to wait until marriage, even if you just THINK you might want to then wait! You will regret it if you don't wait.<br>  <br>  Plus, consider the first person's answer as well, because I agree with all those points too.|`|Molu004zaa	1. He's cheated on you in the past.<br>  2. He's verbally abusive. <br>  3. He's pressuring you to have sex with him and go against your morals.<br>  <br>  Do I need to spell it out for you? DON'T HAVE SEX WITH HIM. Better yet, break-up with him and find someone who doesn't treat you like sh*t!
JINK3IHiaa	Tell him straight up.|`|7ca00ab095cf88b23620a56d48169edbaa	Just tell him to shut the hell up.  You have to be blunt with guys, we don't always get it.   Tell him that you don't like him and that you want him to stop talking to you because he is annoying you.   He will probably get mad but that is where you need to just ignore him.|`|ujG8d3X7aa	awh that's mean...<br>  i think you should be friends with everybody..it hurts people's feelings when you don't want to talk to them or don't want to be their friend especially if they have a crush on you or like you as a friend.<br>  But Since You asked:<br>  1: Don't Talk To Him For A Couple Days<br>  2: Avoid Him<br>  3: after a couple days of not talking to him hell wonder<br>  4: if he asks tell him that your mad or something<br>  5: if you don't want to hurt his feelings then say i dont feel like talking to anyone just please go away<br>  <br>  <br>  Idk<br>  <br>  hope i helped :]|`|hSSBEEFRaa	Tell him straight up, he annoys you (or whatever) and you just want him to leave you alone.

Well, honestly, I think that he might not be the marrying kind... some of them just won't.  He's obviously still in the relationship, so that leads me to believe that it's not really about you, but who knows?  My guess would be that he's afraid of marriage.  And it's not cool for him to blame it on you.  I'm not sure what he's saying, but if he's trying to say you're not good enough for marriage, but fine for dating eight years... that doesn't seem nice to me at all.  I don't know, I suppose you have to decide if you want marriage more than him?  I know men don't like to be nagged, I would kill him with kindness for a while, be sweet as pie, bring home his fave dinner one night, etc.  Let him see what he will be missing, if you two end up breaking up over this.  I guess what I was tryin to say was if you're always at him like "Y wont u marry meeee!!!!"   It will make him not want to.  I wouldn't ever say that.  I am engaged now, and maybe achieved that by never really bringing it up until he did.  Don't know... every guy is different.  Sorry this is so long, just wanna end it by saying if he's really making you feel bad about it, being mean when he's saying he doesn't wanna marry 'cause of you and not him... then maybe you should re-think the relationship<br>  <br>  btw, lotsa men buy the cow after gettin the milk... especially if the milk is really good....|`|S852p6SXaa	hun you been wasting your time with this guy for 8 years,  if he hasn't asked you to marry him then and know then hes not going to ask you at all.  There are just some people who dont believe in getting married, to afraid of getting married, or just dont want to get married because they know their are certain rules in marriage. like if you start a family, hes not going to be able to go out every night to hang with his friends at the club or roam around with other woman. And their are just some guys who are not willing to give that or as they say "their freedom". He has no reason to blame you what so ever, hes just trying to put this all on you to make it seem like its your fault. that your the reason why he has commitment issues.  Now i strongly suggest that you leave this guy behind and find someone who's ready to take that step in their life, cause your going nowhere with this guy and the longer you stay with him your going to continue going nowhere with him. so the choice is yours, you either leave and move on with your life or stay and be stuck.|`|MfcTIdlraa	Like Cece says;  Make like a shepherd and get the flock out of there.<br>  You have a real creep on your hands.  My daughter went with a guy like that for 7 years.  They would fight now and then and he would crawl back.  He called her all kinds of nasty names.  He cheated on her for the last 2 years of their relationship.<br>  Good riddance!<br>  You don't want a jerk like that anyway.  Honey, there is a whole world filled with men looking for the right girl.  You'll find him.<br>  Oh, you're not the one to blame here.  Tell him to look in the mirror for the guilty one!|`|VVF6DJVzaa	okay so i guess your a girl and ur asking Him?? to marry you??<br>  <br>  thats not right...<br>  <br>  Oh and if its on and off its not gonna be too good...|`|8dREUd2xaa	That sure is a good question?|`|BEoHK8V2aa	Simple: he's a b**ch, get over him, he is not worth it. On and off means: I like you sometimes, then I hate you sometimes, so he's obviously not marriage material, huh? You cant marry then divorce, then marry then divorce all the time- and if he blames you after you try your best to be make him happy, well then he's not worth anymore of your time.|`|HZgjUguWaa	baby girl he ain't never gonna marry you either - because u have already done everything he has asked. He's blaming you cuz he knows you won't do anymore about it than u are now & honestly  honey why would u really wanna marry a jerk like that - you think u love him & u may but he obviously doesn't feel the same so baby leave him alone & move forward stay single for a bit & then you'll be able to look back & see what not to do next time.|`|vBvgqjjsaa	Move on.... 8 years is a long time for someone to be unable to commit and blames you for everything.

If you come off as the girl with too many guy friends, or too friendly with everyone, then certain men won't want to compete with all of that.  Sometimes you'll find that the good guys will approach you in your classes or when it's just you and one other person because they don't want to jump into the entire group and get noticed.  <br>  <br>  This is the problem with nice guys.  nice guys finish last because they're timid.  Nice, assertive, confident guys finish with the right girl because they jumped at the opportunity when it came up.  Jag-bags (a.k.a douchebags, douche-hats, tools etc) finish first because they go for it and don't give a crap what anyone thinks...however, many times they don't think themselves.<br>  <br>  The players ask you out because they don't care about competition from your guy friends.  They'll come in, get what they want, and if your guy friends become a problem, they  drop you.  It will be "all your fault", and he will "not be interested in all that drama".  The players don't have a problem competing because they just want their alone time with you, and then your guy friends can take you back.<br>  <br>  Oh, and tickling is a big TURN-ON for many guys, but other guys tickling you is an even bigger TURN-OFF.  Lots of guy friends tickling you and being flirty (even if it's harmless) is read wrong by a lot of men.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you, my dear.<br>  <br>  Blake|`|nBKSMnTSaa	Well Laughing, talking, and smiling is actually something a guy would LOVE in a girl. That brings out the sunshine in them, and makes him attractive. Touching someone, hugging someone, or being tickled by someone is not necessarily "unattractive" either, it's really attractive but it portrays you as a big flirt, or also a "player". Since this happens, I guess the guy players go for you, thinking you can be another person to just chill and have fun with without committing to any long-term relationship.|`|A2GvmCXVaa	well, smiling and laughing are alright.  Touching might give the guys some signals that you like them.  Um, im like that too, I want others to know im a friendly, loving girl but I take notice of my actions.  I wouldn't go around and hug any guy.  Just dont get too friendly with all the guys in college and save the friendliness to the one guy that you really like :)  Its not unattractive, its telling the guys that you are easy to get because you are too friendly.|`|Kd3GRiLyaa	well some guys that like you probably wouldnt ask you out or anything because they always see you with another guy flirting being all touchy feely and stuff tickling each other and the player guys think that because you do that with them they can get at you. so maybe you should try only playing with your girlfriends like that and see what happens.<br>  <br>  goodluck:)|`|IRFe95eLaa	being a huge flirt like that makes you look ditzy and easy...and the players like that b/c they think you're so dumb you'll be easy to get rid of/pawn off on another guy.<br>  <br>  If you want something serious, I suggest you stop being so touchy and giggly and...um...high schoolish.....|`|Q2sy3BGOaa	youre too flirty

Tell Ben that you can be there for him and if he wants to talk you will be there.

Clearly, even with a sick parent you know how you feel about someone, whether you want to be in a relationship with them or not or if its better to be friends. Now as far as you being there for him if his father really does have it, the best way to do that is to be a true friend, call and check up on him show concern, let him confide in you if he needs to etc... That is really all you can do for him and dont bring up your feelings for him because now would not be the right time to do that if he is going through something like this, but also be aware from now on. Dont just put your feelings and emotions on a platter for some guy to stab at because thats how you get your heart broken and thats how you get taken advantage of.|`|QtzuCxK3aa	Give him time to think|`|EtEn5JClaa	just let him think|`|idRJKqHuaa	I know it is hard 2 understand but his dad is under extreme conditions. when he is unhappy and angry it can cause lack of interest in you. maybe if ever he will realize and see that. but when he does try to always talk about him ask him how hes doing and stuff like that.|`|pBG646HVaa	Well, at least you admit that he's not ready to be in any type of relationship, at least romantic.

vbSotVjVaa	Honestly the children are at the right age for you to start another relationship and it not affect them dramatically, with them being 3 and 1 and they are already attached to this new guy you may want to consider starting something with him because there aren't too many men out there who will date a woman who has kids that aren't his and also treat them so well even though they aren't his own. You dont find that in every man. It is definitely time to let go completely of the ex, stop allowing him to use your children, if it won't work between the two of you then the only thing it will do is hurt you and hurt your children. Because look at it this way, if you stay with your ex and you all don't have trust that will lead to arguements and unhappiness and your kids will be able to sense that, and you dont want them around that. If you already have a man in your families life who is positive stick with that, don't go backwards, it may hurt the kids at first that their dad isnt around much but at their age they will begin to grow a strong bond with the new guy in your life.|`|3df62cd5d4c4550eefa351b54399e098aa	Your kids will be happy as long as you are happy.  You say it won't work with your ex and there is no trust.  That would be a crappy relationship to be in.  And your kids will pick up on that.  And do you really want to live like that?  With no trust?  I think you know the answer.   <br>  <br>  Just make sure that you and you soon to be ex keep personal negativity about the other away from the kids.  As long as you both work to provide stable environments the kids will be fine.  Good luck!|`|d8keIF0uaa	I feel for you...You have to do what's best for you and the kids...Only YOU can answer that. Just remember people do NOT change.|`|f0rLZGGaaa	im not gonna lie:divorce is really hard for young kids.but if the kids are attatched to ur current and ur happier then i say current because everyone is happy exept for the ex and if yall stay together no one will be happy including him even if he doesnt know it.<br>  CURRENT!
SOv6I9Wfaa	My sympathies are with your wife. However, I am pretty sure that you can get divorced either in the UK or in China; you would need to check with a lawyer whether a divorce issued by a Chinese court would be recognised in the UK. You also need to consider your UK assets and whether any rulings on them would be recognised and enforced in the UK. It is likely that your wife will get a better deal, financially, in the UK< especially if you have caused the marriage to fail through adultery and other 'unreasonable behaviours'.|`|ZKcg7YV8aa	Nope. You have to be divorced before getting re-married. You cannot marry someone legally otherwise.<br>  <br>  What I would advise you to do is get in touch with the UK embassy and see what they can do. I am sure they can send you divorce papers through fax or mail!<br>  <br>  Good luck!
VjMyHAWraa	Thanks for the laughs! Some of these are really good1|`|KwNpyp3saa	That was funny! :)
WJHriZWjaa	I wouldn't worry about it. She obviously has issues and takes them out on you. You should probably block her from your myspace, ignore her, maybe even lash back at her when she makes a rude comment. It takes discipline to deal with people like this. She can't hate you because she doesn't know you. She only hates what she THINKS is you. Just stand up for yourself and don't let her walk all over you, because she should know that her harassment is not okay. Good luck!|`|7c7e9ee35d10a7b0e7e011d66f491c1baa	Although you don't want to admit it you do care, if you didn't you wouldn't have posted this question.  Don't worry about it! If she doesn't like you and she don't know you it's because deep down she envy you for whatever reason.  You may be the person she wants to be. She may be use to being the "life of the party" and since all the attention is around you and not her she don't want to like you.  You can't please everyone so just forget about her.|`|wTYPomqQaa	maybe she is judging you by appearence maybe you look sassy and thats why she doesnt like you? Maybe you and one of her friends has gotten into  an argument and she knows about it, maybe theres been rumors about you? that she has heard?|`|RXC6NQ4Jaa	you are talking to a guy she likes or have in the past|`|caozd0tZaa	She is probley jelouse of you and thinks you are so much prettier than her :) so thats why!|`|QcJOXHdvaa	ah<br>  the word is out then<br>  <br>  i dont like you nicole<br>  <br>  that girl dont like you<br>  <br>  your mother secretly like you<br>  <br>  NOBODY like you|`|eVK2zZsOaa	She is obviously jealous of you. Maybe you have something she wants or maybe she is just plain old jealous. If you didn't do anything to her, that is the only explanation. Some people are just jealous because they lack what you have and they aren't who you are and they envy that so they dislike you. She is probably just being a hater....I have had a few of those in my lifetime, they don't like you for no reason. If you want to know why she doesn't like you, you should walk up to her and say I heard you didn't like me and watch her squeal. If you don't care, don't worry about be glad that somebody is thinking about you like that.

JtEBaOdjaa	I like that.  Another choice along those lines, you could get ONE letter that is your new last name (his last name). OR A big last initial and 2 small first initials on either side. like say you are Mary and John Smith it would be like this:<br>  MSJ (with the S being really large).<br>  Just to give  u some other options cause I'm not a fan of the ampersand (the & sign) personally.  But if you like it then go for it. The letters are very nice:D|`|28WJwHf4aa	We had a circular, 3-tiered cake, and had the initial S on the top as our cake topper.

You should then try to make exceptions to pls your woman.  Good Luck!  Happy Love Making!|`|AA11621732	Depends on the woman, is she complaining?<br>  Why not spend alittle money and buy her a "toy" that will help her when she needs alittle extra.<br>  And I must say, this is a first... very unusual to hear a man say "I am too tired for sex".<br>  Personally twice a week wouldn't keep me happy, but for some that would be more then enough.
zxQT3Uo5aa	Why wait til the wedding.  Go talk to her now!|`|BEoHK8V2aa	Don't wait until the wedding- you must talk to her NOW! really romantic though if you bust through the door...but that's besides the point. <br>  Anyway, don't do anything too drastic, just tell your girl the truth, and if it's meant to be- it'll be.|`|XT81GCu1aa	This is deep.  Do NOT burst in the church, whatever you do.  That will spoil your friend's wedding which is NOT okay.  The time to act is now, not in front of her family and friends and embarrass yourself and likely get arrested, beat up or both.  I'd ask her to dinner, and then bring up your feelings.  If she sees the light and falls in your arms, let her take care of cancelling the wedding, etc.  But if she's going along with it and headed down the aisle, you better believe she loves this guy and/or is definitely picking him over you.  Also, I know it hurts but if you were so close, wouldn't she stand up for you to her fiance and you would be invited to the wedding?  Think about it.  It seems she is playing you, and you seem sweet and like you deserve more.<br>  <br>  Still, if you love her- I suggest dinner, hear what she says, and then move from there.  Again, do NOT bust in on the wedding, it will make you seem like an idiot.  Good luck!|`|VJmyNztGaa	I'm pretty they don't ask anymore if anyone objects.<br>  <br>  Tell her you love her, or (sorry but) let her be.
ga2i6C5aaa	Yeah so? It's only a one-inch gap, he's not that much shorter than you. I'm 5'8'' and my boyfriend is about 5'4''. We've been together now for almost 4 years and still going strong. You obviously like him, so don't ignore just because of his height, you might regret it one day. Love isn't about height and weight and beauty and whatever, it's about love, plain and simple. Go for it! :)|`|w4ksNNJWaa	Get over your dislike for someone shorter than you, 1 inch is not going to make a difference you will look very similar heights, a foot might.

He can still be protective of you, height isn't a factor of being protective.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, but if you really like him than you shouldn't care if he is shorter than you.

AA10901079	Well its a matter of being honest: with how you feel about your lover; with how open you can be toward them; how much time you could commit to them and yourself; how much they could listen, accept and support you; how much you trust them and to never try to betray you.....etc. stuff like that.<br>  The balance of the relationship is what you give and what is returned.

e8de2966baaeb88154b07130842a8179aa	I agree with you, people are rude and don't respond and make more stress on the bride, it happened to me.  I vowed not to call anyone but we did.  You will get a lot this week, trust me.  If you work with some people who didn't ask them this week and ask to have the RSVP mailed in.  If family have not responded, call your mom or them directly and tell them  you need numbers.  People assume if they are family you know they are coming and sometimes thing if they are not coming they don't have to respond.  It will work out, trust me, it did here.  Good luck.|`|HeB9M5lgaa	Personally, I would be outraged. I would accept the 34% that returned the RSVP then only plan on those who said they will come. Do not order extra meals or anything just in case. Why bother? If they expected to have a seat or a meal they should have returned the RSVP. Just go enjoy your day. More than likely some of the 66% will show up. <br>  Do some of the guests have to travel? or are they middle class people? Reason I ask is perhaps its a financial thing. They may be worried about money of traveling or even of a gift and figured they'll ignore the invite instead say no. That way when you ask them about it they can play it off like they forgot. You could also send some type of reminder. People are busy and it is possible they did forget. If you would like send out more RSVP cards with an extra week to respond. Then go with the final tally. (I wouldn't send them to ppl who already RSVP though.) Good luck and have a beautiful wedding!|`|60052eab38f27341cc86e1493496f261aa	you can say that they are being rude, yes.   you can also assume those people are just not coming, but how horrible would it be for a bunch of guest to show up to your wedding and you don't have enough food to feed 50% or more of the people who never rsvp'd back! i had about 20 some people not rsvp and we contacted all of them to see if they were coming or not.  sorry to say, but you might have to make a night in with your future hubby to be and make a bunch of calls.|`|F8iYNurEaa	I think it is very rude not to RSVP, especially if they DO want to attend the wedding. I would either start ringing around, or get your mum/his mum to ring these people to check whether they are coming or not. You need to be able to give the venue/caterer final numbers and you can't do this when only a small percentage of your guests have bothered to reply. Anybody who you can't get hold of and still hasn't RSVPed by mid-March should be crossed off your guest list.|`|pub2GLZPaa	We sent out about 70 or 80 invites. I think I got 11 back.<br>  <br>  Very rude. Especially when they write "We will TRY to be there", we will "probably" be there, or "as long as ____, I will be there"..... in emails to our family and friends when asked about it.<br>  <br>  Well I can't tell the cater that X-amount "Might" come... so I gave them the numbers for the people who confirmed 110%..... no RSVP, no dinner :) I did give the caterer warning there might be a couple extra though.|`|Wzws8v8daa	happens to every bride and groom.  time to make some phone calls or write some emails.  no people are not rude, they just have other things going on in their lives and forget. give them a quick phone call and i'm sure they'll be apologetic for not getting ack to you sooner.|`|a5DuXeGRaa	Call all of the people who didn't rsvp! they will probably say they forgot but will attend anyways|`|lgxE5nUoaa	You have to call them and find out what they want to do.  I agree, it's rude.|`|nqINitkmaa	How frustrating! I would wait until a week after the RSVP deadline ( March 7th) then start to call people, you can have your mother do it for you or you can do it together, or you can have your future mother in law or your fiance call his side. Its better to do that than to give the carter a false number, you could end up with 20 extra people that you didn't know about! Good luck! Happy wedding!|`|JtEBaOdjaa	You'll receive a lot of them last second. I also hope you made your date about 2 weeks before you actually need the numbers because a lot will come late.  General rule to follow. Set the date 2 weeks before you need them. A week after the due date start calling people you haven't heard from and ask if they plan to attend.<br>  <br>  And yes people SHOULD respect deadlines. Unfortunately, in the real world, people get busy, they lose/misplace the invites, they forget.  My cousin got married last year and I sent my RSVP back 2 days after I got the invite. My mom laughed at me saying NO ONE returns RSVPs that soon.  I didn't want to forget though. lol Rather early than late for me. So I'm with you on that, but unfortunately, not everyone will get it in on time. <br>  <br>  Also, the post office could screw up and slow things down (which is why you give the extra week before calling).<br>  Don't assume that if you didn't get an RSVP back they won't show up though.  Because a lot of them still will and then you'll be short on your catering head count. So make sure you call them all and get a firm "yes" or "no"|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Lots of people should do things that they don't. That's just life. Most people will send their replies in last minute. Others won't bother sending them at all. You still have a couple weeks yet before you need to start calling people so just hold tight until then. After March 1, you can start calling around to see whether your prospective guests intend to attend or not.|`|ZeFyWGOCaa	It depends on when your wedding is. People won't make a definite RSVP answer more than 6 weeks out, regardless of the line you drew in the sand.<br>  Six weeks before the wedding it's time to contact all the people who haven't responded.|`|7efe69c2d9a0b4d3a0798d71a2f5ea43aa	I would call them. have your mom and his mom and any other family members you can make calls for you.
1Z0Lmrk1aa	I'm a white guy who loves hispanic women, lol.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	I'm sorry, but this is a ridiculous question. Yes, many Hispanics like white and other ethnicity's. I am white and I dated a Mexican. I also know many mixed races where their father/mother is Hispanic and their other parent is white. It's questions like these that help racism win.|`|wZVBWX0qaa	Individual people of all races can be interested in other individual people of any race. There's no way to categorize what all "Hispanics" or any other ethnic group are attracted to as a whole. (It would be like someone saying white girls don't like Hispanic guys, when you know *you* do. No one can speak for all whites, all Latinos, all African-Americans, etc.)<br>  <br>  So if you like a Latino guy, just go for it. It may not work out, but he's not every guy or every Latino, and you're not every white/girl-- you're you -- slim and curvy and funny and ready to find the guy *you* want. Don't let anyone stop you. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|XasLRQnXaa	i am hispanic (born in CA with parents from mexico), and i LOVEEEEEE white girls. They are the only girls i usually like :]]]
AA11899732	You wrong you dead wrong. Why won't you talk to the dude? Thats why females like you always end up with the worst person in the world. A Damn shame. Tell him to stop with the madly in love with you thing, because y'all dont know each other like that. Take it slow. You should talk to the dude like a friend first. I dated a lot of girls that I wasn't interested in, I gave them a chance. I wasn't mean like what you doing. I would call them. They soon got a BIG EGO I then stop talking to them, but Karma came. And now they are suffering. You messed up now. You should've called that dude even if you wasn't interested in him. Its gonna be a shame, when that dude come up living large and doing good. He probably a REAL MAN. Y'all girls complain about can't finding a real man, but when one comes up you throw him under the bus and end up with the LOSER you thought was the best thing. Then he be with one of your friends living it up, treating her like a women should be treated. Then you be wanted to go with him but ITS TOO LATE. I don't know you but you got some maturing up to do for real. Because what you doing right now is not a grown azz woman thing to do. Back in my freshmen year at SC STATE(2001), there was a lot of mature girls here. They didn't care how you look or what. They will be cool with you and talk. Make sure to set you straight before you come with the bull$h!t like a woman should do. THey wasn't mean to nobody. They talk to dudes even though they was interested in being with that dude. YOu got girls like you now around here ain't being that type of woman. TOO PICKY and TOO NEGATIVE. God probably testing your behind. YOU FAIL. Now you are gonna end up with some retard who slaps you around, the way you like it. Disrespect you, the way you like it. YOU need to be a WOMAN.|`|AA10382178	do you realy think someone cares? but thanks for the points|`|AA12266360	I may have been able to ready completely through this if you used letters instead of numbers wherever an 'o' was supposed to be.|`|05ebb5848e785314676a1bbb91ab4a19aa	just tell him that u just want to be frends and get to know him some more u shoud go on a date with him and c wat hes like|`|AA12319714	That's just bad karma. You might not like this kid, and you don't have to force yourself to, but the polite thing to do would be to tell him truthfully that you're just not interested in him in that way. I know it sucks being the bearer of bad news, but if you're truthful and polite, he can't ever claim you led him on or anything like that. How would you like it if some guy did that to you? You'd be one of those whiny little girls on here asking us questions about why he didn't call and all that. It takes a great deal of courage to do the right thing sometimes, but it builds character. Try it. He'll probably leave you alone once he knows you're not interested.|`|ba9a94963642c9d37e704f3ad01bda6baa	Just go out with him once and then tell him he's not your type.

b315735ae7d2c28305cacbcb25870bd6aa	I think so too. I married one. I agree with your assessments that to some people, exotic looking is very attractive. I grew up surrounded by so many blondes, they all started to look the same. I just wish people would learn to be more open minded about people that look different.

What may be exotic to one person may be considered common to another.  Most people fall in the average category; however, some of those average people may look pretty through grooming - such as getting a flattering haircut, putting on makeup that looks alluring, wearing clothes that accentuates the positive attributes of their body shape / size, etc.  I find that a good number of Asian women are rather attentive with respect to their own appearances, and that's why a lot of them seem so pretty.|`|AA11152204	easier said than done|`|5bfda35cd49e0f80544182cc0995a3eaaa	I am bi, too, and I think you are perfectly right.

Use your personality, I know it isn′t easy when you feel nervous but you have to try, otherwise you won′t find a good guy if you depend on just looks.. Three: find out how things are going in his relationship. (LATER ON AFTER YOU TALK MORE.) The most important thing is to be yourself and BE CONFIDENT IN YOURSELF..

If he was old enough to say you are too young for him, then why would he ignore you like that. Thats a childish act. He should be bold enough to tell you what he feels about you as in he has a gf and would want you guys to be just friends or you are not good 4 him or  something than to go and tell other people.<br>  Nice, you said you like him not love him. You could give him some space and move on with your studies. Don't fall in love at this stage cos it involves so many responsibilities which are for mature minds. You could just have close friends of both sex and study their likes and dislikes. So when you eventually fall in love(though not now), you would get the right qualities.<br>  So, don't worry about Chris, if he wants to be your friend, just friend, he would talk to you. If you continue saying hi to him without any response from him, then it would look like you are pestering him or pushing yourself on him. Just behave normal. Good luck.|`|AA10313959	if he says she's too young and he's seeing someone it means move on especially if he doesn't talk to you he doesn't like you. find a guy who's available, your age and that you like who likes you back.|`|AA10779654	love a guy? you really need help!

If you are dealing with a guy who can look at the positives and accept you for who you are which would be a mature one then the answer is yes. <br>  <br>  But then you have some guys who doesn't want to date a girl who is taller then them. It all depends on what they are looking for in a woman.<br>  <br>  I know a guy who dates a girl who has him by at least 4 inches and even more with hills on. When they go out people make jokes and everything but he still loves her and he is not ashamed of her height.|`|XgSO3t8paa	i will admit i do find short girls kinda cute i do like asians. but i do see many tall girls who i find attractive as they tend to look more like models. and i have reasons to like those girls too but where i live tall girls seem more rare and i dont know as many. plus to me if they are attractive they seem a bit intimidating but i still go after them. if they are exactly my height then by far yes too. but if a girl is tall i like them a lot too. especially if i can play basketball with them as if they like basketball. wow that huge plus with them that attract me.|`|eqPFKpVqaa	I don't know because im not a guy.. but i think<br>  most guys prefer a girl shorter than them. :)<br>   <br>  <br>  But that doesn't mean you can't be tall, cuz<br>  they guy could be pretty tall too. :DDD|`|wEFiPb6waa	yes ui do very much!!!! even if it takes to have to get a ladder to F**ck her ohm  seriously!|`|rY5hhcVMaa	if a guys girlfriend is taller than him, it would make him feel less masculine, sorry|`|jlKX6XfRaa	I LOVE tall girls|`|DEHqdmVnaa	if there hot then the answer is simply yes|`|Zqby1cXpaa	as long as they arent taller then the guy oo an were flats lol|`|rAEIG2jbaa	yes
8YfYh3y0aa	Right.... the best thing you can do is to be honest and direct.  Invite Lily and tell her that the invitation is just for her.  If Lucas complains, just tell him kindly, but directly, that you wanted to have a "girls day" with Lily.  Don't make excuses, and don't feel that you need to explain yourself to him.   If he gets mad, tell him that you are very sorry he feels that way, but that you are not going to change your mind because of adult tantrums.   <br>  <br>  Invite him and Alyssa over some evening and ask them to stop and pick up some drinks or pizza on their way.  Once you stop allowing people to manipulate you, you may find that you can actually enjoy being around them.
JtEBaOdjaa	If he's just going for a couple months let him go and you stay here (not breaking up, just living separately).  If he wants it to be longer.then you guys need to have a HUGE talk about it.  Remember, even for a few months you need visa's and they are REALLY hard to get.  He won't if he's a citizen there.  For you, it's a GIANT pain in the butt.  You most likely need to have a job BEFORE you get your visa, this place needs to sponsor you for a visa etc etc. It's a HUGE rigmarole that takes up to 2 years to go through.<br>  On the other hand, this is something I, personally, would JUMP on.  The opportunity to immerse myself in a new culture for a few months, to see a different part of the world...I would jump through hoops to do that.|`|7UVJe31Taa	I'd move in a heartbeat. I would follow my husband where-ever he needed to go. Nothing else matters, you'll move back eventually and get another job. Honestly i don't see a problem just a sacrafice|`|pub2GLZPaa	In a relationship, there should be no bombshells or ultimatums.<br>  <br>  He should not have made this decision without you (if he has told you already that he is indeed definitely going). If he has, then I think you need to rethink the whole relationship and what it means to him vs what it means to you.<br>  <br>  If he is merely wanting your thoughts on this, then decide what's more important- your job here or your relationship. Are you willing to do long distance? For how long? Are you willing to give up your position? and for how long? How flexible is your work with you returning there?|`|vnJG8UYJaa	This is one of those tough situations you will have to work through in order to continue this relationship.<br>  <br>  What are your options?<br>  1.  Break up.<br>  2.  He is only going for a couple of months.  Encourage him to go, but put a limit on the time he is expected to return.<br>  3.  Take a leave of absence from your job and go with him for 3 months.<br>  4.  Both of you move to SA.<br>  <br>  You are going to have to sit down together and figure out what your short term and long term goals are.  Then you are going to have to decide how important each of those goals are and which ones are the most important.<br>  Decide what you need to do to start reaching your goals.<br>  Don't be afraid to discuss your feelings about what needs to be done.<br>  Be mature enough to handle whatever decisions you make together.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|CQsD09D6aa	He should understand that as much as you love him your career is important to you, too. Explain to him that you do not want to lose your job which is in a major salon but that you will wait for him until his return. A couple of months is not a long time. Maybe you would be able to take a short break from the salon and visit him in SA as a vacation. Just a suggestion. If he does not respect your career then maybe you should rethink the relationship.|`|PyiCwi8vaa	Well, if I were you, I'd move to South Africa and keep in close contact with your friends.  And if things don't work out for you there, you can always move back|`|PK5Elowdaa	tell him don't forget to write.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	Let him know that you don't want to go.<br>  <br>  However, perhaps you can compromise . . .<br>  It's just for a few months, right?  Will your salon let you go for just a few months?  <br>  If you are at all willing and it is ok with your salon, you could tell him you will go for exactly X months, but after that you both HAVE to come back.<br>  <br>  Also, try to figure out exactly why he needs to be there.  Is it really important or will it just make things easier for his friend?|`|vx9KtFqjaa	Go to South Africa, but be prepared to leave at the first sign of trouble unless you enjoy being raped, mutilated, and murdered. If there is a food crisis (likely to happen) the primal savages will blame whitey and your going to be dinner for a savage spear chucker.<br>  <br>  I don't care if its racist or not, it is the reality and your life depends on it.

eVK2zZsOaa	I think you need to let your husband decide, this is his mother and there seems to be a strained relationship. It is normal to want the grandparent involved but he has to involve her when he is ready. You don't want the child to get attached to this woman and she disappear again. This type of situation takes time. Just let him do this on his own, support him as his wife but let this be his decision on his own. He needs to give her a meeting when he is ready and he should not involve the children until he betters his relationship with her first.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	stay away from this disapearing nut job.
vbSotVjVaa	Well I hope you realize that if you cut your father off, it won't do anything but hurt you in the long run. I actually had that same issue with my dad and for years I didnt speak to him because I felt like he destroyed our family, it wasnt until I was about 17 that I realized that all of my issues that I was having as far as men and boyfriends was because I didnt have a father teaching me and showing me the ropes, and educating me on these things. Moms can only say so much about that, so finally I talked to him now that I am 19 me and my dad dont have th greatest relationship but I do keep him in my life because it is very beneficial for me. I am a Christian so I do believe it when the Bible said to honor your mother and your father, and I try to do that even though it was his fault just like it is your father's fault. I think your relationship with him will get better if he could admit that he is in the wrong and stop blaming your mother for his actions. That would really piss me off, but dont completely ex him out tell him how you feel about him first tell him what is going on and try and fix it first before leaving him alone.|`|v1tHjJ3haa	tha tis really hard, I am really sorry for you, your mom, and your siblings :(<br>   My dad cheated on my mom like a year into the marriage with his secretary for 16 years ! I just turned 17 on Valentines, my dad secret was put to an end last year around Nov. They didn't divorce, they are tying to work things out. My dad blamed my mom at 1st, but we he was backed in a corner he took responsability.<br>    Just let your dad know how you feel, in the end he live with what he did, and he'll have the weight in his shoulder, tell him cause you need to get it out. I hope everything turns out fine :D<br>  once again.....sorry

The only ONLY only two reasons I'd say its ok to not invite her over for your son's birthday is if your son doesn't want to do anything but hang out with friends, or if your husband doesn't want her around.  <br>  Either way, it's not your call.<br>  <br>  more power to ya!!!!|`|TJezsCkHaa	Yes.He is your son and its his birthday,your son will think that you don't care about him.As of her,have a bigger brain and opened mind and walk away when she says anything that bothers you or draw a fat red line between you and her that she knows that she is not suppose to cross no matter what(but in a respectful way so you won't problems with your hubby).

CT5uCPmFaa	I definitely don't think you should get a new girl just to make her jealous. That's not fair to the other girl. But I do think you should try and move on because she doesn't seem interested. Maybe she just likes flirting with you and doesn't want to be anything more than a friend. That's what it looks like to me. I have a few friends I like to flirt with but I never want it to go any farther than just that. Good luck and I wish I could be more help, but I think this girl has given you enough signals that it's time for you to move on. Good luck :]|`|2Qb62h0zaa	oh no sorry but she doesnt feel that way she wants u as a frnd but she doesnt like u|`|YDUmNLFVaa	That's a toughy. But, it sounds like maybe she does just need more time, and isn't ready for a serious realtionship. Maybe just wants to be flirty friends kind of thing. But I woulndn't ask again until you feel it's right. Don't try to go the jealousy route though, doesn't work. Maybe you should keep her in mind, but find some other people too. I mean she still seems interested in you somewhat. So it's not like she's just forgetting about you. And you could "prove" it by maybe doing little things here and there. Just keep in touch with her, and stay in contact. It'll all work out in the end. Don't get too hung up though unless something does happen. Just try to talk to her more, not so much on the "does she like me" level, but more of the get to know eachother level. And then maybe she'll realize she likes you more than she thought. So just don't worry about it TOO much, only a little lol. But good luck to you! Hope this helped!|`|DEHqdmVnaa	I think you should.....hold on!|`|5n13XFuhaa	problem is, you dont want to freak her out or ruin your friendship by keep asking her out. Maybe she is just playing you along a little bit- and probably loves the attention so wants to keep it that way. Is it impossible for you two to JUST be friends? If it is then its a good idea about looking for another girl, see how she reacts if she reacts badly  then she does like you, however you dont realy want to use someone incase you hurt them. If it is possible for you to just be friends, just enjoy it and you never know what the future holds.|`|8QO17Xw1aa	first thing, do not try to make her jealous. this will only make her mad at you and it never works. its also very immature<br>  ok so it sounds like you got rejected each time cus you were focusing on how she feels without really expressing how you feel, so i agree that you need to do something to show her how much you like her. <br>  you could bring her flowers, set up a picnic, write a letter... its up to you. make sure she knows exactly how you feel and that you are serious about being in a relationship with her. how can she resist? =]|`|kTw5x4O5aa	well thisis what i think...<br>  since i am a girl myself i can kinda relate. <br>  well i think she likes you but she might not want to be tied down.<br>  By her asking u to come along places and to hang out and letting u hold her hand she wants u but not right now. <br>  She might feel more secure if u show her how u feel.<br>  Maybe dont ask her too many times again until u know for sure that she likes u back the exact same way. Just give her time and if this time shows that shes not interested then let her go cuz she might just be leading u on. <br>  but from what u wrote i think she does like u...becuz if i was her and i didnt like u then i wouldnt even bother asking u to come over,<br>  or if shes a big tease and she is pretty hott and knows it then she might just like the attention. It really all depends on the girl.<br>  though i hope i helped u out alittle bit :]<br>  good luck with it.|`|b46d397e033a3773de725a30dee4ee6faa	I am sorry this girl has been treating you like dirt.<br>  <br>  Even if she is into you, it sounds like she's not ready to be dating anyone exclusively. Move on.<br>  <br>  P.S. the whole "jealousy" thing never works. never ever.|`|LIpNXtIdaa	Im a girl and i think that you should think maybe she does like you in that way she is just not ready to telll you that give her sometime and then one day maybe it will work out, but think of it this way she is better then a friend then nothing and those little moments when you hold hands and things could mean something...
v1yefcFjaa	i know how that feels. do you think you might be able to make different friends? it might be the best way. if you made at least one different friend and started being really close to her/him that might be the only motivation you need to want to go to school. i don't really know im just taking a stab in the dark.
28WJwHf4aa	We skipped the bridal party dance altogether.<br>  <br>  I have been to a few weddings where the bridal party stands in a line, and then each person goes out and does a dance by themselves, such as the lawnmower, worm, etc. Something to get the crowd laughing.|`|KTNqah9eaa	If there are not too many of you, I suppose you could try taking a trip somewhere by bus or boat and having a picnic if it's not too cold where you are at the moment|`|QdCwBSVQaa	Yes.  Skip it.  It's boring for the guests to watch.  Do your first dance, then dance with your parents, then open it up to your guests.  Your guests will appreciate it.  <br>  <br>  If either of you have an interesting ethnic heritage, it would be cool to have ethnic performers.  I went to a Sri Lankan wedding where they had Sri Lankan dancers, and I've been to Hawaiian weddings where they had Polynesian dancers.|`|aipChC3haa	I think I get what you are saying, you mean a surprise song or something to make it a little bit more special?<br>  Here's a great idea for you: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlFTIe9ZwVQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlFTIe9Zw...</a>|`|l0jixLszaa	It doesn't have to be a party dance.

Instead of having the awkward moment of having the bridal party dance together.
ql4EgAL3aa	He probably likes you alot! That movie thing was definally a date since he paid. He is probably very shy and he really cares about you especially when he met your mom. When guys like you they care about what you think about them. I think you should flirt with him and get him alone and tell him how you feel about him. This is definally a potential relationship, you both gotta talk about this! <br>  <br>  I feel very happy for you =)|`|BleCAqPuaa	I think you are on the right track. I am almost certain you won’t “scare him” you sound like you both have the same feelings. If you want to take it to the next step you need to do in a way that won’t leave anyone feeling awkward. I have used this (one time and we have been together 10 years I might add) and have advised others to do the same thing in this situation and I have never heard a negative response. Just say “do you have a girlfriend?” he says “no” you say “would you like one?” smile and I think the rest will take care of itself. Just try it!!!|`|TOPTB10Baa	Tell him that you're scared of getting hurt and you know he's really shy, but you like him and you want to know if you guys have a chance at a possible relationship. Say that if you don't that's fine, but that you just want to know so you don't have to wonder about it all the time. Sweeten it up, tell him why you like him and that you want a relationship to come out of it if he feels the same.<br>  It sounds like he likes you from what you said. :]|`|hHes4d7uaa	Just be honest, don't try to use tactics to get the answer you want.<br>  Honestly, if I were you, I'd leave it alone. Keep going on "dates," talking, and having fun together and see where it goes. Let him take the lead in moving it forward.<br>  Keep in mind, this advice is coming from someone with zero dating experience...<br>  Do what seems right to you.|`|DdYUVXBSaa	just be yourself and say, do u want to be my boyfriend because i like you and you are a total gentlemen? does that help you at all?|`|rAEIG2jbaa	go ahead and pluck up the courage and ask him out!!! YOU CAN DO IT|`|nBKSMnTSaa	When you're in a relationship, there should be no hesitating on telling each other what they think or asking each other what they want to know.

(:|`|gYTtiHGzaa	just let it come naturally, there is no ONE WAY of doing it, you just have to grasp the courage to ask him.  and don't be afraid of being hurt, if anything i think this guy MIGHT worship you, lol.

UpRdvpmXaa	The biggest reason might be that you don't want your guy friends to try anything with your girlfriend. Bragging about how great your girlfriend is makes them think about how great they are and give them ideas...which...would just piss you off. :)|`|77NzfiVkaa	My guy doesn't talk about me unless it relates to the conversation. I mean, he's not gonna be like "Hey guess what my girlfriend is awesome!" for no reason. And only two people besides us know that he wants to propose to me (his best friend and one of his sisters). Guys just don't blab everything to their friends like girls do.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	and some guys tell their friends every little detail about a girl, and then they just stare at her and make her feel uncomfortable like they can see her without her clothes on. Blah! I hope your guy respects you.|`|AA12384954	Some guys think it is Kool not to mention them.  If they are too complimentary they run the risk of their friends trying to muscle in on them; they may be worried about losing their gf's to the friends.  On another angle, they may be being respectful and being very careful what they say.  Then again, you wouldn't really know what they are saying when you're not around, and maybe that isn't altogether true either.<br>  <br>  As you may be aware, there are some girls that are attracted to guys that are already taken, so be careful in some respects of who you discuss yours with.|`|AA11043457	Some guys talk too much to their buddies about their girls.  Others do other things and the girls may not be uppermost in their minds or they consider it separate.  They talk to the guys about sports or school.  I'd just as soon my husband didn't talk about me too much to his friends. I'd be more concerned that it might not be totally accurate.<br>  <br>  Evidently those guys who don't know you got back together either aren't that close to him or he hasn't said anything to them.  Why?  It could be that they aren't interested in talking about girls together and it is possible that girls like guys more than guys like girls, or not as important ot  them as other things.  Believe me, even married, they look at work as more important many times than the wife.  <br>  <br>  Sorry about that, but that is how I see it and I don't always like it either way. I guess it depends on what they tell the guys and how close they are to them.<br>  <br>  Girls are more into relationships than guys and do tell their friends much more than guys do.  Guys when they talk about girls sometimes do more bragging.  It does vary guy to guy though.<br>  <br>  If you continue to hang together, the others will get the idea.|`|wYrS24e2aa	huh you say he talks to his buddies then you say he doesnt talk to the guys he hangs out with. How many different guys does he hang out with. Anyway some guys are just not close with other guys or think that its gay if they do. Me personally I can talk to my best friend over anyshit, were just tight like that I dunno like a brother.|`|3FoU68xuaa	I've noticed that too and i always found myself wishing he'd tell the whole world about us, just like i would! hehe. I think it's mostly because guys are perceived as "weak" or "whipped" if they talk about love stuff. So I think they try to downpllay it or at least keep it to a minimum..guys are "not supposed to" apparently  :)|`|MHazHRGRaa	incase they want to bang them|`|aYyRhxA4aa	i guess he doesn't wanna brag about it! =)<br>  thats my opinion...|`|HZgjUguWaa	I agree with  Si|`|REoNMbanaa	guys sometimes dont like to talk to their buddies about their girlfriend because they dont want to seem too attached, and they dont want to get ratted on by their friends for it. when theyre with their friends, they like to focus on them, and when theyre with their girlfriend, they focus on her. usually the two dont mix together. if your guy does talk to his friends about you, he'll keep it simple by saying "oh she's hot'' or "shes pretty cool" or something. <br>  -Em :D|`|ujqIU62Yaa	Every guy sees his gf as the best and no other could top her. We don't like hearing about our friends' gfs so we refrain from talking about our own unless questioned or having problems.|`|IM7nzdjbaa	Well I wouldn't even bother telling all my guy friends about my girlfriend because they wouldn't understand exactly HOW AMAZING SHE REALLY IS. :)|`|5r48jn7iaa	they do talk to them, just about like sex and ****, they dont wanna be like oh yeah man im so in love with her or something cause then the guy will be made fun of.|`|XasLRQnXaa	because he doesn't feel that he needs to tell everyone about his business.|`|qmk2mIKpaa	because you belong to him, and only himm|`|mekiWIu3aa	Because guys don't want their friends to have too much info because its just "TMI", IE some don't really tell their friends things unless its imperative. Guys like to chill out and just "shoot the ****" and relax and escape.  Maybe it's not something important to them as buddies, like it would be to girls. Plus sometimes guys are only concerned about their friend's sex lives and everything else is moot about dating. I wouldn't take offense to it if i were you.|`|Fd0vQ6HDaa	The problem could be that he might have talked about you so bad that he feels ashamed to say that he went back to you after all of his complaints.<br>  <br>  Another reason could be that he might feel that some of his friends like you and he might feel some sort of insecurity.<br>  <br>  There could be numerous reasons why based on the circumstances of your relationship.|`|AA10701265	hes probably affraid hes gunna get the told you so or his friends will say things to him bout you that could be good or bad either way he dosent want to be known as pussy whipped n offense but thats how most guys are cuz we grls all no were pretty much incotrol of our men and if he thinks that his friends are gonna crack jokes hes gunnna wanna look like the big tough guy.....|`|Zqby1cXpaa	ok cause most of the time when my friends talk about a girl its like "dam i wanna bang that" or something humiliating and sexual about the girl an no guy wants other guys to talk about their girl like that|`|I7OqMnkfaa	WOW i have that same question!! you can always talk to his friends about you two :) thats what i did, they apprecitate it acctually haha (the friends)|`|8s2HEgWUaa	Guys don't talk to there guy friends about girls because we don't care what they think.

eVK2zZsOaa	Report him to somebody before somebody gets hurt. Maybe he is using some type of drug and it is making him aggressive.  He shouldn't be playing like that with a female, something is definitely wrong with this guy. Either talk to your parents or go to a school official immediately.|`|sSetS5CHaa	Um, sounds like he has ADHD. He should be medicated.<br>  <br>  Violent jerks are the worst kind, back off until he gets the message and cuts the crap.|`|WJHriZWjaa	He's probably been brought up in an environment where he is taught that it's okay to get physical like that with people. Maybe you should tell your own parents, the principal, a school councilor, anyone that will listen. If you let it go on, he will seriously hurt someone since his abuse only seems to get worse as time goes on. You should distance yourself from him, and tell him that you don't want to be around him until he stops hurting people. If he's not willing to give up his ways for you, then he doesn't deserve you anyway.|`|EIzaLRQwaa	just tell the princible and tell him hes a imature pathetic loser and keep ur friends by u if he keeps doing it just say ur friendship is over untill he grows up|`|lyMMjVNgaa	lick his feet he will get nervous|`|t0VQGp0Jaa	tell her bend down and get on this ******* slimy dick
TJiGs8S4aa	You just need to realize that we all want what we want, when we want it.  They are being selfish, and do not realize that since they are your parents, they already had their chance to do things their way.  Now it is your chance.  You have a couple of choices:  1) you can just "yes" your parents, and agree with them, and avoid arguing, but just go ahead and do things your way, or 2) you can tell them that they are entitled to their beliefs, and you respect them, but you do not agree, and because it is your family, you are in charge and it is your decision.  Then you just ignore their words like rain on the roof.|`|tQIGlYREaa	Tell your parents to take a hike. When you want their opinion, you'll ask for it. That's pretty much what I did with my mother-in-law. "You do things your way, and we'll do it OURS." She used to be a pain in the ***, too, but now she leaves her "advice" to herself, unless we ask her. Things are now so much better between us. I don't wanna smash her nearly as much as I used to! :D|`|ddP3klT3aa	Stop telling your parents every thing you are doing. It is not their business. If your wife goes to a doctor, why tell your parents? Seems like you have a problem letting go.

AA10740296	Just walk up to her and ask her for the first time.  Just say "hey, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go get dinner after work or something?"  If she smiles, ur golden.  Then a couple dates later, have some flowers delivered to her at work.  She'd love it.  Trust me, I did that to my girlfriend.  My advice:  Wait with the "cute" stuff until you're going out with her.  Then after dinner the first date.... if you wanted "cute", take her to a beach at sunset, and sit in the lifeguard towers and watch the sunset and then wait for the stars and lay on the beach.  I did that last night, and it was great.  But for a first date, don't make it like you planned it, just ask her straight out.  Hope I helped man.

Il induit comme son nom l'indique un glissement des maisons par rapport au calendrier Grégorien. Moralité d'une année à l'autre les signes n'ont plus leur raison d'être si ce glissement n'a pas été pris en compte par l'astrologue. Par ailleurs il y a normalement 13 maisons dans le zodiaque. Le 13ème étant le serpenter... <br>  Sans compter que normalement les maisons n'ont pas la même durée. Les astrologues découpent le calendrier en 12 signes d'a peu près 20 jours en moyenne. Or il en est rien la terre traverse les constellations du zodique de fa?on différente suivant les signes. Ainsi le signe du sagittaire ne peut avoir la même durée que le verseau ou le lion...

Maybe in your mind you have dreamt about having sex with a doctor/nurse, or just a woman! We cannot control our sub concious. But no a girl is not a lesbian because of that. In order to be a lesbian, you must only love the female type, and bisexual means you like men and wmen, and heterosexual means you only like the opposite sex.  What im trying to say is that you might need to learn a bit more about yourself, maybe as bad as this sounds, experiment,  (are you attracted to your friends?) and just do some self experimenting, go on the internet, see if your intrested in lesbians look at some pornography, if your body does not like it, or rejects it that means you feel that you are straight, but if your body admires it, maybe its something you need to check out.

AA11073004	Well, do you like him or not? Ask him if he likes you!
fbe7b44959586a403cc7307cf6ba7b2aaa	Well I do not think you are obligated to let her see her cat. Its your cat now. So if you don't want to, then don't. And kudos for not letting your emotions rule your life. Just because her parents are jerks, doesn't mean the relationship would not have worked, but it doesn't sound like it would have worked with HER because it sounds like she is alot like her parents. If she was a real woman she would tell her parents to take a flying leap. If you find someone good, then their economic background shouldn't be important, and in my opinion, you are more deserving of the respect anyway. You actually WORK for a living, she is living off mommy and daddy and probably will never be the kind of girl who would have her man's back over her parents, so better that you realize all this now. Good for you! And I hope you find someone next time who appreciates the right things in a man and not just how big his family's bank account is.|`|04a62fe5acb7e477f5f296636dd8a8b5aa	I don't think it's the cat she wants to see.  Go with having a friend there when she comes and you be scarce.|`|3f1e5da08b5e4da8b9999452a7535de9aa	Take a chance and let her see the cat.  Maybe she wants more, and you could be missing out on true love.  Isn't it her decision whether or not she wants to be with a poor bus-boy and truly in love?  Why did you make that decision for her?  Take a leap of faith...|`|AA11778918	I would ler her come over and just see what will happen becouse if you rember in the end of the note book they are married and have kids and grand kids and i have been there i still have feelings for my ex and we still see each other and we have fallen in love again but we both have  new relationship and we whant out but we are in them to deep and i thank tha yall should try it again becouse i am not rich but he was and we were fine .i thank love is more important in life then what a mother said becouse they dont always get what they want.|`|70cf01f4f693ce272b8cc3876e4f3a68aa	Let her come over. See what she has to say. The whole cat thing is extremely corny. She wants to see you.|`|7661d04c735205388204b0a74310e428aa	I personally think that you should tell her to stay away. You guys are finished and that's that. She gave you that cat and she just needs to move on. Her parents on the other hand are jerks. Just because you don't have money doesn't mean that you can't make their daughter happy. Money isn't everything.|`|7d5dcbf700fcc38fc24e3f7ddbcd9b89aa	I think you shouldn't see her because she really doesn't care from what I read and if she did she would have stood up for you and that not the reason she wants to come over she wants to see you and does not know how to say it so if you don't want to see her then don't see her its the best if you don't so you don't get hurt ya know im going through that rite now myself and its better to stay away|`|9079424d35d001ebc8c059db3bf6d2b6aa	hold the cat ransom<br>  dont get pissed cuz you dont have money.  Money isnt everything-its looks  na just kidding but its not really!|`|c24d903bf1b3d4e01ad3db4d034f91e7aa	You should let her see the cat but maybe you can arrange for a friend to be at your house when she comes, that way you don't have to deal with her and she can see the cat. Or you can drop it off somewhere and then pick up the cat later|`|8e55e2b8857caa7b13d0c6de7ffa6e73aa	no, if she wants to continue to see the cat, then she should give it to friends that she can visit. sounds to me like maybe its you she really wants to see. but until she grows up enough to put her parents straight and make her own choices--i wouldnt touch her with a 10 foot pole. tell her if she wants to see the cat, she'll have to take it out of your place and put it with some people who her parents approve of her associating with. you're really much better off without this kind of snobbery in your life. good riddance to the whole damn lot of them....including the cat!|`|AA10407423	I think you should tell her you just don't want to see her. And if she cared about the poor cat to begin with, she could have taken it with her and gotten her own place instead of running home to mommy and daddy.

The thing behind this one is to show that u have potential that everyone is ignoring.<br>  <br>  Compare ur situation with the accuser or a third party u both know:<br>  U only do this when ur outcome beat them. Then u basically showed them the finger while maintaining ur composure (or at least ur honor) and then they can't talk.<br>  <br>  (If all that fails and u got a family full of Chris Rocks and Bernie Mac) Agree and said u got all the left over genes and that is was all their faults for screwing u over.|`|bac0c08d67448ca69e882615d8e3b333aa	"Please don't compare me to her.

AA11826397	when it happened to me i hadnt cheated, hadnt planned on cheating and wasnt already cheating...i was in love and thought that he deserved a second chance...people do make mistakes.  <br>  <br>  *and people kill me talking about the girl must be weak or stupid or whatever to forgive but bottom line is u never know how ur gonna react until ur actually put in that situation...|`|326d87a2fb18c39a47a79888651f55aeaa	No, it just means that she must some how see good in him, even though he is treating her like dirt.  Beware, she probably will not be so forgiving next time.|`|390c698d7c6da0e8bef7b53bd6085aedaa	it means she is silly an should no that she can do better lol,  well it depends on the girl really maybe she is just so in love that she dont wonna except the fact that you done this to her, but if you done this to me, i would go do th same, b 4 i could evea forgive you, you do it once then you do it again lol but really she loves you, dont you think thats what it is, and it dont mean she will keep takeing you back if u keep doing it, one day she will just say, no more i can do better, thats if she isnt already looking 4 better, we all need love, some of us need more then 1 persojn to be loved , you get what im saying lol|`|3f037ba3611f54cbfcf0a2239dba58f1aa	I agree 100% with kismitt21....|`|53e5bfac3c51bd4f8ccacc4a37c392a7aa	It means she is still in love with the idiot, and is willing to give him another chance.|`|AA10375363	no none of the above,,it just means shes stupid for putting up with it|`|acc06e32aa1b61885e803d0885de8de2aa	She may be stupid or just plans on getting her revenge.|`|ffed20a6ea2261b14b1f8565cac7b338aa	pick one.|`|7d3c6b7c30136b637d9f16d16edc1f67aa	No to all. It means she is loving (or naive?) enough to give him another chance, ignoring the first instict to kick the guy in the nuts.<br>  <br>  But chances are, she has forgiven the man for cheating, but will never forget to bring it up again whenever she wants, just to make him feel guilty.|`|AA12088692	it is safe to say the 2 of you really don't belong together.<br>  <br>  cheating is the opposite of "together"<br>  <br>  obviously, neither one of you are committed to the relationship, so why stay in it?|`|cd23759cad39d27796811cb5ff5c6bd2aa	No.Its only love, if you love someone you have to forgive him/her no matter what.|`|ea20852a0c8f58f3bdcf81256f224cbaaa	NO, it just means she's dumb|`|a5f7c2d21e8502a95cf4490e5490f22daa	no, she may be naive|`|a1b618eecf5148f01401e7648a5fe69faa	It means she's in an advanced state of denial.|`|33e8e854a6957682e0732f41e02aff12aa	Yes<br>  yes<br>  and yes|`|949d805815efb059ab5e32ae1cda283eaa	all are possible, although my first thought is that she's weak.|`|AA12271455	No, to all of the above. Some women are very loyal in relationships, as are some men. However, I would forgive him, but I would not stay. Once the trust is gone, so am I.<br>  <br>  Cheating is a losing game for all that's involved. It strips individual’s layers of trust, limiting them the ability to give of themselves, completely, in present or future relationships.<br>  <br>  Be blessed.|`|AA12313700	Not at all. It just means she is in love and doesn't want to think he would do it again.
7e982d8a9e5f8e0c2d6191723167ad5caa	There is a technique for doing this. It's been a relatively closely guarded secret in the broadcast industry for quite some time. I graduated from broadcast college over 10 years ago, that's where I learnt it....YES it works. There have even been some who've managed to lower their voice by an entire octave. Now don't laugh because of the name of the exercise...it's called "Ding-dong, king-kong, bing-bong" Here's how it works. You recite those very words slowly and clearly (beginning with your natural speaking voice - DON'T force your voice deeper) and hang on to the "ng" sound at the end of each word. The "ng" sound of the last word "bong" you should sustain as long as you can. As you say each word, deepen your voice with each word. You'll feel the vocal cords in your throat going into overdrive. Now do it again but this time deliberately deepen your voice ONLY A LITTLE, otherwise you won't even be able to complete the exercise. Do this once more for a total of 3 workouts. Now let your voice rest. Overdoing it can actually damage your vocal folds. If you want something bad enough, it's worth the wait and the patience to achieve your goal...remember that!<br>  <br>  Continue this exercise daily (it only takes a couple minutes). After about a week of this exercise you can now try to modify your workout. Tilt your head back and look at the ceiling THEN try the exercise. It WON'T be easy because in that position you are deliberately stretching and straining your vocal chords. But don't give up. I wouldn't suggest more than 2 of these exercises per day because of the strain of it all. But after doing the 2 reps, try just one normal one with your head down, chin almost touching chest. What a difference huh? Soooo much easier. Now you have a better understanding of how this works. Give it a try. It worked for me, and many others. But stick to it if you truly want to accomplish a deeper voice. Make a commitment to this exercise just as a body builder does when he/she's sculpting their physique.|`|a3ed90cc530593469e0e5a90da30d7f7aa	A "gay" voice?  LOL...People in my high school thought I was gay because of my hair and clothing.  In the end, some still think so, but I am not and am married with a super sexy wife.<br>  <br>  Dont worry about anything.  Your time is coming.  Its just a couple of rough years.|`|233856fc7d54b60f733d96cb28cb42e5aa	Im not really sure, but i do know 2 guys that is like that and hates it too|`|8010411d5d4c13f4db5aa0f81a0cdd7eaa	tell them to go @#!$ themselves|`|99371c5a6e44a831bebbcbfa33ea0e66aa	Mabey you are gay.|`|AA11115745	wait for puberty|`|a06d22e7bdfeacc7f082ebbefd1b47baaa	You are 15, wait it out.   A voice doesn't make you gay.  Your mannerisms don't make you gay.  Your clothes (as long as they aren't dresses) don't make you gay.  Wanting to sleep with men makes you gay.

Diese Sehnsucht kann manchmal recht schmerzhaft sein. <br>  <br>  Aber was soll man den tun? - Die Situation ist wie sie ist. Das Sch?ne ist - auch wenn wir darauf keinen Einfluss haben - das sie ab?nderbar ist.  <br>  <br>  Die Frage an sich ist nicht "ob" sondern "wann".<br>  <br>  Ich denke für uns Singles ist dies die h?rteste Zeit des Jahres. <br>  <br>  Da helfen nur gute Freunde und der gute Vorsatz, jeden Tag etwas Sch?nes für sich zu tun. <br>  <br>  Mit den "Jahresringen" wird es leider auch nicht einfacher und durch Situationen, die man einfach nicht mehr haben muss, wird man ganz einfach auch vorsichtiger, denke ich zumindest.<br>  <br>  Wenn jeder Single in jedem Land in dieser "ach, so fr?hlichen Weihnachtszeit" abends eine Kerze ins Fenster stellt, als Symbol für den Gedanken an einen anderen Single - Leute, ihr würdet euch wundern, wie hell es auf einmal wird.<br>  <br>  In diesem Sinne, denkt mal darüber nach und vielleicht werden Kerzen knapp dieses Jahr.|`|8c8631f18c4f6b2b3f5a185642151b27aa	Also ich bin "wieder" Single, aber wenn ich mal sehe, was mich so manch unglückliche "Zweisamkeit" zum teil so zerfressen hat, ist es manchmal auch nicht verkehrt über l?ngere Zeit "allein" zu sein !<br>  <br>  Sicher würde es mir auch besser gehen, mit jemendem in glücklicher Zweisamkeit zu leben !<br>  <br>  Aber jetzt m?chte ich auch erstmal allein sein !|`|91c6b7cf81954eb54ec4b83e758f9a07aa	Es hat ja alles seine Vor- und Nachteile.

Ich selber kann nicht gut alleine sein, obwohl es mir eine Zeit lang ganz gut getan hatte, nach dem meine Ehe gescheitert war. Das ging dann ein halbes Jahr ganz gut. <br>  Es kommt aber darauf an, was man unter allein sein versteht.<br>  Allein sein " Singel " kann einmal bedeuten, das man zwar alleine lebt, sich aber trotzdem sich mit Freunden trifft, ausgeht, halt was unternimmt, oder aber auch das man nicht nur alleine lebt, sondern sich auch von Allem und Jedem zurückzieht und keine Kontakte pflegt. Das letztere ist natürlich sehr schwer und kann zur sozialen Vereinsamung, Depressionen usw. führen, so das diese Menschen regelrecht krank werden. Ich denke das sich das keiner wirklich wünscht, kommt aber leider sehr h?ufig vor. Man h?rt ja immer wieder davon das Menschen total verwahrlost in ihren Wohnungen aufgefunden werden, oder sogar manchmal Wochen lang tot in ihren Wohnungen gelegen haben, weil sie keine Kontakte mehr zur Au?enwelt gehabt haben.

You're afraid you're going to regret the decision, you want your cake and to eat it to. Decisions are tough, but you already made a step to do something different with your life.  Stay there and give it an honest to god try.  If it honestly doesn't work out with you in your heart and mind.  Try try again.|`|820e7393acfb342188c160673b6e4ee7aa	You should choose a job for yourself, and not for your boyfriend.|`|AA10349846	well you need to compare the two thinks that are not mixing together...your carrer or your boyfriend..which one do you love more and really think about that and depending how old you are you should 75% choose your carrer.yes relationships are important but your carrer is how good youll make it in life. Mabey you should ask your boyfriend to move over there if you visit so much. I think that you need to move back to home town and if he really loves you you can work something out<br>  <br>  But you also said that you dont want to hate it again and if you move back nothing is going to change really from before.

If not then move somewhere inbetween the 2 where there are salons.|`|AA10696396	I went through a similar scenario.  I left a high profile job and moved away from family too. At first it was still exciting and new and I didn't seem to mind alot of the things that I had given up. But it is a year later, we are still together and love each other more today than we ever did, but I still have my regrets. Not about my love for him, but about giving up a little of my indendence to achieve what I wanted. I'm not bitter, so that is a good thing.  Just sort out your priorities, if you enjoyed working in a salon, then find a new one to work for... don't let your love for this man supercede all aspects of your life, it will only lead to dispondency down the road for you. Commitment has to be two sided, one person can't do all of the sacrificing and not expect something in return. Have a talk with your man and let him know exactly how you feel... and see where that takes you, most likely he feels guilty for "taking" you away from friend and family etc... and would most likely meet you in the middle on some of your issues.. but if you don't communicate about it, you will never know. Peace.|`|2c84577fa6c946a1ffee410f566e2f67aa	Go back to the Salon. Do what you want to do. Dont make chnages just to be closer to your bf. You will regret it when you get there.

They may not be angels, but htey are the spitting image of their mother and they will do great things.  She wasn't one who was afraid of dying when it came her time, but a person willing to take the journey into the great unknown and there she waits for the rest of us to join her.
iwKSjz8Eaa	Nanda ,eu tb sou  apaixonado pela minha prima de 1°grau, e ela tb .<br>  Bom  o apoio de nossa familia foi total .atualmente somos o casal mais querido de toda familia.<br>  Tambem tinhamos a mesma duvida...em rela??o a Religi?o  e tals.<br>  Pesquisamos muitos principalmente na Biblia e n?o tem nada contra a jun??o de primos de 1° grau.Somente contra irm?os.<br>  A unica preocupa??o é algumas complica??es que possa vir em rela??o a ter filhos.<br>  Mas ,alguns simples exames pode comprovar se é seguro ou n?o vc ter filhos com  a(o) primo(a) desejado.<br>  <br>  Desejo tudo de bom .E que Deus aben?oe a Vcs.!<br>  Abra?os.|`|5a19d0056b3e2f98736bfb388449f931aa	acho que tudo bem.... se a família aceita numa boa, n?o há problema nenhum... mas vcs sabem que o risco de nascer uma crian?a com problemas genéticos é grande, né?<br>  Tirando este fator, n?o vejo nada demais... e desejo boa sorte a ambos!<br>  <br>  <br>  bjs|`|5pfzpiWhaa	N?o acho que seja errado. Muita gente acha errado porque foi educada para achar que sim porque em várias religi?es, entre as quais, a católica, proibiam essas uni?es devido a que mais tarde os descendentes desses casais podiam nascer com defeitos o que eles achavam ser maldi??o de Deus. Hoje em dia, há é que ter cuidado, muito cuidado antes de haver uma gravidez. Há que consultar um médico para fazer o historial clinico da familia para ver se existe alguma doen?a que possa ser transmitida à crian?a. Depois de tratada, se f?r tratável, os primos poderam ter os filhos.<br>  Quando se casa com uma pessoa que n?o é da nossa familia, logo estamos trazendo sangue novo para a nossa e melhor hipotese teram nossos filhos de serem saudáveis, porque se mantendo sempre os mesmos tipos de sangue, nele poderam se arrastar por mais tempo determinadas doen?as familiares.<br>  N?o ligues a essas pessoas que criticam vocês, s?o assim, porque, infelizmente, existe ainda muita ingnorancia. A ciência evoluiu muito e hoje muitos dos medos do passado est?o ultrapassados, só que muita gente ainda n?o o sabe.<br>  O que interessa numa uni?o é haver muito amor; que os dois se amem de verdade. Vive feliz, e deixa falar quem fala, mal ou bem, eles falaram sempre! Sê feliz!|`|9ef96ed8aa7d22970fad365d1b4ea2a1aa	Namorar n?o mas fazer nheconheco, sim... rsrsrs|`|MyguPXdkaa	conforme os geneticistas é complicado, pq devido ocorrer combina??o de genes iguais, pode nascer filhos com doen?as genéticas...|`|U1g6fn6xaa	ah vai dar ouvidos  ao q a porcaria da sociedade diz, se eles n est?o gostando azar o deles, manda eles se meterem na vida deles, q deve ser bem chata pra ficar se intrometendo na sua. case com seu primo e mande eles irem a mer da ahahahahahhhaha|`|d09ab159c11bfa95172d30539a2c7ad0aa	Claro que nao...na minha opiniao.<br>  Se vcs se amam por que nao ficarem juntos? Nao de bola pro que os outros falam...eh pura inveja. Vi uma reportagem na TV que essa historia de filho de primos nascerem com problemas nao tem nada a ver. Mais de 90% deles nascem PERFEITOS...Nada pode impedir o amorde vcs. Vc teria coragem de terminar com essa relacao pelo que os outros falam ou pensam? Ea sua felicidade? Onde está??? <br>  Va fundo!! Bjkas|`|f08c9865462899b77887a71bd0a4329caa	Putz...ainda bem q minha prima linda é de 2° grau...se eu ficasse rico...casava com ela.|`|xz9kyHSoaa	Esse relacionamento entre primos é muito complicado,vai a familia a encher os nossos ovidos dizendo q n?o vai dar certo os amigos enfim, errado é mas oque fazer agente n?o manda  nos nossos cora??es a gente é submisso a ele,o importante é q vocês se amam e se respeitem, o resto resolve-se|`|cZx7IRkBaa	Acho perfeitamente normal. Vocês se amam e o mais importante é a aceita??o dos seus pais. o resto que se dane. Tenho um amigo que sua  irm? dele se casou com um primo e se d?o muito bem. Com rela??o á gravidez, já existe hoje uma vacina que pode prever qualquer caso de anomalia, por isso é importantissimo que consultem o medico para saber quantos filhos vocês poder?o ter e aproveitar a vida.|`|746245fa01b56d52f29059e0b518081faa	é. Todo mundo já sabe disso. <br>  Você poder?o ter filhos doentes de má forma??o genética e v?o chorar pro resto da vida. Ou ent?o n?o ter?o filhos naturais. Somente adotados.<br>  é o pre?o.|`|3ef51330186f522835d3d64d62a553d6aa	Ui, que nojo, primo meu pra mim é mulher...credo, vc tem que saber que geneticamente isso é perigoso, os filhos de vcs podem nascer com sérios problemas...minha vizinha é casada com um primo de 1o grau, ela tem 3 filhos e os 3 s?o deficientes mentais...se cuida...case, mas n?o tenha filhos, é sério!|`|8OkzxkClaa	N?o é errado, desde que você o ame e vice versa. No antigo testamento, encontramos muitos casamentos entre primos...<br>  N?o que isso sirva para nos incentivar... mas vemos que n?o é um "erro", como nos pensamos que é! Abra?os!|`|bdb1fbb0a6c3f2b002837336162fe1efaa	Claro que n?o!!!!!<br>  errado é se casar com alguém que você n?o ama. Se você o ama, você tem todo o dieito de ser feliz ao lado dele.<br>  Se alguém n?o está gostando disso, problema dessa pessoa.<br>  N?o ligue para o que os outros dizem e seja feliz.<br>  <br>  Obs.: meus pais s?o primos de 1o grau e eu nunca vi problema nisso. Além disso, eu e meu irm?o n?o temos nenhum problema de saúde.<br>  <br>  <br>  Abra?os!!!!!|`|f05fbb562d9369015e2eedba106ec10faa	O grande tabu que envolve esse tipo de relacionamento está na heran?a genética. A genética explica que se a família possui alguma doen?a hereditária, o filho poderá carregar o gene e conseqüentemente, manifestar a doen?a. Segundo ela, gesta??es entre consaguíneos têm incidência maior de anomalias, numa margem de 32% entre pais e filhos e de 18% entre primos.<br>  <br>  No entanto, os parentes n?o precisam desanimar quando o assunto s?o os filhos. "Tudo isso pode ser amenizado através de uma gravidez programada", diz a médica. O exame de transluscência nucal, pode ser realizado com 12 semanas de gesta??o, identificando os primeiros problemas de má-forma??o. <br>  <br>  Bjs.

a1f4eb464f72fd455618d1ade316680daa	You sound like an awesome guy.You could definetly do better.I left my boyfriend who had problems going on.That had nothing to do with it.I left cause he said he wasn't sure he loved me.If he had done anything to try to make a change,I would of fell on my knees and thanked God!lol.Hey you tried to make it up to her.She should of been more understanding.She should be happy someone loves her this much.Good luck.|`|1da0d429831a6b2879a70191578caf0aaa	WOW! it seems like you have had a ruff time. but if your Ex cant see that you are a busy man, then i think you can find another woman who can. One that will except you as someone you has responsibilties.|`|463c8a6047e08f43814151f1ad723fe2aa	**** her! what you did was a noble thing you had a job..if she wants a man without a job well then thats her... you care for your mom....the way a guy treats his mom shows alot about how they treat their women...you tried to spend time with her!.....at least you tried ...SHE IS THE ONE THAT SHOULD BE APOLOGIZING!!|`|806c2f99f31fb0ba30e89da643c0e267aa	I don't know your situation very well but from what you've said my suggestion would be to let her go.  If her only reason for leaving you was that you couldn't keep a good balance and you did everything you could to fix that for her she would have taken you back. So from what I see I have to say that she seems to have other motives for leaving you.  <br>  <br>  You seem like a good guy and as difficult as it may seem right now I'm sure you will find someone better suited to you and will see you for the great and caring guy you are.|`|b92692b1f62ddfe298c98323a7bf8587aa	Actually, if I was her, I wouldn't be mad, I mean, work hours and especially taking care of your blind mother! Those are things that seem very important to me, and if she can't understand that you don't have as much time as you want to spend with her, then she doesn't seem very good. Maybe it'll be better to spend some time with her along with you blind mother, some bonding, right?|`|32e87706d642b217ca073e1e14c8bfa9aa	well there are stages to a relationship.. where in the first little while you are in the mushy stage where nothing else matters but that other person and you do not see their flaws.... but then you see the real person.. and your ex sounds like she was definitely not for you. you just need to realize what a great guy you are.. and if she cannot love you for how you are and realize that there are other people in your life that need you too and you were doing your best.. then she is not good for you. you will find that right girl one day and she will understand.. and you Will find time when its right.|`|96d90ba3e339760ea9f78fc8126f909baa	hang in there, the right women will come along who will appreciate all you do for her. you obviously tried and it didn't work which only means she wasn't the one for you. so when you least expect it the right one will show up! GOOD LUCK!!|`|1c1a123b9d50af46f70ecb3b9553d4d9aa	Forgive this mess. Let it go. Find someone else that is not as selfish. There are other women that will fall in love with you. If she dos not want you, then find someone that will.|`|83af04b8399a0d39cd1c337c82afcce5aa	Honestly, I don't think she is the right one for you. You want a woman who will understand that you have things you need to do. You need a woman who will help you do things and support you. I think she got sick of being the lost on your list of things to do. Over time, people change. Your ex has changed. She wants attention, but you're always busy. If you really want to win her back, show that you have time for her. If she gives you a chance, make sure to plan a spectacular date without interruptions.<br>  <br>  Don't forget to follow your heart!|`|bengfhcCaa	Okay matter of perception....   Did you really see her for who she was when you were dating....<br>  by the way women are impressed with guys who have confidence and be themselves not try to change to accommodate what you think she may want......<br>  Love yourself without arrogance and others will be able to love you as well....|`|e60754e2c47d3732e670fc3cfec1373eaa	This girl should be realy lucky to have a guy like you. From my experience the more you do for people the less you are thought of! Some day, this girl will need you, trust me. My 'boyfriend' is treating me badly all because he thinks i will hurt him cause he thinks i'm 'outta his league'. I have forgiven him so many times for messing me about, don't know if i have the energy anymore though. I really love this guy, like you do your girlfriend, and i really wish he could see how much this is hurting me right now! Love conquers all, if she is meant for you then you will both find a way to get over things.

Would you as a male like to be classified as owning certain qualities based on your hair colour or race.  Use your own intelligence and judgement to ascertain a woman/girl's personal strengths and weaknesses.  Maybe you should look to changing your attitude rather than thinking you need to select women from a particular race or country.  I'm assuming that you like to be treated as an individual, please afford the same consideration to females and I think this problem's solution will become clearer to you.|`|fc7117280cedb9017461839769b2c21daa	you really shouldn't go on what your friends tell you because each race has women like that....asian are the stereotypical docile female...well that's if you get one from asia...americanized asian women are not like that...hello by now they have attitude...but there are docile black women. docile latins it's more a matter of personality then it is race...I mean my boyfriend is white, he prefers sistas to oh say asians well lucky him he got me, a black puerto rican...now i'm not docile...far from it but that has nothing to do with my race that is just my personality... however I am sweet and i am appreciative i work as hard as I can with what I have I support him always and i can't wait to have kids.... I learned that...from my mother...not because of my race, but how i was brought up....don't close your eyes to the races because every race has it's bad apples and it's good ones you just have to know what you want be as straight forward about it and move on if you have yet to find it...good luck I wish you the best in that
AA11931544	Oh, I'm sorry. I just went through that a month ago. I spent some time alone and to be honest, moped around, cried, prayed about it, talked about... It helped a lot. Now I go out with my girlfriends every weekend and I like being single again. This may sound cliche, but this too shall pass. I was very sad too, but I don't think you need to jump into another relationship. You should take the time to do what you are passionate about.

d501dac47140a38c0f40dfe01ff56577aa	Falling in love is a very complex emotion but the best way to give you an answer is to say that the reason some guys fall in love with some girls and not others is because just like girls guys have certain needs and desires. When practicing the dating ritual or the courting so to speak that is when you each try to figure out if the other person worthy of your love. If your partner is someone that fills a majority of those needs and desires then human nature tends to tell us that we love that person. Unfortunately often we are so moved by false presentations of each other that the majority of relationships end up in separation or divorce.|`|AA11785363	It's nothing so technical as an explanation or so simple as a one word answer.

W0vkhwQqaa	Creo que simplemente está muy a gusto viviendo en pareja y no quiere "complicarse" la vida con terceros que entren a afectarla. Probablemente sepa todo lo malo de tener hijos y nadie se encargó de contarle el inmenso amor que se siente y lo feliz que te hacen tus hijos. Empezá a contarle experiencias lindas con ni?os, hacelo visitar lugares donde los ni?os le lleguen al corazón. Y sobre todo, tenele paciencia. Ya vas a ver que la necesidad de ser papá llega. El tema es que a ellos les llega más tarde que a nosotras.  No lo presiones, pero sí hacele saber que un bebé vendría a completar la hermosa familia que han empezado. Que nunca sería un reemplazo, que simplemente a vos te gustaría ver que ustedes como pareja van a dejar algo en la vida. Algo que tiene parte de los dos y que nació de su amor. No creo que haya hombre que se resista a la ternura de un ni?o. Sólo que tienen miedo. No hay que pensarlo mucho porque los hijos asustan. Sobre todo porque pensás que es "para toda la vida". No podés zafar de ellos de ningún modo. El día que te embarcás en el tema de la paternidas es PARA SIEMPRE. Y, si bien tiene su parte dura y difícil, es el amor más maravilloso y puro que se puede sentir y es la mejor forma de completar la vida.<br>  Te recomiendo que de a poco vayas mostrandole lo felices que serían con alguien más en la familia. Ya vas a ver que pronto llegará ese ni?o tan deseado. Son re jóvenes todavía. Disfruten mucho de su pareja que en cualquier momento dejarán de ser una pareja para convertirse en una familia. Y, a partir de ahí todo será diferente. Todos serán más felices y se sentirán más llenos :D<br>  éxitos y que se te cumpla tu sue?o de ser mamá. Es lo más maravilloso del mundo.|`|2c931ece8e5fa27f58f9b747e503fc07aa	en estos a?os lo hablaron seriamente ???<br>  si es asi puede ser que el no este preparada a lo mejor no se siente maduro para eso y no tiene que ver con la edad uo puede tener 18 a?os y estar preparado para esa responsabilidad, a lo mejor lo asuta, teme no poder, ayudalo no lo presiones, busca ayuda profesional , si eres creyente, algun parroco, pastor etc.<br>  si se aman se puede solucionar.<br>  pensa que es un paso muy importante, es lo unico que es para toda la vida, la paternidad o maternidad. no importa si tienen dias, meses , a?os siempre vas a hacer su padre.<br>  paciencia y mucho amor.<br>  te deseo de corazon que salga todo muy bien.|`|509dc1b49e563fc4642334b4bea8d8efaa	pues el mismo te lo dijo, no esta preparado economicamente, no nomas se trata de tener al bebe, hay que darle todos los cuidados y la atencion que se merece y eso cuesta dinero|`|AA10757433	Pueden ser muchas cosas... yo creo que debes hablar muy bien con él; pero no lo obligues, porque sería peor para la criatura... tal vez él no desea responsabilidades tan grandes, recuerda que un bebé es mantener, criar, cuidar y amar a un ser humano, no un juguete que guardes cuando ya estés cansada... piénsalo bien y hanla abiertamente con tu esposo|`|aQE6Wzyoaa	Estan muy jovenes, todavia no te martirises difruta cada momento con el; cuando tengas 29 entonces vuelve a cuestionar pero ahorita disfruta al maximo tu matrimonio y a tu esposo que es aun muy joven.<br>  <br>  No vale la pena mortificarte sinceramente disfruta, recuerda que un hombre cuando dice no es no.|`|1efbd059a0955f94312e4c1e450e7323aa	si tu y tu pareja se disfrutan al maximo como dices pues sigue asi no digo que los ni?os no son lindos pero cuando no estamos preparados nos resulta que son muchas presiones en nuestra vida.|`|yhODPo6Maa	Pues tener un hijo si es mucha responsabilidad y cuando esten de acuerdo lo van a tener ,creo que el necesita un poco de tiempo todavia te faltan 3 a#os ,a los 28 le vuleves a preguntar ,suerte ,espero que cambie de opinion tener un hijo es hermoso.|`|327e7f904d93fcc47aa5a4b4a01d9873aa	Hola Any !!!<br>  <br>  Solo él sabe la respuesta, y no es precisamente la que te está dando.

There is no way to stop a broken heart, no special drug, no special words or advice. But you can help ease the pain by a friendly hug, a tender ear and most of all true friendship. Only time will heal the broken heart, but true friendship can help to ease the pain. When I lost my first wife of 14 years to cancer my life ended in more ways then one, and it still hurts. But due to a special friendship, She help me to deal with the lost and in time she gave me back my heart and life.|`|h4xLdy8caa	fix it w/ superglue
AA10717540	well your in the same situation as me, but my friend told me that he probley feels good about it that someone hes doesnt know likes him, he will be intereted enough to talk to you and try to find out in his own way.|`|cde58727159fd5660d7cd2c9f7e1632aaa	anything, nothing, everything, if we dont know, you'll know... what are you talking about that is the worst worded question Ive heard, I hope your in elementary school
5932beb7dc2be3a7999f980fdc37cbd9aa	Well, I really, really, was not planning to answer any more questions today. But when I saw some of the other answers, which totally did not do your question justice, I felt like I should answer this one. <br>  First off, as a guy with five sisters, and many friends who are girls, I know that just because you don't have a boyfriend or lots of guys checking you out doesn't mean that you are fat or ugly. That is a stupid idea. <br>  What is more likely to be true is that you are a more meaningful person. The vast majority of guys who are chasing girls are just doing it for the short-term, and not looking for a meaningful person (been there, done that, guilty as charged). Most of the guys who are actively out there pursuing girls have in their minds some "criteria", but really no way of figuring out how to apply it. So what happens is that they fall for the girls who are ditzes, flirts, and those who have no clue about respecting their bodies when it comes to clothes. <br>  SIDENOTE - some people might tell you that the way to get him to notice you is to stretch the limits with your clothes. Well, if that is THE ONLY REASON that he notices you, he's one of those guys who is not worth anything! I have had a female classmate who came to class wearing a sports bra to get a guy's attention. Seriously, if it takes that...FORGET HIM!!<br>  But I think that you have the right idea...the best way for him to start being attracted to you is by your mind! This is a much more lasting attraction than one that is just physical.<br>  Key steps:<br>  1. Observe. If you are a normal girl, you probably have already done this. You know what his favorite color of clothing is, who his friends are, maybe even some pretty personal stuff. So you have to observe something that will be USEFUL TO START A CONVERSATION WITH.<br>  2.Interest. You must be able to GENUINELY express in whatever you decide to start out talking to him about. I know that myself and many other guys HATE it when some random girl comes up to us and talks about "Oh, that new heart-transplant research, blah,blah..." when it is obvious that she has no interest in the topic, and is just trying to hit on me.<br>  3.DON'T KNOW TOO MUCH. I can hardly stress this enough...if you seem to know too much about a guy's personal life already (from all your observing), you are going to freak him out and make him think that you are a stalker. I personally know that you aren't a stalker, just because you have been watching a guy and have decided that you like him, but a lot of guys don't understand that that is how girls work.<br>  4.Start small. This is important, not just for his sake, but for yours also. If you get way too emotionally involved in the first conversation, you are setting yourself up for problems. Guys LOVE it when a girl can come up to them, start a friendly conversation about something interesting for 5mins, and then say "Have a nice day! See you around!" A guy is MUCH more likely to want to talk to that girl again as opposed to the one who just carries on for half an hour, and drones on and on about "How nice it was to talk to you." Then, after the conversation, do not dwell on it too long. Otherwise, you will start worrying about something you said that maybe you hurt your chances or something. Most guys are not trained investigators, so they have no idea about the details of a conversation 10 minutes later.<br>  5.Confidence. This goes a lot with what I just said. A guy is more likely to remember the attitude you had during a conversation than what you said. If you just allow yourself to be comfortable, and not worried about the conversation, you will come across the right way.<br>  6.Questions. People like it if you ask genuine questions which show an interest without being nosy. Guys, especially, like to show that they are knowledgeable about a subject. If a girl asks a guy a genuine question actually looking for his opinion, his male ego meter will shoot way, way up =). Also, the way he responds to a question will give you a better idea if he is the type of guy you would want to go out with...you don't want one who is toooooo stuck on his own intelligence (though most guys are to some extent).<br>  <br>  If you have those six points down, you really are better off than almost anybody. Five, and you will impress the guy. Four, and you still stand a very good chance.<br>  <br>  But I think you are really looking a little more for answers about WHAT to say. I understand this, because I used to be a slightly shy person too. Since I do not know ANY specifics of what sort of person you are or he is - whether you are high-schoolers or 30somethings, or what sort of context you know him in...work, church, school, or something else - I have a hard time coming up with specific words for you to say when you start the conversation.<br>  I will theorize that you are in high school...let's say he is on the school debate team.<br>  You: Hi, "Boy", how are you today<br>  Boy:Uh, I'm great, thanks<br>  You:Is it true that you're on the debate team?<br>  Boy:Uh, yeah<br>  You:What is your favorite thing about that? <br>  (Open-ended question, now he is forced into a conversation, and the rest is up to you...If he is a halfway decent guy, he will treat your genuine question and you with respect)<br>  <br>  Well, those are really just ideas...it is important that WHATEVER you do or say, you just need to be NATURAL. <br>  <br>  I hope that this helped a little. If he is the right guy for you, may you be successful! =) Hey, you asked for an in-depth answer =)|`|16638058c464a64dc71e2beda9837e8caa	Anna, don't take this in the wrong way, but you probably are FAT & UGLY and that is why guys never notice you. The question you have to ask your self is WHY WOULD ANY GUY WOULD WANT TO BE SEEN WITH A FAT UGLY COW. You really should take the time to improve your self image and then guys would notice you. BUT FOR NOW IT SUCKS TO BE YOU.|`|34499fe224aaaaa92b55508254d95ea1aa	i no your talking about me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...
fGf0SXMzaa	Lady, I strongly advise you to go and interact a little with<br>  other people, without giving up the Nature and the Literature<br>  off course, and by all means keep on dreaming about <br>  millions of adventures.<br>  But to only want friends you can write to is not the way to go,<br>  I'm a bit of a loner myself because I like to spend a lot of time<br>  in quiet solitude, but I will go out and paint the town every now<br>  and again.<br>  What you however seem to be heading for is loneliness.<br>  which is a very sad state, and will damage you in the end.<br>  The World is not dull and boring at all. and even if it seems<br>  to be than certainly not all the people in it are boring.<br>  Go out there and live a little, try to talk to some people you<br>  may think are Interesting, go into the Library and see who else is into reading books.<br>  You may end up being 2 Loners together but you won't be lonely anymore.<br>  And if everything fails, yes you may e-mail me as a pal.<br>  But you may not like me very much at times because pals<br>  do tell each other the truth, and I don't like the direction you<br>  are taking right now !.<br>  Best of Luck, may you have a million adventurous dreams.|`|61fbe97a924b66e641621eac7cb329a2aa	I think you are very right about nature being a joy in this world. I absolutely nature and find it to be absolutely amazing in everyway possible. Although I think this world has alot to offer, its just finding the things you love about it. thats all. I know its hard to find joy in a world full of chaos, which right now seems to be all over the world. If you'd like to write, feel free. jenblankenship@sbcglobal.net and ill respond.

E4TRRSC5aa	He was probably flirting with you. It looks like he has no clue how to flirt with a woman. I hope you gave him a dirty look or ignored him. Maybe that will give him a clue not to do that.|`|7f389541bed45aedccdb509579456cbdaa	he probably thought he was being funny....maybe he even thought it would be a good way to get your attention .......instead he came out looking like an obnoxious moron. i cant stand guys like that =/|`|AA11646124	I would guess that he thought he was being cute, funny, and flirty.  Instead, you thought he was a jackass?  No matter how cute a guy may be, there are times when I just want to work out, or shop at a mall, or hang out with my girlfriends at a bar.  Some guys can understand this, others act like a small child and do everything they can possibly think of to get your attention.|`|HtQ6ouYHaa	You might just look stupid when you run...check in the mirror or he was just being an idiot or you were being paranoid and he wasn't mocking you or he might have had tourrettes.|`|9b59e35cf3229fb26295263da4396263aa	Nope, you weren't doing anything wrong.

1157259d7d79143d1b3e1134cf49d0a3aa	So if a girl is not thin and pretty, she's not worthy of a boyfriend?

If that's the case, than my answer is no. No one should have to change themself for you, and you need to ask yourself if you truly want to date this      for everything she is, not just so she could lose weight to fit your potential. This question sounds pretty shallow to me.|`|10c528093b0f85805e7641518461de95aa	is she pretty in face or in mind?, you should do what your heart tells you not what other parts of your bady do. slim pretty girls are mostly self obsessed with them selves to worrie about there partners larger girls don't have that problem. so my answer is don't be so shallow.|`|212190ed11568bf18ce98f3f5ebfd9a6aa	girl, big girls are THE ****!!!! I know because I am one, honey. and I know Im fine too.  and we are the same size, too. perfect.  Hell, i get more attention than ANY of these thin mints running around here.  If youre pretty, youre pretty.  It doesnt matter what size you are, as long as you are healthy and happy.  And there are PLENTY of fine men out there who know that big girls are THE ****.  so dont put pressure on yourself to change just for a man, girl, because he should like you for YOU.  the only reason you should ever want to change is because YOU want to change.  But Big Girls ROCK!|`|5205310ccfc9b5323daf5f2cfe5571bcaa	Size isnt as important as long as you are healthy and we have chemistry together.

Think about it. why cant people accept us how we are."<br>  <br>  because she used to be thin therefore she is not made this way.. she put herself into this way with laziness or gluttony (sorry to be so harsh)  this doesnt make you a bad person, but it is what it is

HEgMOyYMaa	Adam, bela escolha, adoro esta música!...<br>  Trata-se de uma pessoa que se tornou rebelde por falta de op??o, porque as pessoas nunca o trataram com amor, sempre se voltaram contra ela, ou seja, ela nunca teve oportunidades de ser uma pessoa realizada, daí seu desejo de ser diferente, "como uma crian?a cheia de esperan?a e feliz", porque na vida tudo o que sempre teve foi desprezo. Muitas pessoas s?o assim, se revoltam contra o mundo porque n?o tiveram carinho. Bandidos, marginais, traficantes, assassinos, etc, etc, etc. N?o sou ninguém para julgar essas pessoas, porém penso que este n?o é o melhor caminho. Diante de uma dificuldade a pessoa tem que procurar dar a volta por cima e mostrar para os outros que tem valor. Mas isso nem sempre é possível, porque existe tanta gente que nunca foi amado, que n?o sabe nem sequer o que é amar, ter fé, ter auto estima. Daí eu falar que n?o sou ninguém para julgar essas pessoas.|`|bdb1fbb0a6c3f2b002837336162fe1efaa	Esse trecho diz que o "personagem" da música foi for?ado por alguns acontecimentos de sua vida a ser rebelde, mas que, no fundo, ele gostaria de n?o ter passado por essas situa??es e ser alegre e feliz.<br>  <br>  <br>  Abra?os!!!|`|Vm7aTTsGaa	As pessoas s?o rebeldes porque querem, a vida n?o influencia em nada.|`|0f921a833956e1f32237784a639fde02aa	boa veio|`|ELTXZel1aa	porque essa crian?a n?o existe mais, agora amadureceu e ficou na rebeldia!!!<br>  essa crian?a queria ter uma infancia feliz mas n?o aconteceu!!!|`|P1Wa6HiRaa	Está faltando uma parte importante da letra.

7fJVnRZaaa	Thats perfectly normal. Anytime I watch the tv, I get depressed cuz I don't look like Eva longoria. In a relationship he should respect your wishes, or atleast look at it when he's completely alone.<br>  <br>  You have to think of whether your eally want to be treated like that. Be selfish here. Your best bet may be to break up with him. You don't deserve to have your feelings crushed. relationships are about compromise not letting him walk all over your feelings.<br>  <br>  Keep your chin up girl. You deserve better and you're more beautiful then you're giving yourself credit for
1a224f3c589d38a106124e6002598931aa	Yes, it's perfectly normal for that amazing "new" love feeling to wear off over time. The original feelings were caused by chemicals in the body to get you excited and attracted to each other. These chemicals are then replaced by other chemicals that cause you to be more comfortable with each other. Your love then starts to slowly mature and grow deeper as you learn more about each other. <br>  Relax and don't worry. The love is still there. Continue to sometimes do romantic things and remember what brought you together in the first place.|`|28da13b1fede915c51d8053c844dc239aa	um...u should try new and exciting things to do w/ him|`|GQzlF0mTaa	Dont worry, a lot of relationships fade out when you been with your loved one long enough. There are many reason why this happens. One is that two people are always busy, meaning you guys dont have time to see each other often, talk on the phone a lot, and etc. Or maybe you guys havent been doing anything interesting to keep your relationship alive again like before. Or perhaps, you guys have stopped saying "i love you" to each other and now you think that he doesnt care for you anymore. <br>  <br>  Anyway in reality, there is no such thing as a perfect relationship. You have work and compromise with your bf/gf  to maintain a good relationship. Communication is one thing you need to have to keep a strong happy relationship. But what you need to do is discuss this issue with your bf to see how he feels about you.|`|AA11776726	yeah it did once with an old bf...we decided that we didn't have what we thought we did and we broke it off now I have the perfect relationship and I'm happy...I'm not saying that you should dump him by any means just re-avaluate yourself and your relationship. if you still really love each other do something fun on the weekends get a hotel room with a hot tub and have fun!|`|5c3c6d49134ba912d98633a79f71e057aa	it was opposite in my ex relationship<br>  <br>  i felt close to her, but she wasnt as close to me as i was to her... something i dont like (to be closer to the girl than the girl is to you)<br>  <br>  but when the spark died down, we just did little kid stuff, walking, playground, trampoline

c52a45d42afed88f6a35e2e64a19790aaa	arrange dates. meetings. juss talk to him a lot .
AA10100515	according to some psychologist after some one breaks up they find the need to attach themselve to another person.  This might be the feeling you have towards your friend.  But I could be wrong.  But incase I am right and it mainly doing so on a sub consious level.  I say give it time.  It is also a bad idea to rush into another relationship after a break up.  Feelings towards others normally linger on even after the break up.  The mind sometimes have trouble letting go because it has grow use to the feeling.  Also dont let anybody pressure you into sex.  Take your time.  Guys really should learn to wait.  As for you friend the girl.  I am unsure what to say.  Part of me says to talk to her more about it.   And there is another reason you maybe falling for your guy friend.  After knowing and being friends with him for so long you have devoloped a bond with him that will be hard to develop with another person.  Sorry for being all over the place in this answer.  I hope it helps.  Good luck

Just because she can't or doesn't want to date right now doesn't mean you can't be friends with her, does it?

Ninguém diria em s? consciência que n?o deseja ser feliz.<br>  <br>  Todos querem a tal felicidade. Daí porque todos a procuram, nos mais variados lugares e das mais diferentes formas.<br>  <br>  Como já disse nosso querido amigo, Divaldo Pereira Franco: "O grande desafio da criatura humana é a própria criatura humana", ou seja, o nosso grande desfio somos nós mesmos, nosso autoconhecimento.<br>  <br>  Nós, seres humanos, já viajamos pelo espa?o, fomos à lua, descobrimos outros planetas fora do sistema solar. Ainda assim, este homem, guiado pela tecnologia ainda n?o conseguiu encontrar a plenitude, a felicidade, porque n?o teve coragem de realizar a grande viagem interior, tentativa mais eficaz para o autodescobrimento. N?o logrou realizar alguns questionamentos, tais como: quem é? de onde veio? para onde vai? e porque está aqui?<br>  <br>  Cabe ao ser inteligente descobrir na Terra a raz?o fundamental da própria existência, a fim de estabelecer os parametros propiciados da felicidade, de forma a desenvolver a capacidade de crescimento interior, raz?o primordial da sua auto-realiza??o. Enquanto n?o se resolva por detectar e aplicar os métodos mais compatíveis para o enriquecimento moral e espiritual, tudo se lhe apresentará sem sentido ou maior significado transformador, tornando-se o transito carnal um desafio recheado de desencanto e afli??o.<br>  <br>  Podemos alcan?ar a felicidade hoje, agora, a despeito dos problemas que estamos enfrentando. Basta olhar a vida com outros olhos, mudando as lentes pelas quais enxergamos os fatos.<br>  <br>  Sabemos que n?o somos somente aparência material, física. O ser humano é pré-existente ao corpo e a ele sobrevivente. Através desse conceito é que conseguimos entender nosso enigmas, as problemáticas do inter-relacionamento, da dor, do desamor.<br>  <br>  A felicidade tem uma conota??o diferente para cada criatura, de acordo com o nível intelectual de cada um. Se perguntarmos o conceito de felicidade, teríamos respostas variadas, de acordo com as necessidades de cada um.<br>  <br>  Lamentavelmente, n?o sabe-se o que é felicidade por estarmos, nós seres humanos, vinculados ao material. N?o conseguiu-se, ainda, um conceito claro sobre felicidade. Várias escolas filosóficas, vários pensadores, filósofos tentam defini-la.<br>  <br>  Por estarmos a maioria, ligados ao material, muitos condicionam a conquista da felicidade à aquisi??o de bens materiais, outros ancoram o sonho da felicidade na busca da fama, do sucesso, do poder, para outros a felicidade está associada à inexistência de problemas, outros tantos condicionam a felicidade à ocorrência de um fator externo, e a lista prossegue sem fim.<br>  <br>  E nós? Será que estamos condicionando nossa felicidade a algum acontecimento? a algum bem material, a alguma pessoa? Será esse o caminho da felicidade? Certamente, n?o. A felicidade n?o está fora de nós. Ela é, antes de tudo, um estado de espírito, uma maneira de ver a vida e n?o a um determinado acontecimento. Ser feliz é uma atitude comportamental frente a execu??o da tarefa que viemos desempenhar na Terra. <br>  <br>  A verdadeira felicidade consiste em fazer o bem, "n?o é ter ou n?o ter".<br>  <br>  Um dos grandes filósofos da nossa história, afirmou serem três os pré-requisitos para alcan?armos a felicidade: "consciência reta", "vida correta" e "Cora??o de Paz".<br>  <br>  Temos que lembrar que a vida n?o é um problema, é um desafio. Ela nos apresenta oportunidades de crescimento, notadamente nos setores que mais necessitamos. Por detrás dos problemas existem li??es, desafios, tarefas. E grande ventura tomará conta de nós quando vencermos os obstáculos que a vida nos apresenta. O serm?o da Montanha é a pura prova de que somente ser?o bem aventurados aqueles que souberem superar as dificuldades da vida. Se n?o acreditarmos, basta olharmos as pessoas felizes e verificar que todas elas passaram ou passam por grandes provas e expia??es. Lembremo-nos dos primeiros crist?os, que seguiam cantando até a arena onde seriam devorados pelas feras.<br>  <br>  Lembremo-nos da felicidade de Francisco de Assis, conquistada na humildade, na pobreza e no servi?o ao próximo. O santo da humildade era mo?o rico, mas vivia amargurado na riqueza que possuía. só encontrou a paz depois que se entregou à riqueza do espírito. N?o nos esque?amos de que Paulo de Tarso, que na condi??o do poderoso Saulo era infeliz, mas voltou a viver após o célebre encontro com Jesus na Estrada de Damasco. Paulo perdeu o poder temporal, mas encontrou a felicidade pessoal. Gandhi encontrou a sua felicidade na luta pela paz. Madre Tereza e Irm? Dulce, apesar dos inúmeros padecimentos que sofreram, conseguiram encontrar a felicidade na felicidade que podiam proporcionar ao desvalidos do caminho. Albert Schweitzer, médico, laureado com o Prêmio Nobel da Paz em 1952, encontrou a felicidade vivendo 52 anos de sua vida entre os povos primitivos da áfrica.<br>  <br>  Como esquecer a permanente alegria de Chico Xavier? E olhem, que problemas na vida n?o lhe faltaram. Várias vezes perguntaram-no se ele estaria disposto a passar por todas as provas que a vida lhe marcou. E a resposta, já conhecida de todos, é que faria tudo de novo e que pretende no mundo espiritual, continuar a sua tarefa de médium.<br>  <br>  Ent?o, amigos, a alegria de viver deve ser uma norma de conduta natural em todos os seres pensantes, mesmo quando n?o se exteriorizam conforme desejaríamos. Isto porque, as ocorrências do dia-a-dia alteram-se a cada instante, transformando tristezas em júbilos como felicidades em infortúnio.<br>  <br>  Vicente de Carvalho considerou que a felicidade existe, mas é difícil de ser alcan?ada, porque está sempre onde a pomos e nunca a pomos onde estamos.<br>  <br>  As estradas que levam à felicidade fazem parte de um método gradual de crescimento íntimo, cuja prática só pode ser exercitada pausadamente, pois a verdadeira fórmula da felicidade é a realiza??o de um constante trabalho interior.<br>  <br>  Nosso principal objetivo é progredir espiritualmente e, ao mesmo tempo, tomar consciência de que as circunstancias felizes ou infelizes de nossa vida s?o o resultado direto de atitudes distorcidas ou n?o, vivenciadas ao longo do nosso caminho.<br>  <br>  Construímos castelos no ar, sonhamos irrealidades, convertemos em mito a verdade, e por entre ilus?es romanticas, investimos toda a felicidade em relacionamentos cheios de expectativas coloridas, condenando-nos sempre a decep??es cr?nicas.<br>  <br>  Ninguém pode nos fazer felizes ou infelizes, somente nós mesmos é que regemos o nosso destino, somos herdeiros de nossos atos. Assim sendo, fracassos ou sucessos s?o subprodutos de nossas atitudes construtivas ou destrutivas.<br>  <br>  A destina??o do ser humano é ser feliz. o ser psicológico esta fadado a uma realiza??o de plena alegria, mas, por enquanto, a completa satisfa??o é de poucos, ou seja, somente daqueles que já descobriram que n?o é necessário compreender como os outros percebem a vida, mas sim como nós mesmos a percebemos, conscientizando-nos de que cada um de nós tem uma maneira única de ser feliz. Para sentir as primeiras ondas do gosto de viver, basta aceitar que cada ser humano tem um ponto de vista que é válido, conforme sua idade espiritual.<br>  <br>  é sempre fácil demais culparmos um c?njuge, um amigo ou uma situa??o pela insatisfa??o de nossa alma, porque pensamos que, se os outros se comportassem de acordo com os nossos planos e objetivos, tudo seria invariavelmente perfeito. Esquecemos, porém, que o controle absoluto sobre as criaturas n?o nos é vantajoso e nem mesmo possível. A felicidade dispensa rótulos e nosso mundo seria mais repleto de momentos agradáveis se olhássemos as pessoas sem limita??es preconceituosas, se a nossa forma de pensar ocorresse de modo independente e se avaliássemos cada indivíduo como uma pessoa singular e distinta.<br>  <br>  Felicidade n?o é simplesmente a realiza??o de todos os nossos desejos, mas sim, a no??o de que podemos nos satisfazer, com nossas reais possibilidades. A felicidade nós a encontraremos na harmoniza??o, no amor verdadeiro, na renúncia e no desprendimento. Nós a encontraremos ainda, dedicando-nos aos que sofrem, procurando amenizar-lhe as dores.<br>  <br>  Na verdade, sintetizado o que foi falado, a felicidade é a certeza da imortalidade.<br>  <br>  Face a todas essas conjunturas que se fizeram objeto de nossas reflex?es, consideramos que o trabalho interior que produz felicidade n?o é simplesmente meta de uma curta etapa, mas um longo processo que levará muitas existências, através da eternidade, nas muitas moradas na Casa do Pai.<br>  <br>  Por que?<br>  <br>  Neste mundo transitório, tudo passa. Passam a alegria, a tristeza, o júbilo e a dor. Aqui, a felicidade também é rápida; é como a labareda que se mantém acesa enquanto tem combustível, depois se apaga.<br>  <br>  Disse-nos Jesus: "O meu reino n?o é deste mundo", eqüivalendo dizer que a verdadeira felicidade é um estado de permanência e que a verdadeira plenitude será um dia alcan?ada, em alguma das muitas moradas do Pai. A felicidade n?o pode ser algo t?o transitório.<br>  <br>  Allan Kardec, interpretou no Evangelho, que a felicidade n?o é desse mundo. N?o quis, ele, afirmar que aqui é um vale de lágrimas, um inferno, mas sim, que este mundo é uma escola. E como toda escola, existe a disciplina e quem n?o respeita estas disciplinas precisa ser reeducado, no nosso caso, precisa voltar, reencarnar.<br>  <br>  A felicidade n?o é deste mundo, nos diz o Evangelho, mas come?a aqui, ela se realiza nos seus alicerces, para quando viajarmos deste mundo sejamos plenos e felizes.<br>  <br>  Por isso o Espiritismo preconiza a cren?a da imortalidade da alma, comprovada cientificamente em pesquisas realizadas nos laboratórios. O Espiritismo é uma ciência de observa??o, nos dá (mostra) uma filosofia de comportamento; explica de onde viemos, quem somos, para onde vamos e porque estamos aqui, aquelas perguntas iniciais, lembram.<br>  <br>  A nossa felicidade será naturalmente proporcional em rela??o à felicidade, ao bem que fizemos aos outros. Portanto, a caridade essencial é aquela que transforma o indivíduo, que erradica as causas da miséria e n?o aquela que mantém o miserável; mas a que muda a estrutura moral do indivíduo. é a caridade do perd?o, do esquecimento das ofensas. é uma atitude de sublima??o, pois nos diz o Evangelho: "Fora da caridade n?o há salva??o". N?o importa no que cremos, importa o que somos, é claro que o ideal é caminharmos junto aos ensinamentos do Mestre.<br>  <br>  A religi?o Espírita ajuda-nos a sermos corretos, porque nos explica e mostra que somos responsáveis pela nossa vida, nós é quem a escrevemos. Deus n?o nos castiga, n?o nos premia, nós é que construímos através do livre-arbítrio. é aí que entra a felicidade de servir.<br>  <br>  A arte de viver é a arte de servir. Feliz é quem ama, n?o aquele que se faz amado. Felicidade é a arte de exalar alegria, a proposta da felicidade é esta auto-supera??o, da domina??o das nossas más inclina??es.<br>  <br>  Somos filhos de Deus. A felicidade é possível e já, n?o precisamos transferi-la. Quando buscamos e achamos Deus, n?o reclamamo-no mais, podemos dizer a este Pai que amamos a vida, amamos o amor.<br>  <br>  Encaremos a vida com os olhos do bem, com a vis?o do amor e com o concreto desejo de olharmos à nossa volta e verificarmos que o Pai tudo nos legou para que a nossa felicidade se efetive já. Aben?oemos o trabalho em que a vida nos situou; santifiquemos a família terrena do jeito que os familiares s?o; enfrentemos com dinamismo e alegria os obstáculos da vida e assim, amando e servindo, haveremos de encontrar a felicidade que há muito tempo espera por nós.|`|5e785148f2be42fd67ec80beb5fac883aa	Felicidade...........<br>  <br>  muitas vezes achamos que felicidade é só aquilo que me faz feliz, errado, pois vivemos em rela??es e se nesta rela??es alguém n?o está bem vc também n?o estará. por isso felicidade é um sentimento relacionado com alegria,. agora: se vc consegue fazer mais de uma pessoas feliz vc saberá o que a verdadeira felicidade, e entenderá o que quero dizer.<br>  <br>  um beijo seja feliz fazendo outra pessoa feliz.|`|66ff9f984800e498cbff26e81bd0f28caa	Simplemente de: "MOMENTOS, OCASI?ES OU SITUA??ES".|`|707cb64f1bb7d4840d2bf6e55f8a35b2aa	Felicidade é mais que dinheiro no bolso, é ter alguém que vc ama e que t ame do seu lado, é poder ter tempo pra passear e viajar com seu amor, é ter saúde(que vale muito mais que dinheiro, porque com saúde podemos fazer muitas coisas, inclusive ganhar dinheiro), poder trabalhar, criar seus filhos com saúde e seguran?a, ter paz e harmonia no lar e no trabalho, ter amigos...|`|716386e1255234a4424c4dc86dfc3c70aa	eu i meu namo casados morando numa casinha na praia brava sc...com um cachorrinho xamado pudim<br>  hehehe<br>  a felicidade ta nas coisas simples da vida...<br>  e n?o existe felicidade eterna e sim momentos felizes...<br>  ent?o temos que fazer cada momento mto especial|`|7fcf47c93fa2da1fd729084efcf45574aa	Sentimento profundo de seguran?a e paz . por que encontrou sua alma gemea , sua alian?a com o supremo  , e isto te completa e te subre. <br>  <br>  resumindo.<br>    Sentimos  muita felicidade qdo somos amados, e podemos retribuimos esta amor.|`|9d689fdb8d9266d95f23f69cdeb4f078aa	algo que preenche totalmente  o astral da gente, felicidade se resume em saber ir embusca dela subindo degrau por degrau e n?o pela cabe?a dos outros.. ser feliz é se amar em primeiro lugar e buscar fazer os que nos rodeiam felizes tb, trabalhar no que gosta é ser feliz, emfim..........felicidade é se aceitar com as qualidades e defeitos e saber lidar com os dois|`|b261c4603140c15178b79fc049d52a98aa	Felicidade é o mais puro sentimento de uma vitoria alcan?ada.A felicidade verdadeira brota quando vemos que conseguimos deixar feliz à quem amamos,nem que o pre?o seja a nossa renuncia.|`|bdb1fbb0a6c3f2b002837336162fe1efaa	Qualidede de vida (viver bem e com quem você ama).|`|c8bb0bfd7ee141a6e22b7e7d92c86a34aa	uma coisa boa, um praser.

Talk to your dad, tell him how exactly his actions and words hurt you and could cause you emotional damage in the long run.<br>  But I do want to warn you  that sometimes, people can't change.

When opportunity arises, you may want to consider speaking to his girlfriend. It seems that he takes his relationship seriously with her, and he might be more receptive if she had a talk with him. She is probably also in a better position to relate to you and your father, in understanding that it hurts you. <br>  <br>  Your dad probably makes derogatory comments as a joke, ignorant to the fact that they are striking deeper than the surface. <br>  <br>  If you do talk to his girlfriend about this, dont ask her to take sides, just tell her how you feel. She may feel trapped if she thinks that you are going to use her in an argument against your father to prove your point, so use discretion, and let her know that you're willing to listen to what she says. its all about your approach. <br>  <br>  If you can successfully communicate how you feel to her, i'd bet that she would be willing to help you and be effective in doing so - whatever you do, if she does help you out, don't ever use her as a tool against your dad in an argument.<br>  <br>  wish you luck|`|a18f1e7c38155d4eb22651ab9417dcbfaa	I would ignore his arrogant attitude, and if he is ever ready to talk to you in a nice manner then talk to him.

The heart is better than all of us in that it doesn't recognize color.<br>  :)|`|daba7ac849f99394f29244954fed0496aa	I am European and no not always but it is true i like dark brunettes that are tan or mixed. but not because of race because they typically understand more about my culture and the Europeans are way more romantic.I am from France.|`|e3c2bdb552de98fd4668dad5bc63ce3eaa	i honestly don't mind bc i went out wit one and i'm proud of it.  there is nothing wrong wit it.
8b526b80bf92af46fdb8e5cd8d48e206aa	im sorta in the same boat im mixed to and i prefer white guys over black guys because well i grew up in a mostly white neighborhood so thats all im used to and im not use to the so called "game" being spit out me but most of it sounds disrepectful anyway.. all in all just be yourself even if its lame into the eyes of someone else|`|6d3532f53933dc896e58891029303ffbaa	No need to "spit game". Come correct at the right one and what you say to them would not be consider lame as you say.  Why would you want to be someone you're not all the time just to date a black girl.  We are all the same as women black or white and the smart ones can smell game a mile away. "When keepin it real doesn't hurt"|`|d29a44e02c42a8024e92b07710066a38aa	Girls make labels fast if you are the kind of guy that only dates one race and then all of the sudden tries and go for the other team then heck men what game are you plaing and what team are you on?|`|ea20852a0c8f58f3bdcf81256f224cbaaa	We do come off as aggressive sometimes. But not all of us.<br>  Black women respect a strong man. They want someone who's not afraid of putting them in their place. If they see that you can be played, they'll either play you or not give you time of the day.<br>  Hard but all worth it in the end, coz there is no love like the love of a black woman ( ok maybe I'm biased lol)|`|5ec442fcbb14eabc1989fc161f1aafb8aa	Is true, my black fiance says he only dated two black girls in his life. That was only because he always felt he had something to prove.

You have to be confident whenever you approach a girl. Lame to me is someone who's not sure,indecisive, or a push over. Just be yourself and "spit" your style, no matter who you are talking to.|`|f1047fe0a7b0e36c534633a4faf75da2aa	they are more powerful and they have more respect then white girls. i think personally. they are more agressive and they want a guy who isnt afraid to do anything for them.|`|f5f104d9bba82b1d2b25f66a4e93cd5eaa	Sneaking Up On The Monkey, by InternetPosterChild<br>  <br>  That is an excellent book.

Black girls have high standards & are also sadly stuck on image (& money)....we don't want to be seen with a guy that other girls don't approve of. Every girl wants that guy who all the other girls want, just to say "I know u want him but he's mine! Mmm don't he look so good!!" lol Or it could be that since u've been with white girls or even cuz ur mixed that they feel they couldn't "connect" with you.|`|2193ae92b5caad4992891d4679fe4eefaa	It is a little harder but worth it.

9814f435abd199b5cc130bad7b28d421aa	I find it very important in our relationship to hear the words I love you quite often throughout the day, but more importantly I would rather my partner show me how much he loves me by the little things he says and does for me.  A man can tell me 100 times a day he loves me, but if he doesn't show me, his words mean nothing.|`|e7ed58b1d2d49cbe25310d3a823c36a7aa	Its not important how much they say it, but if they say it or not. Its something good to hear before you go to bed. And besides, if they were to die during the night I would regret not saying it to them beforehand.|`|826f70b2690f8b557c1f999a90401a8faa	It affect me, I like to hear the word. I dont know why maybe Im just too depress. And  when you expect it to come and all you hear is silence... well....|`|d6adf127e18eaf49bc08849fa03babcfaa	Yes it is important . and if you have to drag it out of him you feel it isn't worth hearing because it should be his feeling not your.Do you try saying it first?|`|e34fe10b551a455e23510d868cb71a7eaa	I would like to hear it but it rarely happens. It bothered me for years that he wouldn't say it but he shows me he loves me in many ways.<br>  <br>  A different man told me he loved me but did not show it. I'll take my husband's quiet ways.<br>  <br>  His parents never said it but at least my husband says it to our children.<br>  <br>  When I really needed to hear it was when I doubted his love. I don't doubt it anymore so I'm okay. And when I do want to hear it I look and say "Thanks honey, I love you too!" and we both laugh.|`|fc7117280cedb9017461839769b2c21daa	yes to hear, read, anything anyway they can say it...if they mean it..they should say it, i've always believed if a man starts off saying i love you like 20 times a day and a year later he barely says it at all..things have changed and he's probably cheating...so to me I LOVE YOU is a phrase i can't get enough of
2620dd6865bb5f83f9a0a2582f75a8bbaa	It's all in this guys court. If he breaks up with his g/f then you might have a chance at something, but you really can't do much till then. Just be friendly with him but you should start looking for other guys, cause waiting for someone to "possibly" break up with their g/f will just eat away at you.|`|AA11397101	I'm not sure. Sometimes friends lie so you won't get hurt. If he really liked you, he would dump his current girlfriend and ask you out. Trust me, I've been through this scenario a million times.|`|AA12024620	Steer clear of anyone that says he'd break up with his girlfriend for you.  Apparently he's not one to be trusted.|`|b228c36ea6276bbf80b4b252a1bb2b8daa	LMFAO. This is soooo ironic this happened to my friend, but of course she didn't go out with the guy.<br>  <br>  The most obvious thing I have to say about the guy is...<br>  HE`S A PLAYER! even if he say he isn't, think about it for a moment. Since he's going out with someone right now, and he's trying to hook up with someone else at the same time and would break up with his girlfriend later, means that he's a player and would do the same thing to you. I suggest you not to go out with him.<br>  <br>  But if he insist he isn't and you still don't believe my "player" theory.  I have no idea what to say, but that if his girlfriend finds that you were the cause to their break-up can you say, "DRAMA", I suggest you wait awhile to go out with the guy, and see how it works out at the end. If he doesn't like his girlfriend anymore there is really no point in them going out, because he is just leading her on. So do whatever you think is right.|`|f0484e945af0df7218a78f2a5c1358e4aa	hunn  u should not worry about girls . there all drama . thats all they are.  worry about urself . and keep ur confidence up just because he has a girlfriend . u just be urself and dont try to be his girlfriend . u never no what could happen . he could turn out to be a jerk for all u know . but thast not the point . if he really likes u . he would go out with u . just keep being urself . and confidence up . who cares about his gf|`|767fd71f931856f7e4e2fe8bf027c74caa	that's one of the nastiest things you could ever do.<br>  think about his girlfriend instead of yourself.<br>  would you honestly ever want that to happen to you?<br>  you have a boyfriend <br>  but someone prettier comes along.<br>  <br>  no more boyfriend.<br>  <br>  hmmmmmm.......|`|17bba31defb7b1bc925729452d27c386aa	this guy is playing games , also how would you like it if some one took him away from you if he was yours.

Your friend has serious alcohol problem and if she is not having sex with one of these guys at least once in a while I would be surprised. If this does not fit into your life style say goodbye.

I think body language can be a pretty good indicator of a person's interest or lack thereof. Here are some examples: If the other person's body is angled towards you; if their posture is mirroring yours in some way (eg if they cross their legs/do things with their hands similar to what you are doing, for example playing with a drink coaster etc) ; if they maintain steady eye contact - look you in the eyes as they talk to you.  Be good to you.<br>  <br>  Physically speaking, touching your arm or knee (for eg) to make a point, as they're speaking with you, it doesn't have to be constant either. <br>  <br>  A person who is interested in you will engage you with their eyes as they talk to you, they won't be looking around the room, their eyes will be locked onto you and vice versa, if you want them to know that you are interested. They won't be subconsciously looking around the room for something else to hold their attention.<br>  <br>  Other than body language, it would be a perfect world if we all just came out with it and told someone we're interested but that would take away the element of mystery and fun - hence the "chase."<br>  <br>  I think that if someone likes you and wants to see you/date you, they WILL make the effort. If they truly are interested, they will do whatever it takes to get YOUR attention, they won't leave it to chance, in case someone else grabs your attention before they do.  I think the opposite sexes will always have difficulties in figuring each other out. At the end of the day we need to give ourselves a break, we're only human. Just go with the flow, trust your instincts, but most importantly, know what makes YOU happy - and do it. The rest will follow.|`|0068930d0f50936c123000e0876f0bc7aa	Does he act stupid around you?

They don't know how to make friends.  Sometimes I think that if he really did have a few friends then he would be a whole lot easier to live with.<br>  <br>  Pray that he finds a friend.

AA10112452	First off, it is true that conduct speaks louder than words. So I can understand you wanting to "show" him that you like him as opposed to "telling" him that you like him. But, you know what? In some situations words are just better. Sometimes you need to make that first step... or that person will never know. Maybe instead of saying hi to him... the next time you see him say "hello... and how are you today?" Then the next time you see up with "hey... how are you today... I like that shirt you are wearing... where did you get it? Then next time you see him.... say "hey... how's it going... you got plans for the weekend?" Make sure you say the last thing on a Friday! Hee-hee<br>  <br>  I'm mean, basically what I'm saying... is that casual conversation with this guy can show him that you are interested. As time progress... you can progress with the conversation you bring up with him. Be bold! Sometimes... tradition goes out the window in regard to the guy making the first move. But this way... you are making the first move in a very subtle way.<br>  <br>  He will start to realize... "hey... I think this girl is interested in me." He will go back and tell his friends what you are doing... and they will say... "yeah dude, sounds like she likes you... ask her out!"<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|407fd68d9c30c48c6aca352eb86de56eaa	You need to find a way to have more contact.  Obviously, just saying "Hi" won't cut it.  Run into him more often--on purpose.  When you talk to him, remember to smile a lot, laugh a lot (this is a hard one to do without sounding fake), and do some light touching: elbow, forearm, or shoulder.  A large percentage of men will pick up on these simple cues.<br>  You can escalate the contact slowly, and decide for yourself when you've done enough:<br>  Stop by his desk/office to say hi<br>  As you get to know him better, maybe a coffee break together? <br>  Invite him to meet you (and other work friends?) after work.<br>  Actually tell him...<br>  <br>  As always. make sure he's not already attached.|`|563e9d8f261837c6efada470a9ef07abaa	Put it on your t-shirt, that is a good way to show him.|`|c2f2a00a3e2d7b7986d878385aef757faa	Take the risk. He may feel the way you do, to shy to make the first step. Before you let him slip away because you don't want to be the first one to say something, just give him your number if he calls you know, if he doesn't it's his lost. But I feel he will. It's not true that women are the one who is afraid of make the first move, some men are. Many things pass us by in life because of fear. Don't be afraid of conversation. It's only words of life.|`|32dbc6294cfba20a9ec0c35094c418a3aa	i went through the same thing and my co-worker went to him and just told him how i felt. and found out he liked me too but wasn't sure how i felt we've been talking ever since that day for 6 months now :)|`|5562021a2960e356bab43ee9d55c0ca5aa	Ask about something incidental ... and once he says something smile at him and maybe pirouette. Wear someone modest yet sexy (unfortunately whether you liek ti or not guys will respond to this and it may make him notice your personality more) .. also always laugh at his jokes and maybe give him a playful punch .. I get turned on as hell when fit girls do this to me.

In fact - I would feel like the man. So I guess it sort of requires more information but if you are doing a man then a quick call from the old one shouldn't be a problem.

WEgxTRnOaa	Okay I'm in high school, and she definitely wants to let you know that she is going to that dance. She is trying to make you jealous and see how you'll react. When girls are flirting with you they laugh at stuff you say that isnt even funny. If she trys to sit by you whenever she can, she wants to be near you. If you see her after school gets out, just walk right up to her and say, "hey do you wanna walk home with me?" If there are people around she might say no because she could be embarrased, or she could say yes because she really likes you. If there is no one around, and she says yes, she could like you or feel sorry for you, but if she says no, then just say, "okay thats cool" and walk away. If she likes you, then she will say wait a minute and you will probably end up walking home together. Just play it cool and act totally like yourself!<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|2cb32fbc78f58602884a90a7376a3dc8aa	middle school huh? me too. infact, if wish zane would do that to me. i mean, gawd, its basically the exact same thing. if i didnt know any better id say you were zane, but i know better...i am telling you that wen she is sitting by you tall her ask her to the dance! gawd i do the same thing to zane but i swear its like he is just so nervous! gawd it gets so weird sometimes, i mean i swear he was about to ask me to the dance but rebe wanted me to talk to her in private and so i was unabhle to know whut he was gunna say. so please, for the love of gawd tell her!|`|AA11073004	Hmm this is what I do when I'm around this boy I like.

Later on in life, you'll find out that things will not always go your way but you just have to roll with it.  Just because a girl doesn't like you, it's not the end of the world, there lots of girls out there and believe me, you'll find her.  Who knows, maybe she does share the same feelings you have so go for it.  You're very young so don't take things too seriously.   Enjoy life and have fun!!!|`|AA11125156	she seems like she really trusts you which is a very good thing. she might have a crush on in some wy, you'll never...if you guys dont go to the dance together go and make sure you danc with her or chill with her that night, let her ad make her feel special|`|e3ba1bb46f922e8d6e97f87b8c137b38aa	oh go for it u dont have anything to lose ask her out before its too late
9c66f6103446c75d964fdae11267fb33aa	If that is truly how you feel about him, then you should break it off with him. You don't belong together. You can't keep him just because he "seems so perfect", when you feel no real connection to him. This is definitely not fair to him. And not fair to you either. You both deserve the chance to find that other person who will set your hearts to racing every time they are near, who you miss terribly when they are not with you, and who has you waking up smiling because you know you're going to see them that day.|`|33a3daf55723dbd5971540b1b28e71efaa	Maybe your not ready for a commitment. Because if you love him and he seems like he's perfect for you, why wouldn't you see a future? Maybe you cant see it because your not ready to see it.|`|461dae280c0b3cf8f55710872d10e651aa	I think you have a feeling that somewhere down the line, you'll find out hes not the guy you thought he was.

If not, maybe you should just be friends.|`|bca5303180c8b364fc5a2f2fbbd3c472aa	Ok i'm going to try and act like i really know what i'm talking about like a professional, and try to analyse your question.<br>  <br>  you began with:<br>  "My boyfriend seems so perfect but..."<br>  <br>  Since you said he 'seems' intead of he 'is'... so perfect, this kinda says to me that you're seeing something in him that you're not sure is an illusion. Maybe you're not conciously thinking this, and maybe you feel he's too good to be true. Let me tell you now (even though i probably have no place to) he is not perfect. He appears that way, but i don't think he is.. And thats just fine, because he's human. Maybe you just haven't been together long enough to find the flaws.<br>  <br>  Dig deeper, find out more about him. There was a saying on the OC 'you can never completely know someone - thats what keeps you interested'. Admit this to yourself - that you don't KNOW him completely and you never will, for anyone. There's always more to it.<br>  <br>  So yeah, stick around. maybe you're bored - thats ok too. you'd need some drama in that case. But it sounds like you love him, and your heart aint stupid. You love him for a reason. <br>  <br>  Find out more about him - the deeper stuff, or admit that you need something more... <br>  try and find WHAT it is you need.|`|ea20852a0c8f58f3bdcf81256f224cbaaa	Well, make sure you love him for real. If you really do, then you are probably the independent type, who doesn't feel the need to be around her man 24/7. It's okay, I'm one of those too.<br>  I love my man but when I want to do things alone, he understands. If I feel like being myself or hanging out with my girlfriends, he's okay with that too as long as I find time for him as well. You have to make him feel special when you're together and make him understand that just because you're not always together doesn't mean you love each other less.<br>  As I've told him before " Give me time to miss you!"

The first thing that will attract me is chemistry. If she is easy to talk to and there is a comfort level. If a guy is willing to spend time with you, then he probably likes you.

If a guy asks you out he's feeling you. If a guy goes out of his way to please you or get your attention then he's into you.<br>  <br>  4.I wish girls knew that not all guys are dogs. I wish that girls knew that men are capable of being honest and faithful to thier woman. <br>  <br>  5.The very first thing that I notice about a girl is her smile that first initial eye contact and the smile that follws it's simple but sometimes says a lot. <br>  <br>  6.The first attraction to a girl comes when I first talk to her and her level of confidence, intelligence and overall demeanor  outshines her beauty. <br>  <br>  7.Women need to know that men are men and women are women. We are different for a reason. There are  thins that women pick up on faster than men. We can't all read between the lines like women do and don't work well with hints and clues. If there is something that a woman wants to know then just come out and ask without sending messages that we might get twisted or just don't get at all. <br>  <br>  She needs to have a great personality. She needs to be able to communicate and not hold things in. She needs to be able to love me and allow herself to be loved. She has to be honest with me and herself. And most of all she has to be faithful if we are in a relationship. <br>  <br>  The physical stuff doesn't matter much. Of course I need/want to be attracted to her but I'm not gonna say I won't date a girl that has this or dosn't have that.

Try not to worry about realationships at the moment you have the rest of your life to find somebody.

Mostly just keep positive.|`|54048f431e23af198481432570ea86bcaa	Living at home is hard.  I hated it.  The real answer may be to sweat it out until you can move out and have your own life.
aKpIuNAFaa	very bad advice is being given, till now. move on pal! nobody likes a whiny needy puppy dog, yes they may be cute, and fun to play with, but they don't do well in relationships. she clearly isn't into you, and please don't go treating her like some princess, because you'll screw up your chances for sure then. treat her like a bratty little sister instead, make fun of her, how she dresses, bust on her, and don't let up. try to be unavailable to her, like you have better things to do than wait around for her. i can guarantee thats what this guy is doing with her, he is making her feel like he is unavailable to her, so she wants him even more, don't ask me to explain how or why this is, it just is, and i'm sharing it with you, which i prolly shouldn't, but there you go, good luck.|`|31e2812ba8d774ab20eb2a5c9bfb9ff8aa	Back off but stay in touch, show her that you are a true friend and are there for her and waiting for whenever she is ready.|`|4f2a4bba2cbbe17325c4464d6dcef620aa	Give her time.  Eventually, this other guy will break her heart.  Then just be the best FRIEND that you can be.  Soon, she can soon appreciate you for YOU, and then you can think about taking your "friendship" to a new level.  Be really sweet to her, and don't treat her like dirt whatever you do!  Treat her like a PRINCESS.|`|Q7C9WJngaa	look Rusty i know you like me and u have no ******* clue whats happening in Louis and I's relationship! you just told me you changed your mind b/c you don't like the way i act around my guy friends...tear ******* tear...i'm sick of hearing what you think will happen in my relationships..if ya wanna predict people's lives become a ******* therapist or something...one day you want me and the the next you don't you're always telling me how my relationships are going to end up...you have no clue what happens in Louis and I's relationship...and you dont know why we broke up in the 1st place....a lil hint....listen to some of these people and back off for a lil bit....ur sufficating me on what you think is going to happen!|`|0dcd33eea2559058152d4045b222a6c1aa	She doesn't know what she wants. Its best that you leave her alone. Maybe then she'll be able to come to a decision! I mean its just a RULE that you can't date two people at the same time.. then there is also a possibility that she's playing head games. But its up to you whether you want to keep pursuing her or moving on.|`|uJLqKfdpaa	Find someone else. The one you want is already taken. As tough as it is to say YOU MUST MOVE ON. If you two are meant to be together then you eventually will be but don't sit around waiting. You are wasting valuable time. She will come around to your thinking if she really cares for you but don't wait.

BUT BEWARE, since she works with you, a break-up in the future will be VERY uncomfortable AND awkward at work. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|s63Ivb4Caa	You gotta move on. Common sense would tell you that if you hook up with someone that is already in a relationship, she will either 1. Do it again, and this time you'll be the one in the wings watching her elave you for the next guy, or 2. Be of an unfaithful character and cheat on you daily.<br>  You deserve more than that. Besides, don't always consider the slapping and the smiles to be flirting. Girls are more and more becoming "playa" material too. You might just bevictim of a common male fault...emotional infatuation...chances are you have been infatuated a lot. I know I have, then it calms down and enters the realm of boredom.<br>  Hope I helped.<br>  PS. Why would you want to be the type of person that helps a girl cheat? That would only mar your own character.
74e11e68b5d4a93adef3bdaaea7c5eb2aa	i think most people are naturally shy, however the more you step out of the place that you feel comfortable the better it is going to be the easier it is going to get and then your cirlce will open and get bigger and you will be able to do more before you get shy.  Put yourself out there you may not have another chance again i wuld take it the worst thing that is going to happen is he would just be leading you on and then you will find out that he may just be a dick so it was better that way good luck live your life to the fullest it will over before you know it and you will want to remember everything before it is gone.  Do you want the story where you put yourself out there and tried and maybe get him or the other story where you were too scared and he found another girl to flirt with you decide.  take it slow and good luck|`|QMczWC9vaa	JUST GO WITH THE FLOW!!!!!!!!!!!

RXUV6JPIaa	dont get played... you decide whether or not you really want to be with him... actions speak louder than words... if he doesnt show enough love for you then he's just holding on until he find someone better... or maybe you have something he really like about you... and some parts he doesnt... "communication is the key"... find out what he really wants... and if there isnt a straight answer... it just means he just isnt really interested to answer... or not interested in you anymore... find out... so you know what you should do about it... get it over with and move on...|`|dfdebe267ec59fc1485415181c905f3daa	Its over-move on!|`|83b1df2ee5dbd86debbf8d608a873e4eaa	thats weird|`|AA10222790	He probably doesn't want you around bc he thinks you still like him.|`|YiWsitazaa	I don't exactly know the personality of the guy you're talking about, but I'll answer as best as I can.<br>  <br>  This guys sounds like he's moved on, he's found someone else, maybe while you two were dating, likes her better, though still likes you, and this is the only way he knows how to do it.<br>  <br>  I had a friend who had a girlfriend for three years, until one day he found the girl of his past that he had been in love with forever, deep feelings coming back, etc. He explained to his girlfriend and broke it off for a couple of weeks. He still loved his previous girlfriend, but because he found this new girl, the less contact with his previous girlfriend the better, only because he still had feelings for her, and didn't want that to ruin the relationship he truly wanted.<br>  <br>  I think this guy still has feelings for you, but he wants to be with another girl/another job/another interest more than you. He's prioritizing, and avoiding you because he knows if he's with you, you'll be a distraction from what he really wants. He calls you still because he doesn't want to completely hurt you, or hurt himself by severing you off completely.<br>  <br>  I know a guy who's married now, and he doesn't hang out with his previous girlfriends because in some way or another he has/had feelings for them. The best way to stay faithful to his wife is to avoid any reunions with his previous girlfriends. So there's that too, he's not married, but he's committed to something else and the only way to avoid breaking or ruining it entirely is to put you aside for now.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd give him space. Still offer to be friends, be there for him, but don't push him past phone calling. It's not your problem, it's really his, and it doesn't matter if he does or doesn't want to be with you (I think he does want to be with you, because of that he's  avoiding you to focus on other things he thinks at the time is more important).<br>  <br>  By telling him you are seeing someone, or even seeing someone, probably gives him the heads up that he might loose you (thus pushing him to really prioritize) or to realize that what he's committed to is what he really wants. He may keep in contact if he's mature enough to be friends, but if he still wants you, it may be difficult for him.<br>  <br>  I say, be available for friendship always, if you still want to be with him, being his friend will pay off because he will come back to you if he can trust you and have that connected relationship. If you still want to be with him, this is probably the wisest decision. <br>  <br>  If he wanted to date you, he still would be. There's something in his life that's taken priority. Just don't push him, and he'll respect you for it. Who knows, he'll realize what he's loosing and come back to you. You just have to wait.<br>  <br>  My friend went back to his girlfriend once the thing he committed to turned out to be a mistake.|`|hCSktkAnaa	no|`|Ab7FBv9Vaa	I'm sorry, but he probably wants to get whatever fellings he has for you out of his system. He probably thinks that not hanging out with you is the best way, because there are still feelings, but there is probably another girl in the picture that he wants.|`|e39da1121eb695e3713cb1586aa504d7aa	Just be your sweetest and most likeable self,and go out with the next guys who ask you...or ask one out you've always thought was cute. And just have fun as much as you can.  Don't call him.  Read Ruiz's Four Agreements so you can use this time to grow as a person and be strong.  The future is unpredictable.  Maybe your boyfriend will come back and maybe you'll meet someone so splendid you'll be thanking the lord you didn't get stuck with this boyfriend.  Remember, you can't predict the future, but you can be your best self and you'll find that everything is okay, no matter what happens.|`|f24a93b4018b617f709f3ea6b0c43f5faa	id totaly blow him off and geton with things hell be wanting u alter but honestly someone that just wants to be ur friend aint worth it<br>  TELL HIM TO KISS UR BUJM|`|ff67f9a1b75ac2c739e9a7031b2da243aa	I dont think that he wants to be with you as far as a girlfriend or friend.

Planteale la duda, que no te tenga tan segura.<br>  <br>  PD a tu segundo mensaje: viste que te dije que te iba a llamar? y ahora el nuevo dilema, salgo o no salgo. No salgas. Tenelo un poco en vilo, que no sepa que pasa, que te siga él, que se preocupe, y vos una lady, le decís que estás bien, pero que lo estás pensando, que no sabés, que lo querés mucho pero no sabés que hacer, que tenés otros compromisos. No salgas, en serio.

B7fwX7HAaa	Are you attractive?  I mean that doesn't do it all, but it helps.  And if you are feeling a little behind, show the girls that you want to impress that you don't want them.  In other words, be your own person, do the things that yo u love, show how wonderfully you can do them.  When you pass them in the hallways, make eye contact say hello.  If you get the nerve to ask them out, walk up to them and just bluntly ask (no quivering or shaky voice) and say, "hey you want to go out sometime" leave it casual.

If he goes back to his ex and doesnt have feelings for her or has more feelings for another girl, it is just using her to bide time until the other girl turns 18. Esp if he continues to talk to the girl he just recently broke up with. He is confused but once the picture becomes more clear, the ex he went back to will be out of the picture.

fc7117280cedb9017461839769b2c21daa	ok well i can only speak from what i know. I've been in my fair share of sh*t relationships, and everytime i've come out of one i jump into another...most have worked out bad. there were things about me i just didn't know....but there was one guy who was my friend through all of it, i've known him for years and he's always been the one to hear my trouble and want to help. one night without thinking I told him I loved him and i found out later it was the first time he had ever heard it before. I had gotten into a relationship with a scum bag and my friend was still there, nearly got married to the douche; and it was then that my friend decided to lay it out there, guess he thought he was going to lose me forever. he said he loved me and he always had and he told me that he loved that he was the one i ran to when i was in need of a friend, yes there can be rebound but some are more...he was, i stayed in my crap relationship even though i knew my friend loved me, i couldn't see myself being that woman who drops men for the next one who comes along...boy i wish i had. he cheated on me and took a lot of my money...and all i had was the arms of my friend to crawl into...he promised me that he could see me for who i was and that he loved me for what he saw, that never again would i go through what he has seen me suffer through and if i just gave him the chance he would make it right...he thinks he's the rebound then show him he's not, let him know that he's been there and seen you even when your own husband( ex now) wouldn't and that you've loved him for as long if not longer than he's loved you.|`|44tPmsHpaa	Dont rush it since you both have been divorced you know he just might want to take it easy so just take your time and dont rush if you rush you ill push him away
adc01694a0318eb28d44a17e75675ecaaa	Until you see something to let you know that they are together don't be jealous. If she is a true friend she wouldn't do something like that to you. However, if he is flirting with her it could be possible that he likes her...whatever you do don't tkae it out on your friend unless she stabbs you in the back. I promise you will find someone else to like if this guy ends up not working out. <br>  <br>  ?So don't worry about it and be you. ?|`|39169c1c8ba872240e023bff06bebb82aa	well she doesnt like him so dont worry.|`|d1d02b5717a287480cfbea932dce6300aa	You need to ask your friend whether she likes him or not, if you like him you go for it! If he likes you and your friend still says bad things, you ask her why! 9 times out of 10 its jealousy and real friends should support and encourage you when you want something. <br>  <br>  She isnt a friend if she continues like this with him, follow your heart hun! Your only young once....|`|8d2b4311f2fe2d187e4fffd77d2d27bfaa	They could just be friends but why dont you ask your friend whats going on between them? Also you should hang out with the guy more and show him that you like him :]|`|0e43d585b07d0106ec017b644cc5d5f8aa	maybe you should ask your friend
adc01694a0318eb28d44a17e75675ecaaa	My man is an aries and he is wonderful and very attentive. I don't think that a mans sign can determine everything about them, It could be that he just likes to have some space since most aries are indepnedent. or maybe he just isn't that into you. I am not saying that this is the case but test him. Call him less and give him some space, if he starts calling you more and wants to know why you are talking to him as much, then there is a good chance that he has just been busy doing his one things.
zPMm8lwlaa	Bad boys are just so hot. They are fun to be around with. Well most of us girls like the bad boy look. Nice guys are not unattractive to me. I rather be with a sweet guy that will treat me like a princess. Bad boys don't make very good boyfriends. That's what I think.|`|855e0ad4dc0c4a247a81ece278370ae7aa	We want a bad boy for the bedroom and a good guy for the rest of the house.  =)|`|fc7117280cedb9017461839769b2c21daa	ok since your question had two parts, my answer will too, lol.<br>  the "jerk" as you put it is attractive only as far as he makes a good screw...the nice guy in this area may be great but something about that assh0le attitude turns women on...nothing personal, consider them a show piece cause what they really wanna come home to is the sweet affectionate funny man who will treat them like a queen.
RlBvBarOaa	People say things like that like "My parents are going to kill me if they found out..."  I doubt that the parents would kill you but they might make your life a living hell.  So in this case i didn't Think he is going to kill himself he is just trying to express his feelings.  <br>  I think you should tell him|`|4d3f2d0c0541221ed16ded1b29990dfcaa	Sweety the first thing you should do is find some other girls that would like to go out with him and then tell him and then say that these couple of girls came up to me and they want to go out with you and tell him that he is too good for her! Hope you do the right thing and nothing bad happens to your brother.|`|d00f7127cd205b89622e216ebd2ad53caa	Oh my goodness, this is a tough one.  Well for starters, you could go to his girlfriend and talk to her and ask her why is she doing that to him and let her know how bad he is suffering.  Then tell her she needs to talk to him and let him know.  Talk to your brother about his emotions because this is serious.  You should also tell your parents about what your brother is thinking about doing if he means what he says so you can step in and get him some help!!  Other people may say butt out of his business or whatever but don't do it because he IS your brother and I know you love him and you don't want to see him get hurt.  Now that I'm thinking about it some more, instead of "talking" to the girlfriend, CONFRONT her about her cheating ways and set her straight!!  She needs to be responsible for her actions and you may be just the right person to get that through her head.  I hope your brother doesn't mean what he says because we know that this girl isn't the right one.  Love does have its ups and downs and it sucks cause everyone does experience heartache.  But by that can only make your heart stronger and you will know what is real and what isn't.  I'll keep you and your brother in my prayers that he will be strong and resilient from whatever may happen in this situation.
kAk96KXuaa	I ask myself the same question all the time. I grew up having a lot of punk friends that were all guys, and since I was sort of a tomboy they came to me with girlfriend advice, even the one I secretly liked. I guess guys just don't read some of the hints their girl best friends put out. Who knows why, but that is how it always seems. My best bet would be that you should just tell him that you like him. It may catch him off gaurd, it may make him re think your relationship hopefully taking it up a notch. You'll never know unless you try. Best of Luck!!|`|311b9e3cef72a321f2d516a7ea1a04c1aa	Too complex to answer without knowing you personally. I mean, are you acting like "one of the guys" when you are with friends?

Pero claro tarde o temprano se extra?a a la prostituta y ahi es cuando se desencadenan los conflictos matrimoniales, separaciones y diborcios. A si que bueno se?oritas, se?oras y mujeres en general presten mucha atencion a lo que acabo de desir y pongan en practica la parte que les falte para completar la formula perfecta y ser felices con su pareja.

e1dc61fe86e4539f88ffde7d3e99425aaa	I think the only reason try to lower someone else's self esteem, is because there self esteem is low also and they think it makes them feel better when it really makes them look like crap.

Then give her some time to think about it, as in don't hurry her.  then work it from there.  <br>  I was actually in a situation in that and i kinda just decided to just say "i love you" at the end of our phone conversation but for my situation it was okay tho because we were both hinting at each other that we liked each other but we didn't do much about it cuz we had a distance factor.|`|a8Hv3rCkaa	Acknowledge that you may sound like a stalker. Say 'hey, youre so cool. Id love to meet you in person. I realise that may make me sound like a stalker. Im happy to meet you in public / call you first / etc'.

When we first see a guy, we do not immediately see his personality or his level of intelligence. We see his image first. All women, however, have a different idea of what is attractive to them. Some like tall men, others like short men, some like buff guys, others like skinny little shrimps, whatever.<br>  <br>  Then, women tend to look a little deeper. I mean, what good is a hot guy if he’s, for example, an absolute dumb ***, cheating jerk with a racist sense of humour. Then he’s no longer attractive, no matter what he looks like.<br>  <br>  Women like good looking, presentable guys that other women can drool over. No woman want’s a man that no one else wants. Women don’t want the unwanted – and it’s the same for guys. Women like nice, understanding guys who know how to hold a conversation and, generally, men who have at least half a functioning brain. Personally, I can’t stand unintelligent men. I just can’t talk to them. Women like men with interests – they don’t have to be the same as ours – as long as their genuine. We don’t like guys who like everything we like just to please us. We like individuals. <br>  <br>  We like honest, trustworthy men, with good hearts, and a nice sense of humour.<br>  <br>  Most of all, we like men who respect us and know how to treat us like people – not like a piece of meat.<br>  <br>  That’s about it.|`|301f5cadfb5647026968feecdf0cd37faa	We like sweet,caring,understanding guys.

9a101650ac28e5e89dfbb71222bc8d2faa	QUIEN DIJO Q A LAS MUJERES NONOS GUSTA EL SEXO!!|`|mZNesA53aa	Querido Arturo, es una pena que en tu vida hayas conocido mujeres de las cuales puedas hablar que no les interesa el sexo. Yo creo que son asexuadas las que vos conociste pero no todas somos así. Hay quienes vivimos el sexo con placer, con deseo, con pasión. Hay quienes renacemos después de un momento amoroso, Hay quienes buscamos al hombre para hacer que se sienta deseado, objeto de nuestras más ardientes pasiones. Hay quienes esperamos a que este hombre, por el cual salen chispas de nuestros cuerpos, para volar hacia el espacio infinito cuando lo estamos tocando y adorando. Arturo, a veces las mujeres se muestran así indiferentes porque sus compa?eros no las motivan a mostrar su verdadero ser que -estoy segura- es ardiente como las llamas. Sólo hay que tratar de acercarse a la mujer con la cual quieres vibrar demostrándole tu interés, las cualidades que le gustan de vos y hacerle sentir que es lo más importante en tu vida. Para muchas de nosotras, Arturo, el sexo no es un trabajo o una obligación sino el momento en que le mostramos a nuestro hombre cuánto nos interesa con caricias, pasión, palabras suaves al oído y todo lo que nos provoca cuando nos deshacen como pétalos de margaritas en un volcán en erupción...|`|f64f68a77113a1585df557d50a6daba1aa	Yo soy muy sexual y tengo una pareja estable hace a?os, pero conozco gente que está sola por a?os y canaliza la líbido en otro lado.|`|210420403e9f3a2b48864c3537a2bba0aa	Porque es verdad.......|`|66c5ade3a759bfd01bcfc9c5a6536196aa	Podemos vivir un tiempo pero no siempre, estamos vivas y sentimos pero podemos durar màs tiempo que el hombre sin tener relaciones.|`|EGhI76Opaa	Yo no podria vivir sin sexo... cuando pasa mucho tiempo y no tengo sexo me masturbo casi todos los dias, y cuando tengo sexo tb...jaja|`|GsoMShcVaa	mira solo las que estan consagradas en un convento lo puedo creer, pero efectivamente las mujeres le damos mas importancia a mas cosas no solo el sexo, pero no quiere decir que no no nos guste y no tengamos necesidad. en mi caso no es lo mismo sexo que hacer el amor.<br>  <br>  saludos|`|1130e618705307625f49cad5bd61f3c5aa	es que el sexo no es lo más importante para nosotras, si es escencial, pero no lo más relevante en la lista. no me voy a morir si no tengo relaciones|`|951022abca26f8ea8c54fb8e822b06e1aa	Bueno, si lo piensas un poco quizas estés de acuerdo con mi respuesta: El sexo es lo que el cuerpo te pide para llevar a cabo la reproduccion... y que se necesita para la reproduccion? un ovulo y un espermatozoide... quiere decir que cada ovulo le pide a la mujer que tenga sexo para ser fecundado (o sea una vez al mes) mientras que el hombre tiene MILLONES de espermatozoides pidiendole desesperadamente que tenga sexo CADA DIA DEL A?O para continuar perpetuando la especie... ves la diferencia???? entonces no quiere decir que seamos asexuadas, es solo q nuestros cuerpos son diferentes...<br>  <br>  En todo caso, yo siempreeeee quiero sexo! jejeje...|`|AA10492394	es falso, nadie puede vivir sin sexo, hasta los padres que deben practicar celibato tienen actos pederastas|`|AA11805050	Por una mujer que no te quiere dar lo que tu deseas nos estas acusando a todas.<br>  Muchas mujeres deseamos lo mismo y hasta mas de lo que ustedes desean; la diferencia es que nosotras no perdemos la cabeza ni el sentido de la razon, por esas dos cosas habemos miles que somos muy fieles a nuestra pareja.  Para nosotras es asi: si un bebe esta llorando y estamos en lo mejor de una escena sexual; nosotras paramos y vamos a ver lo que el bebe necesita; ustedes no, ustedes continuan sin importarles el bebe.  Nosotras tambien quisieramos tener sexo por lo menos una vez al dia todos los dias; pero como nadie aparte de nosotras tiene la voluntad de hacer el quehacer de la casa, cocinar y tantas cosas que solamente nosotras hacemos; entonces ahi es donde hacemos una lista de prioridades y dejamos el sexo para lo ultimo pero no es que no querramos.

7zeEMxtLaa	Well if he has been hanging around with those guys who have heard something about you liking him, then it is likely that he has heard these rumours...The fact that he is responding to what he has heard, by talking to you and staring at you, could suggest that he is interested. If not, then he could just be playing with your feelings. However if you like him not because of his looks then it would seem as though he is a genuine nice guy and wouldn't do such a thing! I think that the best thing to do in order to limit embarrasment would be to get a friend of yours to either talk to him, or one of his close friends who has heard the rumours that you like him, and see how he really feels. If you do opt for your friend talking to his friend, make sure he is trustworthy. If your friend reports back with good news then you should definately go for it! But it may be bettter to get to know him more as a friend first..after all you gotta be friends first right?! And if he isn't interested in you, you can still get to know him as a friend, and he might change his mind as things start to bloom! Just remember he isn't the only guy in the world and you can chose whoever else you may like! Good luck =D|`|39a6451a37599c8622320036ed5ba582aa	you have a crush on a guy. first,if you wanna go for it,you have to make sure that he is available. you don't want to get a bad impression from others as a girl who rob others boyfriend.<br>  then, try to know him better. don't go straight to him and start asking questions, find it out from others. but don't over do it, people might think you're a stalker. <br>  next step is try to get close with him. try talking to him more often(start with simple words and make sure you're not babbling),to things together but most important thing of all, be true to yourself while you with him. i believe that way he can see the good in you and eventually have a heart in you.<br>  <br>  sometimes guy like girl with confident while other like shy type of girl (got my meaning?). if he say hi already that mean he may like you the way you are(but that can't be entirely true).<br>  <br>  so i think you should go with it, but don't go directly(unless you are SURE that he has a crush on you to).let him (and yourself ) know each other better,okay!|`|ANMvKgiDaa	If you want to be with him, and the feeling is mutual, I would say carry on, but with caution. If what people are saying has influenced his judgment, then he may have thought of you to be someone different than yourself. Some people are really gullible and believe whatever people tell them.

Nor would I wait to replace him.|`|dYSOIHMfaa	it depends on who it is. some women can wait 6 years. others can't wait for 6 hours. that's what sex toys are for. if that doesn't work then that's why people cheat and have sex with other people. obviously it depends on the situation, why did he go to jail... blah blah blah. if you were in jail for 6 years then would you want your bf/husband to have sex with some other girl. there's no right answer it just depends on what you feel about the relationship.
TqvatxfLaa	sabes lo que pasa es que esa relacion anterior con este chico no termino bien quedo inconclusa entonces te quedo la espinita en tu corazon de como hubiera sido si se volvian o volverian a encontrar en algun momento eso creo que es lo que te pasa,por ahi,seria bueno que se encontraran tomaran un cafe y terminar de la mejor manera...lo que quedo sin final,vas a ver que rapido dejas de pensar en el.........<br>  <br>  te deseo suerte......................|`|AA10492394	buscate otro galan, hay muchos peces en el mar, no pierdas el tiempo con ese|`|LY1fKNWIaa	El  ya reanudó su vida,y tú tienes tu pareja,así que esto,suena a pura obsesión,mejor queda te  como amiga que eres y trata de compartir más tiempo con tu pareja y si te es imposible mejor aleja te y no destruyas un hogar,por que a ti no te gustaría que te hicieran eso verdad?|`|2SEd856daa	Amiga no te sienta mal yo pienso que debe de olvidarte de el, si estuviste 2 a?os alejada de el eso indica que lo puedes olvidar. Claro que lo puedes hacer! de todas manera ya el no te quería por lo que tu dices que al volver el estaba saliendo con tu amiga significa que el ya te había olvidado también. Así que es mejor que siga con tu pareja fíjate en su cualidades y virtudes para que puedas olvidar al otro. Es lo mejor que puedes hacer olvidalo!!|`|clWVrZpWaa	suigue hacia adelante NO t rindas recuerda q tienes un futuro por delante y unas metas al alcanzar!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|fGXS3Ewwaa	es muy dificil amar a alguien que ya tiene su vida hecha ...y no es malo lo que sientes hay amores que en la vida no se olvidan y tu verdadero amor es el y aunque hagas mil cosas por olvidarlo no lo conseguiras te lo digo por esperiencia y el amor de ustedes dos es un amor limpio y sinsero por que tu quieres su felicidad y te aseguro que el piensa lo mismo que tu... habla con el dile lo que sientes te aseguro que te sentiras mejor... y creo que no es bueno vivir con alguien que solo lo quieres y que no lo amas ya que no es lo mismo amar que querer... date cuenta que solo lo estas ilucionando mas y eso no esta bien...si te das cuenta solo estas afectando a terceras personas...y creo que todavia estas a tiempo de  remediar tus herrores. haz lo que tu corazon te dicte y vive tu vida feliz.

That you would like to be a good friend and you meant nothing more serious than friendship because you like her company.  That should put her at ease.  Don't act all cavalier about it or defensive because it may be her parents do not allow her to date or she wants to be friends but not on a dating basis.  There could be a lot of reasons for her not accepting.|`|ca106532e616edadb064105bc89011e7aa	I would hope you both can continue being friends. Although I would advise you not to ask her out again.

And U may still want to be cautious of it seeming like a "doubledate"  type o thing.|`|csdGdOfxaa	I think you should stay friends, and definitely try to do some nice things for her before you ever try to ask her out again.   Because she probably knows now that you like her, she'll start thinking about what it would be like to go out with you as a boyfriend, rather than as a friend.   And if you are nice to her in the meantime, one day she might just hint that you should ask her out again.<br>  <br>  Don't ask her out again right away though.  Let her think about it.  Otherwise that's putting too much pressure on her.|`|ksq4rZ3Xaa	it's okay everyone gets rejected some time in there life and there isn't anything wrong with you still wanting to be her friend and she won't be uncomfortable around you because she has been your friend for so long so just wait

El que de pronto ya no quiere estar contigo implica muchas cosas y no buenas. Puede ser que se haya contagiado y no quiera transmitirte su enfermedad. No creo que no le gustes pues si fuera así te hubiera dejado y no estuviera pasando por eso de masturbarse cuando tiene en frente una mujer. Y como te dije si tuviera otra se hubiera ido y no pasara por esos malos ratos. Yo te aconsejo que hables con él, que le preguntes si te fue infiel, si se contagió o si le sucede algo que le afecte en su relación algo externo aparte de su relación. Conversen que esa es la mejor forma de solucionar las cosas. No estés con él hasta que no te aclare lo que le sucede.

qsdUyiiyaa	First off, this is difficult because each person reacts and will act differently with those they like or dont like. <br>  Second. Why are you on here asking sweetie? If you like her and you get along and have started a good basis for a friendship then ask her out!!! Dont wait, the worst thing that could happen is she says no, then you just continue your friendship..... Just ask her out on a date and be yourself!!!<br>  Good luck|`|864b4bd143bd9548178d217423191670aa	If shes loud when shes NOT around you and then shy and quiet around you then i would say yes.

It's not a sign, trust me. I ask that question a lot; I should know. If she get quiet when you approach her or looks at you usually, then there's a slight chance that she likes you. Not too strong of a chance though, I'm afraid.|`|dPcSEbI2aa	Well she has to be attracted to you in some way, she gets shy when your around.
cb6484c90bdeb557cd670f12c38f5ccbaa	Different strokes for different folks.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  And beauty isn't everything.  Example: Look at Brad P. and Jeniffer A.  one of the most beautiful couples in the world ad they still broke up.  <br>  Some guys are just chest guys and some guys are just butt guys.  You just have not found the right one yet.|`|ygXo8zNPaa	different guys have different taste in women. i'm sure somebody likes u just as u are|`|d74df8708ab5e745bb04019bc61888acaa	No.Will you be my new girlfriend?|`|8V07etoLaa	Ok to start off, I'm a guy and i don't think like that. I am appalled that someone would say something like that to you, it is mean and disgusting. NO! you do not need to have a certain body type to keep a guy happy. If you don't have a large "chest" size it is ok, some one would have to be really shallow not to accept you the way you are. If a guy is like that they are not the guy for you. there are tons of guys out there who will accept you.|`|AA10051908	Somewhat, but if you get described as cute, then you are ok.<br>  <br>  To further answer your question, a photo will be needed! ;)<br>  <br>  Anyways, guys are creatures who are attracted to the way things look!<br>  <br>  Women are creatures who are attracted to actions that make them feel good. (not sex things like, unexpectedly bringing home some flowers for her when you never bring home flowers, or suprising her with dinner that I've made with candles and wine, when she's the one who does all the cooking) So, yes, looks are important, but I don't think you have anything to worry about. I am personally not a boob man.  I like butts. More than a handful of boobies is too much!|`|v4p41SU5aa	No, not all guys think like that, actually I prefer a smaller chest but looks are not the most important thing.  Anyone who dumps you or doesnt want to date you because of your looks or size, is not someone you want to be involved with anyway.|`|LfxCOphcaa	No, we don't all think like that.|`|RabDWdJSaa	Most guys like a " Hot" body, and it's very rare that you find one that does'nt only care about breasts and butts, but if you are lucky, you will find one of those rare guys, until then, there is probably nothing you can do about your breast size, unless you stuff, or get implants! =P|`|UFwiGot3aa	No not all guys are the same. You sound perfect to me! I love small boobs and small frames. F- your ex,  your fine the way you are|`|a3a8421b61ecdb707b76d9d6df90bd02aa	well im not a guy but not all guys are this shallow. dont worry u'll find someone who likes u for u but for now just get out there and flirt like hell =] good luck!!|`|dPcSEbI2aa	A body is definently a plus but you should never let your insecurities get the best of you. Trust me on this, you will met a guy that will find something very beautiful  about you. A guy thats not after sex, will not care how big your chest is. I'm for real, I would know! What you don't need is a boyfriend that is always telling you you don't have a body!|`|lS4M4QAEaa	Personality means most.  But if you want my opinion on body type, yes, I prefer boobs.  When I'm with a very thin girl with little to no curve, I feel like I'm with a preteen boy.  Curves make the woman.  However, I'd rather have a girl with small breasts than a girl with fake breasts.|`|oRxpTatpaa	No, all guys don't think like that and not all guys are rude.<br>  <br>  You don't need a certain body type to keep a guy happy. If one man wants a certain look and type in his female partner, then he really should just find that and leave everyone else alone.<br>  <br>  Remember how wonderfully diverse nature is. We human beings come in all different shapes and sizes, and that is fine, wonderful actually.<br>  <br>  I suggest appreciating yourself and not letting anyone else tell you that you are somehow inferior. You are not inferior, you are not lacking.<br>  <br>  Look for the guy who appreciates you just how you are, who is good to you, who makes you feel appreciated and respected rather than trashed and disrespected.

dPcSEbI2aa	There are ways of spicing relationships up other then sex. Try going out with him, and touching more. Touch is very important, such as holding holds, hugging, and cuddeling. Eye contact is appealing also, flirt in every way! Flirt in your walk, contact everything. Talk about things your into, and have him open up. Try altering your lokks also like do something different with your hair, and make up. He'll love it!|`|ChokfzRFaa	ask him out

Tell ashlee you really value her friendship and hope you both can resolve the problem.

But I wouldn't marry an asian woman simply on the basis of her being attractive or her obedience. Marriage is not the military. I'd rather be married to an ugly duck that to be in love with a beautiful swan. Looks aren't everything. Marriage is between two people who love, trust, honor and respect eachother. Your marriage mate should be your best friend and your soul mate. Someone that you can't live without. Speaking from a mans point of view here. I think it's very important to be faithful. The divorce rate in the U.S. alone has skyrocketed over the last ten years. Love isn't what it used to be. One in two marriages will fail according to statistics. But no matter what your race, gender or status in life may be. If your marriage mate loves you and is faithful, respectful and trustworthy. You just might be the one in two marriages that survives the test of time.|`|L5C5auIsaa	Well they are very pretty but I would not marry one just for that.

bs8T1ilaaa	Tell your mother what's going on and see if she will get you the phone early.  We have a soft spot for our sons and can't stand for anyone to pick on them.  Also she'll probably fell bad for moving and making you the new kid.|`|b7d1a2b1e3d92300d36fee6e053a44aeaa	Maybe stop lying, eventhough you say you do it sometimes to fit in, but you must stop as you must be telling quite a lot that they have noticed if you can't back up the lies then it will catch up with you as it has don so in this case. You could have said my folks are "maybe" gonna get me a cell for my -day,even if your sure that they are gona get you one, you should have waited till you actually had one that way they would have known you didn't lie about it. You should talk to your friends and say you felt like to had to tell a few lies here and there to fit in to this new school and that you will not be untruthfull from now on and would they give  you a chance to prove that and there friendship means a lot to you. I don't know what kinda lies you have told them that they don't seem to trust anything  that comes outa your mouth.  I's not the end of the world trust me, when your older you will look back on it and know it was not that a big of a deal. Lean from your mistakes. Go to school and try to make new friends if the others don't come around.|`|e7a6e4ba7c085bb2119f2c1ccb15506eaa	u need to talk to one of these so called friends alone, so that they know you are serious. and say to them, seriously and truthfully something like 'i want to talk to you seriouly because some things you've said have been upsetting me' and then go on to say not to harshly how she has been making u sad and say that you are sorry for lying so that she knows u rnt looking at it one sided but explain that you truthfully are getting a mobile and stuff and also it's important that if u hit her with a serious talk she will see how effected you are and maybe she doesn't realise how much her words have effected you. you've got to show her how you feel you can't expect her to read minds i guess and if she doesn't take the serious talk-if she wont beleieve you then shes not worth it as a friend and if you have started new at the school im sure there are others who will be able to beleive you and be ur true friend. best of luck :)|`|ea1ea962dd4ba7a690294583ae84323baa	I know how you feel in middle school i had that happen all the time but now im in high school people matured and realized how stupid it was. but anyway just go to school and ignore them. Most likely they will forget about it all and talk to you again. Just spend time with your boy. I wish you the best of luck. oh yeah dont do anything stupid.|`|m4EHusIUaa	I know what its like to be new to a school, i also know what its like for all your friends to gang up on you about one silly matter. This is a really stupid thing to argue about. When you get a mobile phone?  These friends are being out of order. You need to speak to these friends tell them you arent lying, if they dont believe you then all you can let them do is calm down. You may have to go to school for a couple of days whilst still in an argument but i am sure its not that bad. Soon enough they will realise they were in the wrong and will make up with you. <br>  Maybe you could trying making new friends, is there anyone else at school who you could hang around with. This happened to me, i found new friends and now i am close with them and my old mates. Sometimes you just have to let things settle then, try and get things back to normal.

gJFqebxuaa	D'accord avec toi sur le sens des années 60, et l'essai  trop "timide" à mon go?t afin de  se battre contre le sexisme.<br>  Crois-tu que les choses aient évolué ? certainement pas; les femmes sont toujours les "potiches" de service que l'on continue à exhiber pour faire vendre.<br>  A croire que les hommes seraient tellement bêtes qu'ils ne peuvent acheter une eau de toilette par ex. que s' il y a une femme a demi nue pour la vanter!!<br>  Attention, je vois déja une levée de boucliers de votre part , messieurs.J'ai mis ma phrase au "conditionnel" (seraient...)<br>  Mais je remarque simplement que les femmes n'ont , d'aprés ce que je peux constater , besoin d''aucune image masculine pour décider de leurs choix. <br>  Quand verront-nous un homme (presque) nu nous faire l'article pour "la lessive" qui lave ses sous vétêments plus ... que plus... <br>  Serions nous , soit moins bêtes, soit moins receptives, que les hommes?<br>  En tout état de cause, la femme se trouve encore et encore comme il y a des années , placardée sur des affiches, montrée comme un objet de , sinon désir,d' attirance ou que sais-je encore, uniquement destinée à tenir éveillée la libido de quelques-uns, et malheureuement ce n'est pas demain que cela va s'arrêter .<br>  Alors, tu parles d'un progrés!!!|`|2gyLYATkaa	Une femme est avant tout un être humain que l'on doit aimer et respecter. Ce n'est pas un jouet et j'ai beaucoup d'estime et de considération pour les actrices qui font appel à une doublure.|`|vATokz3Zaa	personnellement je pense que c'est une erreur et que les femmes globalement en sont responsables.<br>  La libération de la femme passe obligatoirement par l'égalité entre sexes or : <br>  -l'égalité ne se juge pas sur la tenue mais bien sur le fait qu'au sein de la société les femmes occupent dans la même proportion les postes que les hommes convoitent et obtiennent et ceci à salaire égal <br>  -pour arriver à cette égalité les femmes ont à démontrer qu'elles sont capables de faire comme les hommes, aussi vite et aussi bien, et pour ce doivent abandonner un certain nombre des activités traditionnellement considérées comme féminines (repassage, lavage, ménage...) qui peuvent très bien être assurées également par les hommes <br>  -or en réalité on voit que au moins encore en france beaucoup des postes à responsabilité sont tenus par des hommes, les femmes à diplome et compétence équivalents se retrouvant cantonnées encore trop souvent dans les emplois subalternes, <br>  -et on voit aussi que beaucoup de parents maintiennent cette différence entre gar?ons et filles (le mécano pour le gars et la poupée barbie rose pour la fille alors que bien souvent les filles rêvent de mécano et les gar?ons ne détesteraient pas jouer à la poupée)[à titre personnel je rêvais du manuel du parfait chimiste et systématiquement j'avais droit à une poupée pour noel, poupée que je déchiquettais en morceaux pour voir comment elle était fabriquée à l'intérieur !! il y a vraisemblablement une corrélation entre mes noels ratés et ma carrière professionnelle puisque je suis devenue médecin et professeur de faculté avec un privilège redoutable et amusant puisque j'étais la première femme professeur nommée dans ma faculté : féminisation locale 0,5 % et nationale moins de 5% c'est dire !!)<br>  <br>  maintenant si l'on considère les nus féminins dans la pub, il faut reconna?tre que les agences de publicité et les médias sont encore quasiement exclusivement tenus par des hommes... <br>  ce n'est donc pas étonnant que les nus féminins s'affichent partout <br>  ce qui implicitement et explicitement  rabaisse la femme au stade unique d'objet du désir de l'homme qui choisira d'être assis devant la tv tandis que sa meuf se tapera la vaisselle debout dans la cuisine !!<br>  <br>  la solution pourtant existe et elle est très simple :<br>  -refuser systématiquement d'acheter l'objet dont la promotion passe par l'affichage d'un nu féminin<br>  -élever les filles avec un peu plus de "virilité" en leur rappelant qu'elles sont aussi intelligentes, aussi malignes, souvent plus tenaces que les gar?ons et qu'il n'y a aucune raison (ni génétique, ni familiale, ni sociale, ni religieuse) pour qu'elles soient cantonnées dans les boulots secondaires alors que leurs frères seront encouragés à devenir les meilleurs !! <br>  <br>  et croyez moi, j'ai eu trois enfants  que j'ai élevé de cette fa?on un peu égalitaire : le gar?on est bien un mec mais il participe aux activités domestiques et d'éducation de son gamin comme sa femme, et les deux filles sont bien deux filles très féminines, mais aussi de parfaites maitresses de maison et d'excellentes cuisinières !! autrement dit ce n'est pas parce que l'éducation est un peu plus égalitaire qu'à terme le gar?on sera effeminé et les filles rouleront des mécaniques !|`|xUVgykVIaa	Je ne vois pas de progrès dans le nu même pour la libéralisation de la femme.<br>  Le MLF avec des idées nobles au départ pour la libéralisation de la femme a fait fausse route par la suite .<br>  <br>  Femme objet convoitise des médias femme objet esclave encore d'une certaine fa?on de l'oeil masculin <br>  <br>  Non pour moi l'avancée dans le progrès pour la femme ne passe pas par sa nudité affichée vous êtes porteuses de si belles choses Mesdames.<br>  Alors inutile de vous dévaloriser la nudité dans l'intimité avec l'élu de son coeur.|`|TdgGnyIiaa	moi je préfère deviner mais a un moment ou a un autre la beauté doit être admiré. un pas en avant ou en arrière là n'est pas la question.|`|bfafbdb7bc1fcb486ee57638995db424aa	que les hommes en fassent autant..... à poil!!!!!|`|epfIhi40aa	J'ai toujours été contre la nudité des femmes dans les lieux publics. Dans les médiats, je crois que c'est le comble.

Le sexe marche , alors on en remet encore et encore et partout..c'est du fric facile a faire pour les americaines, elles ont juste a se renverser le flacon d'eau oxygenee sur la tete, et se faire greffer des ballons de basket  en guise de poitrine, et elles n'ont pas besoin de prendre l'air bete, car ca c'est naturel chez elles.... et donc voila ca suffit,  tous les cretins et esprits faibles  achetent. JS a son marketing base la dessus , elle n'a rien invente a part la frequentation hebdomadaire chez le chirurgien esthetique.

Même pour une pub anti calcaire on montre une femme nue. J'estime que la femme est devenue objet ca me révolte assez. TT ces pubs à connotations sexuelles tt la journée et puis on s'étonne qu'on se fait siffler et harceler ds la rue si on porte un pantalon blanc. Y en a marre du manque de respect de ces hommes qui nous prennent pr les objets de leurs phantasmes et désirs. Nos grands mère ne se sont pas battues pr que de soumises ns devenions putes!!|`|bdfee5c2041a222173b953ec7fcda474aa	Bah, de tous temps les femmes ont été déshabillées, matées, admirées, regardées, etc. <br>  La culture occidentales veut que les femmes cherchent à se faire admirer, et les hommes à admirer... <br>  <br>  Alors la nudité qui s'étend dans tous les médias n'est signe que d'un assouplissement des interdits qui faisaient loi précédemment: enlevez les tabous, la morale et les religions, et vous verrez fleurir les poitrines dénudées sur les magazines. <br>  C'est juste le fameux naturel qui revient au galop. <br>  <br>  A mon avis, c'est un progrès, dans le sens où ?a prouve que la femme est désormais libre de se montrer... mais ?a ne change rien par rapport à la relation hommes-femmes. <br>  <br>  c'est juste une preuve de la libération de la société, pas de la femme.<br>  <br>  Enfin, c'est jsute mon avis!|`|cbdbe80ce848932e8a73ce57151d1f7eaa	Cette reprise de Jessica Simpson m'a purement et simplement dégo?tée. Cette idiote en mini short ne vaut pas grand chose à mon sens, elle ne sait utiliser que le sexe pour faire vendre et c'est assez lamentable.<br>  La nudité d'une femme la met au même stade qu'un objet, si elle est admirée et désirée, elle n'est pas vraiment reconnue. Ce sont des hommes, pour des hommes, qui les mettent nues, et encore une fois, ce sont eux qui mènent le jeu.<br>  Il existe malgré cela des femmes qui font de la nudité un moyen de prendre le pouvoir, mais elles sont davantage créatrices, photographes ou autres que potiches péroxydées.|`|d0d7de2261b2f5011148a11d858b11c1aa	pas un progré mais une tendance !!|`|e8d3f739f83114618685eddf53e65d62aa	Je pense que, globalement, le fait que les femmes soient libres de se dénuder ou pas est un progrès. Ceci dit, il est clair que certaines femmes ne le font pas librement; c'est un problème parallèle à la prostitution.<br>  <br>  Mais dans l'ensemble je crois qu'une société où les gens ont individuellement le droit de choisir ce qui est bon pour eux est un progrès par rapport à celles où on leur impose des règles stictes dans tous les domaines.<br>  <br>  Je me souviens d'une speakerine de l'ex ORTF, Noelle Noblecourt, qui s'est vue virer de la télévision pour avoir porté une jupe qui descendait juste au dessus du genou. Sacrilège, elle avait montré ses genoux à la télé!!!<br>  <br>  Quelques mois plus tard, nous étions en mai 1968.<br>  <br>  Pour moi, le critère de la bonne ou mauvaise "condition" réservée aux gens, en général, c'est le degré de liberté dont ils jouissent. Si un quelconque bonheur est possible en cette vie, c'en est la condition centrale.|`|UAV78ig6aa	Pour moi, franchement je pense qu'il y en a un peu trop de nudité. Entre un film porno genre gonzo et un soft, je préfère le soft car l'autre fait trop anatomique... Une femme qui suggère sans montrer est souvent sensuelle et celle qui montre tout et un peu vulgaire :). Pour moi la révolution sexuelle n'a jamais eu lieu réellement, en effet je pense que c'est une évolution vers l'objectification de la femme... et c'est bien triste|`|WP5NAv41aa	Non, c'est une degradation feminine.

La libération sexuelle tant pr?née s'est muée en libéralisation sexuelle... <br>  <br>  La nudité à tout va est un fléau sexiste alimenté par des gens peu scrupuleux qui pensent évidemment à s'en mettre plein les po-poches, tout en faisant perdurer les clichés ("L'homme est visuel, il ne pense qu'à ?a, mais quoi de plus beau qu'une femme nue (et retouchés par photoshop, soit surtout pas naturelle) ?").<br>  <br>  Un pas en arrière, tout comme il y en à d'autres concernant nos libertés (de s'habiller comme on veut sans se faire traiter de tous les noms, de disposer d'une contraception fiable et gratuite, etc.) : restons vigilant-e-s !!!|`|bed961c9b49e8f6cd92d1e94673ca0ccaa	je préfère plus intime,plus caché .la est le vrai érotisme deviné|`|qBp7yDgCaa	A mon avis la nudité de la femme est un progrès pour la libération   féminine, comparez seulement les libertés des femmes dans les pays qui autorisent la nudité et les autres pays  qui n'autorisent pas; et vous comprenez!|`|548218b3d2f846683e5f68d679b45c8daa	pour ce la n'est pas du progrès les femmes qui sont nu pour les médias de plus en plus la femme se dégrade elle n'a plus de charme tout le temps presque nu cet une dégradation ce n'est pas ?a être reconnues dans la société au contraire ils ont jouez beaucoup pour la liberty de la femme c'est une question d'intelligence danish girl|`|ziSv6mABaa	oui et non enfa?te comme toutes les émancipations elles a ces révères|`|B3IioFMZaa	Pour moi c'est un vrai retour en arrière. En tout cas, ?a produit tout l'effet inverse que recherché si tant est que l'effet recherché soit de montrer la libération des femmes!<br>  Un corps de femme nu pour tout et n'importe quoi (yahourt, lessive, parfum...) met la femme dans la position éternelle de la femme objet! Et bien sur, une femme belle n'est pas une femme pensante mais à la disposition des fantasmes de ces messieurs!

QZ2DH1BEaa	Cheating.....leaving others hanging on.....irresponsible, flighty..  there is no reasoning to these acts. He feels down deep he is not good enough.....and acts immoral before he is found out-getting a new relationship going so he won't have to face his demons, nor go through rejection. "He needs therapy". If he does not get it, and you continue with him.... then you will need it too. There is no reasoning any well adjusted person will be able to understand....don't continue to elude yourself...he needs help, so suggest it to him after he entertains you with his idea.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Remember this: If you want to foretell someones future, their history will predict it.|`|AA11704236	I think he was stringing you along..trying to see if he still could wrap you around his finger..and now he knows he can. Now there is no reason to talk about it anymore. Dont wait around for him , start doing your own thing, and once he sees you dont need him he will come crawling to speak to you. Men work in weird ways. I did it, and he talks to me everyday about trying to work things out. just dont be rude about it, just dont be "available" everytime he wants you to be..Go out, have fun, and when he calls just tell him you are out and you will call him back later..|`|AA12123970	.

But a lot of people, especially in the US, are biased against bare feet in public so that may make her uncomfortable. I'm sure you've shown her the material from the SBL website and similar sites to show it's not truly dangerous or gross, however the social awkwardness remains... a lot of people frown on anything out of the ordinary and even if they themselves know there is no risk involved would just feel more comfortable if their partner conforms to the social norms... many people can't handle people staring at them.

Do you like your job, are you getting along with family, ect.<br>  <br>  Sometimes a break form each other is a good thing, you can think about those "little spats" and maybe let go of some things (like if he leaves dirty clothes everywhere) that may bug you about him and vise versa.

I was off jabbering with all the new kids at my school. Sometimes you cant even tell if someone is new, people might think your in a different grade or something. Your gunna be nervous your first day, heck, I was terrified, and I admit my 1st day was a little stressful trying to find all my classes, but after the first couple days, you'll be more used to it, and less nervous. So I didn't get lost, i just quickly asked the teacher after classes were my next class was, and they happily pointed it out to me.<br>  Remember to just talk to people and get to know them, dont be too shy...hope your day goes smootly. good luck.<br>  <br>  Oh yeay...and always know what number your classroom is.|`|GVanattBaa	hmm. i had that same problem last year. my elementary school was TINYYY. but the middle school i was going to go to was pretty small. the middle school i'm going to now is HUGE! haha. but. just. well.. i think you should make friends that you have classes with. it's alot easier to make friends like that then searching for someone that likes everything you  like. i'm not saying that's a bad thing but it will take time..|`|Py79jniaaa	Just be yourself. Don't get lost into those gang type crowds.

Ele empurrava as pessoas e gritava "com licen?a, com licen?a, sou parente da vítima!"... Finalmente, chegando próximo ao corpo, qual foi sua surpresa ao constatar que se tratava de um animal, um jumento... E todos ao seu redor gargalharam!<br>  <br>  Essa é uma prova de que curiosidade em excesso é um defeito.<br>  <br>  Um  abra?o!|`|115337554e500a655e4ce026b88426f3aa	Depende do nível da curiosidade...<br>   E n?o se esque?a que a curiosidade matou o gato...<br>    Mas eu costumo ser bastante curiosa....<br>     E quando é um assunto novo que mexa com minha imagina??o costumo pesquisar para me informar mais...<br>       Ent?o ser curioso é uma qualidade......|`|4603248dc9eb8b4a1b64b725b1d38dceaa	eittttttttaaaaaaaaaaaa<br>  que defeito a jujuba vê na curiosa?????<br>  <br>  hahahahahaha<br>  bjim|`|a72a1182c7ce63ca15042a922b8e20f0aa	Ao ler essa pergunta, eu me lembrei de algumas pessoas, que est?o "protegidas" pela policia, para n?o serem assassinadas, pelo fato de estarem na hora e no local errado e testemunharam, sem querer, ou movidos pela sua curiosidade, algum crime cometido por bandidos contra alguém; deve ser horrível, viver constantemente amea?ado de vida e ter que mudar de nome, identidade e cidade; as vezes, a curiosidade pode sair muito caro, afinal o peixe morre pela boca; Por outro lado, há tmb a curiosidade saudável, aquela que faz os cientistas desenvolverem uma série de objetos de consumo, para trazer um conforto para nossas vidas; Ent?o td isso, é muito relativo.

20lopYxkaa	not a very good idea to ask for her number incase she is not home and busy. just ask her upfront face to face and get any answer with expression. on phone i find its very inaccurate even vague and could even be a pranster trying to mess with ya like sister ansering saying its her so not a good validation for anything. why phone when you can send instant online message? ask her online question|`|VHp086UWaa	You can never know what a woman thinks.  They say if you did it would help because you wouldn't believe it!  You have to ask her out or for her number sometime.  It is good that you have flirted for a couple of weeks.  You see her often so you weren't in a hurry.  Don't wait too long because she will put you in that friend status and there is no escape from that.  Only problem is if she says no just blow it off and act as always.  There are a lot of fish in the sea.  So just go for it and realize that everyone is not meant to date everyone.  However if you don't ask you will never know.|`|yHbnFknNaa	See how she acts around the other guys *^^* If she is different toward you then she is to the other guys (at least 2 guys needed for this theory to work) then shes serious. You should wait to see and then if you think she likes you, ask for her number *^_^*<br>  Hope every thing works out!!:)

eNoCsU2oaa	Estas tratando de responder a esta pregunta desde tu punto de vista de mujer. Los hombres son educados y forman su identidad a través de la función de proveer. Si la mujer es entonces la mayor proveedora ellos no piensan en el beneficio que esto conlleva sino que estás atentando contra su rol dentro de la sociedad, y esto asusta.|`|09ySNh8Laa	porq los hombres siempre tienen su ego puesto en el hogar, quiero decir q como son machistas creen q pueden con todo y se sienten menos o sienten q han perdido poder en el hogar cuando pasan esas clases de cosas...<br>  SALU2|`|1izfSI07aa	si a mi asi me pasa, pero trata de hacerlo entender que es bebeficio de los dos|`|2GjqsQRvaa	bueno amor yo particularmente no me sentiria mal por que mi pareja gane mas que yo eso es tipico de un hombre machista que no haceptan que la mujer habeces es mas preparada que el hombre|`|30bffa9423849985db0bb9b703bcfe33aa	Bueno la verdad eso tiene mucho que ver con las tradiciones, costumbres que el hombre ha ido creando durante la historia, es un estereotipo donde el hombre siempre debe ser el que mas aporte economicamente a la casa, el sostén del hogar, mas aun en el mundo latino, donde que la mujer gane mas dinero que el hombre es como una se?al de debilidad para este, y eso que estamos viviendo en el siglo 21, pero la verdad pensamos muchos como si aun estuviéramos en el sigo 10 que tontería, que importa realmente quien trae el dinero a casa, o quien cocina, limpia o lava la ropa, que importa quien se ocupa de la educción y cuidado de los hijos, lo importante es que se amen y quieran hacer las cosas juntos y bien, que se respeten y que los dos hagan lo que esta correcto. pero la verdad es que las cosas no son así y cuando el hombre sabe que la mujer gana mas dinero las cosas empiezan a ponerse mal, y generalmente la relación termina por romperse, si es que ya es una relación establecida, o nunca cuaja si es que están empezando a conocerse. Que le vamos a ha hacer los hombres como genero aun tenemos mucho que crecer y que aprender, somos muy jóvenes e inmaduros.|`|5BSB5zMVaa	xq n la sociedad siempre han puesto al hombre como el proovedor.. el fuert.. el macho... y cuando una mujer x cuestiones "equiz" tiene d alguna forma mas poder q el hombre este sient su hombria lastimada... es algo q la sociedad ha impuesto dsd siempre.. pero n realidad no es asi.. la hombria del hombre no c mide x cuanto gane cuantas mujeres o hijos tenga.. o x los bigotes....|`|GBnP5Tnwaa	porque a veces la mujer no asimila bien ese detalle. y  cree que porque gana mas y aporta mas, tiene derecho a no rendir cuentas y hacer lo q se le vanga en gana. por eso casi siempre fracasan en sus matrimonioos. aunque aca un monton de gente diga otra cosa solo para parecer poco machistas.|`|QFDIATegaa	Es un pensamiento machista, tanto el hombre como la mujer son seres humanos que bien por capacidad o por tipo de trabajo cualquiera de los 2 puede ganar mas.<br>  personalmante si mi esposa fuera Jennifer Aniston estaría mas que contento.|`|TgmxL8axaa	esto tiene mucho q ver con el machismo d tu pareja ya q eso no lo hace ver los beneficios q pueden tener ambos, lo único q piensa es q tú eres mejor q él|`|WUDTuEvPaa	No todos los hombres son así. Los hay que sí y los hay que no.

Aunque gracias a Dios eso esta cambiando y las mujeres somos igual de capaces que ellos, en todo o en casi todo, en el tema de fuerza bruta ellos tienen de momento las de ganar, aunque más vale ma?a que fuerza...<br>  Y gracias a estos cambios que están habiendo, también tendrán que aceptar que las nóminas de muchas mujeres sea mayor que las de ellos...<br>  Por que eso de que la mujer en casa y con los ni?os, pasó a la historia o sea que el machismo, con su orgullo y esa manera de pensar tan poco evolutiva también la tendrán que pasar a la historia para así poder seguir evolucionando los dos sexos por igual...|`|wSyEsDJYaa	Machismo e inmadurez.

Te cuento que en mi pasada relacion el ganaba menos que yo, vivia en mi casa, usaba mi coche o sea yo pagandolo todo,porque jamas me ayudo con una factura. Lo hice con mucho gusto porque lo adoraba. El se sentia bastante acomplejado con eso de que yo tuviera mejor trabajo, mayor ingresos y mas educacion, me da pena decirlo pero se sentia inferior en todo, que paso que demostraba lo macho que era montandome peleas, emborrachandose, y tratandome mal.

Con el tiempo ellos entenderán que no tienes nada de malo que la mujer gane mas o en dado caso al revez todo es para el mismo fin el bienestar de los miembros de la familia.|`|OfqOLfVRaa	Sí, ciertamente algunos hombres simplemente no aceptan que su pareja gane más.  No es tanto, que sea machista, sino que el hombre ha sido el que lleva el peso de los gastos.  Ahora, esto ha ido cambiando, con la liberación femenina.  La mujer también ayuda con los gastos, tú lo ves como una ayuda, ellos (algunos) lo ven como que "no haces lo suficiente y yo te tengo que ayudar".  <br>  Si la mujer gana más, entonces ellos pueden sentirse peor, porque lo ven como una competencia y no como una ayuda.  <br>  Si tu pareja es así, ténle paciencia, es cuestión de adaptarse al cambio, así como antes no se aceptaba el voto de la mujer, ahora ya es visto como normal. <br>  Yo tuve unos meses que ganaba más que mi esposo y él lo aceptó.   Saludos.|`|Pcj542IDaa	Parece que no te haz dado cuenta pero los hombres somos orgullosos y si nuestra pareja gana mas dinero que nosotros, creemos que no somos "el hombre" de la casa.

Quieren sentirse que son mejores en todo cuando la verdad entre una pareja no debe haber competencia.  Al contrario, si ese fuera el caso el hombre debería sentirse orgullo de que no tiene como pegoste una tonta que no pueda dar un tajo ni en defensa propia.

No es cuestión de machismo, es cuestión de generar dolor de cabeza. Cuando , literalmente, vive a costa de su marido, bien calladita que se está. Es así, simplemente.|`|xVioLYEmaa	TODO VIENE DESDE MUCHO TIEMPO ATRáS. NOSOTRAS éRAMOS LAS QUE DEBíAMOS QUEDARNOS EN CASA PARA "ATENDERLOS".

When I met my first bf at college, people didn't think it was weird at all! When I was around 15, I didn't really like any of the boys my age. They were all idiots and immature! Go with your gut feeling sweetie- believe me- no one is going to think you're weird at all...|`|0u9gguq7aa	Well right now alot of boys like me but im also shy and my mom and dad are like you arent old enough but i know that i will never go over board with a relationship so just like wait until you are ready and go for it what do you have to loose.|`|AA11879003	If your not ready then dont do it.

If you're not ready, if you don't want to then just don't. And you're not abnormal either, believe me.<br>  <br>  You have your entire life in front of you. Always follow your heart and your gut and do what is right for you.<br>  <br>  I dated at 15, but didn't get a bf as such until i was 19 (my choice and I don't regret it)<br>  <br>  Soooo, you do what is right for YOU :)|`|171d2fad1f1a5c004228f8f86a86af3caa	Mine was when I was 10 (I'm 13) and it's not abnormal or weird to get your first bf or gf in college and I don't think people would have made fun of me. I was just different.|`|8kozx14saa	I'll tell u straight huni there is no right age to have a first boyfriend! :) You're never too old. I felt exactly the same as you when I was your age. In fact I only had my first real kiss when I was 15! Before then I felt abnormal and wierd too even though I did attract a fair amount of guys, I was still shy. I had my first real boyfriend when I was 15, and even then I was too young and naive to realise what was right in a relationship because my boyfriend was 18 and an idiot! I met my current boyfriend when I was 16 and we've been together for jz over a year now :) but all I did was wait. Dont by any means rush into being with anyone ok. U'll find the right guy or he'll find you if you just be yourself! That's the only kind of guy you want anyway, somebody who likes you just for you and whether you find him in college, or in University it does not mean a thing.|`|Ak7zM9IYaa	im fifteen years old, and i like this one guy. ive liked him for several years. and hes the onyl one i want to go out with. so im not really looking for guys. i was aske out several timesthis year and i said no to all of them. my friend said she wasnt ready to date yet, but then she started talking to this guy, just as a good friend, and after a while, she did start liking him. its not like yo have to rush into it, just relax and be patient. it will come. and whenever you are ready, go for it! you are in no way abnormal. its just that some girls are insecure and think they need a guy to feel good about themselves. obviously, you aren't. congrats! i wish i were more like that!|`|kVichAxPaa	12 but dating started at 14, but starting later like in college is okay. Having dates earlier tends to take up a lot of time better used for study and getting better grades. Better to get straight A's and not date.|`|mQZceBaNaa	Actually your living a more normal life than ever. Most of these people who get boyfriends or girlfriends at young ages don't most of the time work out. The best time to meet someone is in college or university, when you have a life planned, and know where your heading, and can include someone in that life. <br>  <br>  P.S. I met my fiance in University.|`|pberHIRPaa	I only had a few boyfriends, and I'm 24. Im not bad looking either, I get all shy when it comes to guys too! Just wait it out, don't ever try to find a boyfriend because everyone else has one. They are too much drama anyway!|`|rRlmwvhMaa	Your not wierd, your just have diffrent priorites which is rare in girls your age. I give you Props for not wanting to date right now.  It is not wierd to get your first BF or GF in college, sometimes its better that way. Just finish school first, then worry about boys. You'll know when the time comes to start dating.|`|rh4YGkhGaa	Is it weird to get your first bf or gf in college? It's unusual. I know someone who didn't have a boyfriend until they were 27. She was socially phobic (which is beyond shy). <br>  <br>  People make fun of people all the time for all kinds of reasons (even though they themselves are weird in certain ways). Everyone is wired differently. There is no normal. If i meet someone who seems completely normal, I get a little creeped out.|`|C1BdqqRiaa	I have been boy crazy since birth. Which is not always a good thing. You are 15 and you have your whole life to worry about boys. So if you dont feel like having a boyfriend  you are not abnormal or weird. You are just you. Just focus on what your interests are. Then when you feel you are ready you will be an even better girlfriend.

Your friendship and nice though of your would be go down the drain too.<br>  <br>  If Yes: <br>  <br>  -----> You need to prepare, never tell him direct. You can tell him a story which he is the poor guy got cheated by the wife, or some-one else story e.g. Then ask him what would he react and do if he comes across that situation? <br>  <br>  -----> People react most of the time differently from what they said. Simple b/c they don't know how hurt it is until they go through the feeling of betray and being stupid. Giving opinions is so easy but being in the battle is not the simply.<br>  <br>  -----> If I was you: I prefer give that person hints first, so he would think for himself and figure out without getting too involve just for the sake of our friendship. Once he found out, he'll know what he should do. Either leaves her or stay to make it works and it depends on him. How much he loves her and is their relationship worth a try? Whatever his decision, I shall be there when he needed me. <br>  <br>  -----> If I was you I should put more effort into my personal life after I got cheated by the ex-bf. Try to live the better life first before I enter some-one else business. I might not better than them, no-one deserve to be cheated and get hurt so is he or you. Yes!

Conoces bien a tu marido en este aspecto? <br>  <br>  En todo caso, si es vital por si acaso que estes bien enterada de lo que te esperaria si tu marido cumple con sus amenazas, y ese panorama hipotetico solo te lo pueden dar los abogados de tu pais. En algunos paises, existen law-shops donde la asesoria es gratuita y en ultima instancia el estado te concede por un precio minimo la assitencia de un abogado para el litigio en si.<br>  <br>  Si existe algun tipo de delito mas serio es necesario que con sinceridad se analize el caso para saber a qeu enfrentarse en caso de tal demanda.|`|5JeOcWEgaa	Como ya te han dicho , buscate un abogado, y platiquen con calma y tranquilidad, si tienes hijos, no hay de otra le tiene que dar su pensión, y debes que ponerte a trabajar, hoy en día la ley protege mas a la mujer ,a si que por ese lado llevas la deganar, saludos|`|77634ee1f6d157fc03242b76ef9d933faa	como dice gustavo, buscate un buen abogado. la verdad va a triunfar!! el mejor consejo es q te divorcies, por que el puede demandarte, está en sus manos destruirte o callar. no dejes pasar nada y busca ayuda profesional.|`|a22e595098f25b0dcfe8927fb9f368ceaa	vaya !!!! si que hay ayuda en esta pregunta y me da muchisimo gusto, amiguita pues mis compa?eros han hablado y te han aconsejado, pero creo que se les fue algo importante, recuerda que la mitad de todo te corresponde y si te asesoras bien mas de la mitad te podria pertenecer a ti, motivo por el cual el pedazo de cucaracha que aun tienes por marido se va a tranquilizar y va a querer arreglar todo afuera de la corte, nooooooo!!!!!!!!, el te amenazo y ahora que afronte la responsabilidad de sus actos, por favor si te habla bonito no caigas en su juego, hay un dicho en mi pais que dice, vamos a ver de que cuero salen mas correas !!!! eso quiere decir que, quisiste amenazarme ahora afrontalo hasta el final como el disque hombre que dices ser, muchisima suerte y sludos|`|n7XcOjYeaa	Asesorate ya, estas cosas sin asesoramiento pueden terminar perjudicando a quien no lo merece|`|x0NBsuH7aa	Te amenaza porque esta que tiembla de miedo, no le demuestres temor.

Hiciste muy bien en ponerle esa acta informativa. Dile que si sigue en el plan en el que esta le vas a quitar lo más que puedas y veras como pronto cambia de parecer y te firma el divorcio.

ADEMAS- tu tienes todo el derecho de estar en TU casa.  Regresa.  Si a el no le gusta, que el se vaya.  Si te llegase a levantar la mano- que lo arresten y levanta una order de proteccion.

319066c25ac4502dcdbbc0aac635202aaa	Yo tambien tengo 38 y lo que mas me gustaria es que mi mujer fuera toda una fiera en la intimidad ( ojo, no hablo solo de lo sexual, que es muy importante, sino tambien de tu profundidad como mujer integralmente) Que cada dia encontrara a una mujer con brios y con deseos de vivir. Que significara para mi un desafio cada instante. Debes retomar todo aquello que un dia hizo que tu hombre se fijara en ti.

Et ce que represente l'engagement... on peut aussi se sentir emprisonné si on s'est engagé sans avoir reellement conscience de ce qu'on faisait...<br>  <br>  Sur le long terme? le mariage ne protege pas de la separation, mais il n'empeche que les couples mariés durent plus longtemps (on n'a pas dit dans quelle condition...).<br>  <br>  L'ENORME DIFFERENCE? en cas de gros pepin! Si l'un des deux decede, ou se retrouve dans un etat de santé grave et qu'il faut decider si on tente encore de reanimer, l'autre n'est rien s'ils ne sont pas mariés! Pas de droit à la succession (sauf si passage devant notaire, mais les frais de sont les mêmes que pour un inconnu), pas son mot à dire sur le devenir de son compagnon. Si vous avez acheté une maison ensemble, ce sont les ascendants et descendants qui en heriteront (et qui s'est qui va se retrouver jeté hors de chez lui?). S'il y aurait pu avoir une pension de retraite, le survivant ne la touchera pas.<br>  <br>  Et sinon, il y a aussi les plus petits pepins: si l'un des deux doit être muté, le rapprochement de conjoint, s'il existe, ne joue pas. face à un banquier, il vaut mieux acheter en etant mariés que concubins. Administrativement, c'est moins compliqué.<br>  <br>  Enfin, il y a l'eventuelle separation. Toute la legislation mise en place autour du divorce ne joue pas. Mettons que l'un des deux ait acheté un appartement, dans lequel le couple vit. Il rembourse seul les mensualités et ne participe pas autant à la vie du menage que s'il n'avait pas eu cette maison. l'autre s'occupe de payer pour le reste du quotidien.

Esto no es solo la depresión que puede sentir alguien por una situación temporal deprimente, como la pérdida del empleo, la muerte de un ser querido, o cualquier fracaso personal. Es una enfermedad en que los pensamientos, del deprimido estan distorsionados y ve las cosas de manera muy diferente a como los demás ven el mismo asunto. Se cree que la causa de esto tiene que ver con una distorsión en la composición de los neurotrasmisores, que son las sustancias que permiten la comunicación entre las celulas cerebrales, es decir, la falta de alguna sustancia, que debería producir normalmente el organismo y no la produce. Si se trata de esto debes informarte con un especialista en salud mental, ya que el diagnostico de este tipo de desorden es bastante difícil y por lo general requiere de medicinas. El punto díficil es que quién padece este tipo de problema por lo general no está dispuesto a reconocer que padece una enfermedad.

Simply call if you want to when you want to.  (Not at 3 a.m.)  Sometimes we try to do everything so perfectly to not mess it up that we end up messing it up giving mixed signals.

Nella fase adolescenziale xò queste figure vengono un pò "accantonate" e perdono un pò d'importanza mentre ne acquistano sempre di + gli amici... a questo punto può accadere che un ragazzo, con dei genitori d'oro magari, sbandi xchè ha trovato un "amico sbagliato" e qui la colpa non è certo di chi l'ha educato fino ad allora.<br>  Tutti urlano di volere la libertà ma non si rendono conto che la libertà non è bere fino ad ubriacarsi, drogarsi, fare sesso a 14 anni o star fuori tutta la notte a combinare guai. <br>  Questo credo sia il difficile compito di chi ha a che fare con un adolescente... spiegargli cos'è la vera libertà e soprattutto insegnarli a pensare sempre con la propria testa rispettando se stessi e gli altri.

Le gars arrive, dans les 35 ans, physique plut?t moyen et négligé, mal rasé et pas très très propre. Il est 07h30, je lui propose un café vu que je suis en train d'en boire un et là, le type a un rire ironique et me regarde des pieds à la tête avant de décliner l'offre (j'ai dit que j'étais p? canon hein ? t-t)... Il s'est imaginé quoi ?!!!<br>  <br>  Mais je pense que ce genre de réactions est compris dans une tranche d'age, la même pour les hommes et les femmes, entre 18 et 40ans. Car, quand des hommes plus agés viennent à la maison pour leur travail (problème de ligne téléphonique, autre livraison de bois), il n'y a pas ce genre de réactions à la simple évocation d'une tasse de café !<br>  <br>  Du coup, je ne propose plus de café aux hommes qui ont moins de 40 ans ^^;;;;|`|QBuRMXxAaa	elles jugent aux apparences,  et les apparences sont trompeuses.<br>  <br>  concentre toi vers des filles moins pretencieuses, arrete de jouer le difficile|`|QMmm1UrYaa	vos regards vous trahissent !<br>  alors parlez aux femmes comme à vos potes et arrêtez de vouloir les impressionner ou de les faire rire !|`|YmO6q8Zwaa	d'abord toutes les femmes sont pas pareilles et chacune réagit à sa fa?on et chacune son caractère et son esprit  .....!!  comme les mecs aussi sont pas tous pareils .....!! tous dépend de gens  et comment ils parlent et ils pensent et  leurs fa?on de parler  + il s'agit aussi  de kel sujet de conversation|`|pvJJN9y8aa	parcequ'elles sont comme ?a! et qd elle veulent pas c la meme meme meme|`|sucwDDFkaa	peut être que tu sait pas parler avec nous les femme|`|znA6Yyoxaa	Tu dis : "merde sa me fais chier de courir tou le temps apres elles elles croit toujours qu'on est des porc"<br>  D'abord essaie de ne pas leur courir après ... ?a fait chien chien renifleur ... et renie - fleur.<br>  Ensuite, si tu te conduis en gentleman, une fille n'aura pas besoin de mettre de bouclier anti-malotru, ce que toi tu prends pour la grosse tête.<br>  Et pour finir, oui, les hommes ne pense qu'à ?a ... à toi de faire comprendre aux filles que tu fréquentes (ou de ta zone) que tu réfléchis AUSSI avec autre chose que ce qui est dans ton slip.<br>  <br>  Je te souhaite plein de succès dans tes relations futures avec les filles ....

Je comprends ce que vous vivez en ce moment pour être passée par là il y a bien longtemps et avec l'expérience et le recul, je vous conseille de ne pas l'appeler. Si vraiment il vous aime, c'est lui qui reviendra vers vous, je sais que c'est dure mais c'est la réalité. S'il ne vous donne pas signe d evie, c'est que vous n'étiez pas fait l'un pour l'autre. Pendant que vous êtes malheureuse, lui vit pleinement sa vie, alors pourquoi être malheureuse pour quelqu'un qui a déja tourné la page. Vous êtes jeune et la vie devant vous. Sortez, voyez du monde , pratiquez une activité, je suis sure qu'il y aura quelqu'un qui s'interessera à vous et qui vous aimera tout comme vous l'aimerez, et sachez que toutes les histoires d'amour ne finissent pas toujours par un happy end, c'est aussi cela la vie et c'est bien ces trites expériences qui forgent notre mental vous le comprendrez dans quelques années.

If you are truly his friend  you cannot sit and watch as he does this. You must tell on him immediately!!! He may be angry with you at first...but the rewards of seeing him dealing with it and him thanking you in the long run will be well worth the sacrifice you make by telling. It is a matter of life and death not like he is drinking underage with you or something. YOU MUST tell someone you know is adult enough to take control and take him to the proper people for help to kick this as well as get through his problems he has with his dad.

She would cut so bad shed have to bandage up her arm! One night she had a big blowout with her boyfriend and she lost it. I threw her in the car and she was weeping with so much intensity i thought she would jump out. long story short, I brought that b*tch to the hospital the same night! She only did it minimal times after that.<br>  But what he is doing is crying out for attention. Saying "you shouldn't do that" is not good enough. You didn't tell us how seroius his cuts are, talk to him first and tell him that you care about him and if he doesnt stop your going to get him help (thats what real friends do) TELL HIS PARENTS. and if his father is abusive talk to a counselor at school instead, you don't want to get him into more trouble... some suicidal people show signs and people dont take them seroiusly, other people just need attention and direction. He needs help regardless.

What is the point in telling some girl that she has a nice bra and to "call him?" Especially, if he knows she likes him. Dump the jerk and find someone better.

Sino tiene nada de nada, primero debes llamar a tu operador, para que te den servicio de internet y luego le  preguntas como haces para bajar las fotos a tu pc. <br>  Si ya tienes esto y no sabes como hacerlo, aqui te explico.<br>  Tienes que mandarte un mensaje multimedia a tu numero, eso significa que ya puedes trabajar con la pc.

MdJMPOdeaa	You need to talk to a rape counselor. Although he didn't complete the 'deed', your response is justified in that you know that you were going to be a victim. Women often blame themselves when a guy comes on too strong and that's NOT the truth. I urge you to talk to your parents, a teacher or pastor to find someone who is trained in talking to women who have been violated. Don't allow this to destroy how you feel about yourself. Get help!|`|Po7ORdwEaa	This guy has obviously hurt you! I was once in a relationship with a guy for the longest time he was such a jerk to me but i stayed with him. I was with this guy for almost 2 years. After I finally broke up with him he wouldn't stop calling me, it got so bad i changed my cell phone number. For a long time I didn't want anything to do with guy. I Finlay met someone, but i was still scared cause i didn't want to get hurt. We took things slow and now we've almost been together a year. Nothings wrong with you, take your time, and have fun! Things will get better. It just takes time.|`|YRsCO0Yyaa	There's nothing wrong w/you. You said he tried to rape you, you have all rights to feel the way you do. He violated you and your trust. Talk about what happened to you to someone, maybe even your boyfriend so he has a better understanding of why you left him. Hopefully by doing so you'll feel a bit of relief and learn to love again, or at least like boys again. Most importantly, you'll learn who to give yourself to, just b/c he's cute and everybodys favorite doesn't mean he's a gentleman. Your boyfriend seems to be a good candidate.|`|kDn97hCbaa	you need to find new friends.  tell your parents what happened.
da026f9e01d707cf14c898c659ec91efaa	I know exactly what you are saying. I've been there. Sadly if you truly want him back then you are going to have to tell him exactly how you feel. How you know you were wrong and you blamed him for things that your ex's have done. And how he was the best thing that ever happened to you. Tell him EVERYTHING, and that you love him and want to be with him. Then the only thing left to do is pray that he will forgive you and love you enough to give you another chance.|`|VRAJ16e5aa	Sound like you need to look at yourself and ask why do I hurt those close.

zcvs5iZMaa	Foremost, love yourself.  Love the nature of yourself, rather than 'lean' on the things your nature has caused you to do.  If you lean on the wrong that you've done, you are making issue with that...therefore, that IS your love.  You obviously have a really big heart...full of love...and yet, your love feels to be you're own worse enemy.  You see all the wrong in others because you actually care so deeply.  You must realize that what you judge to be wrong in him, is more deeply reflected in yourself.  The 'wrongs' that you see, do not imply that your own intentions are not good.  Therefore, you have to stand and rest on loving yourself, or all else will fail.  Remember, he is human also, and cares for you.  His love for you calls for him to carry you also, and when he sees you hurt, he hurts too.  Love makes the world go round, they say.  It always come back full circle.  Therefore, realize that you must love yourself, and not be critical of your own misgivings...we ALL make mistakes...you don't have to make issue at all with the wrongs you've done OR anyone else.  It's human nature to fail, but don't plant yourself in that idea.  In other words, don't go through your life climbing your mountains without your necessary gear.  Understand there is a 'bigger' picture outside of your own faults.  Don't tie yourself to the cross of your nature or you prevent yourself from not only REALLY loving, but really living also.  Remember, he's human too, and he cares.  He has loved you before and he is capable of loving you again.  That in itself, is a sure sign that he's reaching out to you.  So, to help ease his frustrations that create war in his own mind, YOUR love for him is what will set him free from that.  It begins with you.  Love yourself, and always tell yourself, that it is not foremost important that you have 'gotten' what you have gotten in life, but rather what you 'do' with it instead.  Otherwise, you chain yourself and make a cross out of love.  Love is too great to tie it to your own heart.  If it lies dormant there, you will never be able to give it to him.  <br>  <br>  I wish you the best!|`|tAcoCgLzaa	You should tell him that you realized how much he has done for you and how much you appreciate him if you already haven't.  You should ask him for an answer.  He shouldn't keep you waitin.  He either wants to be with you or he doesn't. Good Luck!!!|`|OkFsLJFEaa	If you really love this person, you have to tell him how you feel.  Ask him what it is that he needs for you to be happy together.  With that in mind, perhaps you should ask yourself why you're truly being so negative.  Are you afraid to be happy?  Do you crave drama?   You've said that you've been hurt in the past, but if you really want to be with this guy, you've gotta suck it up and let go of the past.  <br>  <br>  However, if does truly want to break up with you, accept it in a dignified manner and move on.  Use what worked and didn't work in this relationship to help you in the next one.
ZCzWzdLhaa	i think it used to happen all the time. my parents were high school sweethearts. but i think its less common now (still possible, and i think that they ARE important) because most people go to college now so unless they go to the same college, keeping the relationship can be difficult|`|SoafM4uWaa	yeah of course they do. people end up marrying their high school sweet heart all the time.|`|XOak1Ipwaa	it can happen you may go through hard times but my mom and dad met when they were 16 or 17 and they had there times he left got married then came back to her they were married about 10 years they would still be married today if she had not died of cancer but yes it is posible if you work together and you really love eachother...|`|mqzJmAYRaa	Yes, definately. As surprising as this is people do sometimes marry high school sweethearts, not just in movies but in real life. The thing is they don't always matter, but yes people do stay together after high school in some cases.|`|wX5JxwNEaa	sometimes. and sometimes even if they dont work out they might teach valuable life lessons that can be later used in life.

eEkVh5ypaa	Je pense que si tu penses que tu ne l'aimes pas reellement  tu n'es pas oblige de sortir avec elle. Il y attirance et amour. Ces deux mots peuvent se presenter sous des memes phases et peuvent meme confondre tant de gens. il se peut qu'elle t'attire et que tu as meme envie de l'avoir pour un soir (comme tu as dit)mais ce n'est pas l'amour. Ce que tu dois faire est de jauger tes sentiments pour elle et si tu eprouves toujours les memes sentiments pour elle tu peux perndre une certaine distance , pas de l'ignorer bien entendu. Ne sort surtout avec elle pour donner raison aux autres. Apres quoi tu peux le regretter!

Sauf peut être pour certains gar?ons c'est juste la peur de se retrouver seule, l'orgueil dêtre aimé de quelqu'un ou de la possessivité mal placée bien sur... Mais bon cette seconde hypothèse n'est généralement valable que si votre relation n'est pas toute neuve.<br>  Ensuite que faire?<br>  Bonne question, si votre relation est récente tu peux lui laisser du temps car après tout on n'est pas forcément amoureux d'une personne au début d'une relation et on peut tomber fou dingue d'elle par la suite donc ?a n'est pas forcément un manque d'honnêteté. Si cela ne te perturbe pas trop reste comme tu es et tu verras si plus tard ses sentiments n'ont pas changé, là quitte le car il ne t'aimera sans doute jamais et se complait juste dans une relation affective plate et rassurante. Si tu n'arrives pas à l'accepter tu peux le lui montrer en étant plus distante, comme ton coeur te le dicte dailleurs, c'est souvent dans ces moments là en plus qu'ils se rendent compte qu'ils t'aiment ou qu'ils t'aiment effectivement davantage, quand ils sentent qu'ils te perdent.<br>  J'imagine que ?a fait très mal d'entendre ?a, surtout si tu ne t'y attendais pas et si toi tu l'aimes.<br>  Enfin, si ?a te fait plus de mal que de bien de rester avec lui sachant qu'il ne t'aime pas ( encore..), quitte le, il faut que tu penses à toi car après tout comme il dit ne pas être amoureux il ne souffirait pas tant que ?a...; sinon reste avec lui, attends de voir les évolutions dans ses sentiments et surtout demande lui pourquoi alors qu'il dit ne pas t'aimer il veut absolument rester avec toi, peut être que ?a t'aiguillera!<br>  Bon courage et bonne chance!|`|4sZQYna4aa	amoureux de toi tu dit mais toi tu était amoureuse pour encore poser la question ,tu oses encore demander que faire quand tu c'est que tu va le quitter,ce que tu nous dit c'est que l'ordque tu regarde avec ton l'oeil de ton esprit tu reconnait que cela n'est pas correcte ,mais ici je tiens a dire que tu nous parle pas de lui mais de toi car d'un coté tu culpabilise de le quitter quand il te dit qu'il tient à toi et de l'autre c?té tu te dit ou je vais,je pense que tu à déjà trancher le problème et quand faites ta question ce tourner plut?t autour de pourquoi même dans les moments ou je reconnais un choix sensé pour moi j'hèsite?tu hésite pas les souvenirs veulent te rappeler les plaisirs ainsi ton choix serait injustifiès si tu regarde du c?té souvenir plaisir qu'il soit de toute nature<br>  donc résonne à chaque instant si tu accepte de passer du temps avec un homme pour ces beaux yeux ou pour son beau visage cela ne regarde que toi,mais ton coeur lui c'est ,donc je te recommande l'oeil du coeur car si tu ferme cet oeil tu aura peut être des hommes ou un homme qui te plait physiquement mais ton esprit sera en ruine ta langue pleurera la plus de ton coeur ,car le coeur c'est ici même que la vie est et l'esprit  reconnais quand à l'ame elle ne fait que suggèrer le bienou le mal ,comprend ce que je te raconte car c'est la vérité pur,et parle toujours avec ton coeur n'attend pas les moments dure pour laisser enfin ton coeur vivre ,car des gens sont ici sur lla terre avec nous,mails le coeurs c'est endormis;ls sont morts et pourtant ils sont vivants|`|6GPUuzAdaa	je pense que tt simplement ce mec voulait juste baiser, et aprè il a peur ke tu le penses, et se faire prendre pr un focu, voila, c tjrs la meilleur solution pr nous qd on avait que ca a faire, c casser en douceur tt en gerdant un bon contact avec la fille car aprè tt elle n'a rien fait de mal|`|lF4MMCW4aa	Pour moi être malhonnête c'est de se mentir à soi et aux autres.

DnxLtrcxaa	if he's really your friend, then he would understand your decision. you say he's too good of a friend, then he should be able to understand your feelings about the deal he wanted to make. all guys would be bummed out when that offer is turned down. but almost all guys would get over it somehow..sooner or later, he'll talk to you, and be friends with you. you say you have been crushing on him lately, so i think the reason why you refused his "deal" is because you liked him, and you didnt want to be friends, you wanted a real relationship with him. i think you should tell him that you kind of had a crush on him, and that's why you didnt want to be friends with benefits with him. even if he doesnt like you, you should still tell him, because you have to be truthfull to a good friend right? even though it'll change your friendship with him dramatically, he has a right to know about it, and everything happens for a reason. you have to follow your instinct on waht you should do. but that's my opinion on waht you should do.|`|AA12016584	Why would you want to?

First of all, if Christine had something to say about Nicole, she should have said it TO Nicole.  Since she told Jenn what she thought, Jenn should have kept it between herself, Christine and the 4 walls.  Instead Jenn tells you.  You told Nicole, so obviously you didn't like what was being said, or that it was being said behind her back.  If you ask me, you did Nicole a favor - what kind of friends talk trash about you behind your back?<br>  I think you should just talk to Nicole, and tell her that you didn't feel it was right that they were talking about her that way and you wanted to let her know what was up.  I think Jenn and Christine need to grow up and learn the real meaning of friendship.  You could text Nicole, tell her what you're feeling, and then tell her when she's ready to talk then she can text you or call you and you'll be there for her.|`|22eb4eb8c9c65a14d6ccce4dcb58d602aa	First of all we all make mistakes so don't be too hard on urself.

All you need to do is to just admit to everyone thta u made an honest mistake and ur sorry. Be gentle on urself and also on ur friends.

Jj56ALSJaa	For now if you really don't know the problem  let it go  and when she is done stewing she will either call you or come to you at school. It is tuff when a friend is mad. But maybe something was said and twisted around a bit?? Think back to the last time you talked before she acted like this. Think back to the last person other than her that you talked too. Would this person say something and get it messed up so she would misunderstand it? Don't lose sleep over it sweetie. She will come around if she is truly a good friend or you weren't good friends to begin with and you can move onto making new friends.It will be ok. It may hurt for a bit but then you move on.|`|AA12068079	find another best friend... this one is not worth ur effort... there are a lot of nice gals arounds so go make friends with them...|`|a2818bc7b664f7fe2519915575bfda97aa	Start hangin out wit her enemy...or better yet, her crush!|`|iCJNxhlsaa	first of all if she's you're best friend than she wouldnt be doing that and second of all you have a right to talk and i dont know why she's likes that<br>  <br>  so i'm guessing the girl that she's hanging out with has told her something bad about you possibly saying like you talk **** behind you're friends back even you didnt cause this happen to me before and now you're bff is gone<br>  <br>  i think you should time the time to talk to her and be like what's up you neve talk to me anymore|`|ceddd1bac3cbfaa04f027bb037d2bfb2aa	there is always a reason but maybe you don't want to see it.
AA10264059	Something similar happened with me...and I no longer have her as a "friend". You just have to way the pros and cons of your friendship and determine if your friendship is worth trying to save. If she values a guy(that she knows you had feelings for or dated(in my case)), then that's a really bad thing. But you need to get over the guy for sure! If they are dating and you are friends, it's going to hurt. I thought the guy seperated me and my former friend...but in reality me and my friend were going seperate ways so the guy was the last straw. So you need to think out things....make a list and see if the pros about your friendship outweigh the bad things. Hope I helped...that's what helped me in my situation.|`|8YSPwhv0aa	Evidently, they like each other and you are caught in the middle. I would just back away from both of them and count them as acquaintances and wish them well.Friends don't do repeats to hurt you. The second time she knew it would affect you. I would not hold a grudge but I would not trust her any more to be a close friend.|`|b660c3756d270b84da09073077f81249aa	Since she broke up with him because she saw it hurt your feelings, was nice, I guess. <br>  It's really not that big of a deal. You won't even remember this in a couple of years!|`|c65abae5807ab5348fea5514103191deaa	id be mad, just tell her that you dont appreciate what she is doing... if her apology is sicere, be friends with her again... just be careful with trusting her again|`|1dbd1c155d6ea087d8935ce063a2b675aa	well obviously neither one of them know what friendship means, I would let both of them go and move on...you guys are so young and feelings at this age get hurt alot.|`|F7RGNMwcaa	this has happened to me i think about 7 times. it sucks. but trust me, both of you will so get over this so much faster than you could ever imagine. don't ever let a guy come between you and your friends. and let her go out with him (it's not liek it's going to last. and i bet he''l end up being a total idiot and yor friend will have wished she never dated him)|`|b6b9a07612224308d6b44553335d784caa	I would ask her why she would do such a thing to me. I would  tell her that it really hurt me for her to do that.<br>  Maybe this boy didn't ask you out because you can't date and since you were unavailable he asked Mel out.<br>  Mel probably still wants to be your friend because she told this guy no at the end.|`|cq3TRuSFaa	Its pretty much already the end of the year and I think you should just let ur friend get with him.<br>  If you dont want her to... then its not like he'd ask you out cuz he likes Mel..<br>  and the year is ending.. 7th grade is coming which means a chance for new boys to come.. yum.<br>  <br>  So just let them be and move on.<br>  6th grade.. you're young.. the oh soo young drama.. lol|`|fb980253971f873d3c314b602330b5dbaa	Maybe, Mel lied to you when she said that Jesse liked you from the start. They're maybe foolin around by making you believe in to their lies. <br>  You should avoid them like they died. You should'nt be calling them as friends because they didn't treat you as one.|`|80da970cc3a9f8b7647fb67c81b0b55daa	Back off and let them be together. They like each other and you are not allowed to date. You are way to young to be so posessive. Tell your friend it's ok to date the boy and stay friends with her. If he likes you, he can break up with her and date you when you are a senior in high school and if not, you won't be known as the witch that kept your two friends from dating when they could have. They may wonder what they missed and blame it on you down the road.|`|Es8C3Hfpaa	Dont be so selfish. what can you if the really like your friend and not you. as a true friend, you be happy for her.

YOU MIGHT EVEN GET YOUR FIRST KISS!<br>  O YEAH! IF YA LIKE MY ANSWER, PLZ SELECT ME AS BEST ANSWER!
AA11852577	no, man.. if he just used her  that means he didnt like her. go for it! it doesnt make u a bad friend at ALL!|`|c5ec0014eaccadd1063404da7009e9a4aa	well, your friend is a d*ck....ask her out IF you have feelings for her.|`|7e6e7ba048c9e3579cd6ae06ddd01dbbaa	u should only ask her out if u have absolutly not doubt that he still has feelings for her, other wise u would hurt ur relationship with ur friend|`|AA12254888	just go ahead and ask her out but be careful, since she was already played by your bestfriend maybe she is seeking for revenge...|`|n90UzLuuaa	It's a good thing that you asked your friend if he minded-which he doesn't.  So if she likes you and you like her back, then I say go for it! :)
znYqRgyCaa	Be for real, tell him how you feel.  Anything less than that would be phony.|`|dQTu1Egmaa	stop answering the phone when he calls, most people have caller id these days.|`|kRvtK7Lgaa	Plant a long deep passionate kiss on him and if that doesn't work just tell him you are a racist, which you obviously are....|`|58f2af8d88b8910dbb62db5cabcad43caa	RACIST!!!!!|`|abcbb4f331ccbd46152e943adf72178caa	you're racist.

TBmOrN7Waa	why don't you be single for a while and figure out what you really want in life?|`|ml8I5Adfaa	Gurl you have a serious problem with this guy. I have been in that situation before and it is really difficult to get out of. But the person that you are with, that you truly love, you should stay with because he has probably shown you what true love means. That other guy sounds like a big jerk and he doesn't deserve someone like you. you sound like a smart gurl who knows what you are talking about. If your bf is goes along with his plan then she isn't a true bf. but if you ask her what her opinion is, and you believe her, then go with her answer. the thing is that you have to trust everyone around you. talk to the guy you are with, tell him that you don't want to go back to the other guy. that you love the guy you are with and that you don't mean to hurt him. i think this DS guy needs some help if he is that controlling and he can hurt someone. I think that you should talk to your parents or your guidence counslor because they can show you a different side to the story and it will help you make your decision.<br>  i hope that this has helped you some what, but whatever you choose just make sure that it is the right one.|`|717ccbaa056bb1c8f06f732a81f26f7caa	hey maby you should probably try tell your new guy the truth about this sabatoge and your ex and everything never know this might just bring u 2 closer,, and at least he will know to watch his back,, cause this sounds, dangerous

SCubaKHeaa	You need to tell both of them about the other.  See if it makes a difference with either one.  Tell them this is something that happened and you didn't mean for it to happen.<br>  While one will hate you for what you say, who knows she may be the one that was waiting on something to happen for her to bow out herself.<br>  Once you have told them both, they will make the only decision that suits them.  You may loose both of them, but you may also have the one that you really love, stay with you.<br>  I would rather know if I am being loved completely than I would be just someone that used to be loved.<br>  Take the chance and if it is right, then you will know which one loves you unconditionally.<br>  It seams that your fiancee" may not be as faithful as you may think, so you may have chose the right one and don't know it.  Go with your instinct.|`|GicN1B2raa	Well, you need to really decide on what you really want. Are you sure you are not just having cold feet? You should not marry your fiance if you are not ready to make the commitment to her. But, you have been away from her and have put yourself in a bad situation. When you are in a committed realtionship, you cannot allow yourself to get close to other women. If you decide to stay with your fiance, you need to cut off all ties with this other woman before something happens that you would regret. Now, if you want to leave your fiance, you need to tell her now. It is unfair to string her along while you are no longer interested in being with her. But, the other woman may not want anything to do with you if she finds out you've had a fiance the whole time. It does not matter if nothing has happened and you are just friends. You have represented yourself as single and she may not trust you anymore if you were willing to do this to your fiance. The bottom line is that you need to decide if you want to marry your fiance. Not because you are having feelings for another, but because you do not want to marry her. Once you have made this decision, you then can move on with your engagement or be free to persue this other woman. You cannot hold flirting against your fiance, when you guilty of the same thing. Put some serious thought into your decision. You may have feelings for someone else, but you have been away from your fiance. At one point, you felt so deeply about her that you asked her to marry you. If you leave her, there is a good chance that things will not work out with the newer woman and you'll regret being foolish. If you stay with her, make sure you keep yourself out of situations like this in the future. Most cheaters did not plan on cheating, but put themselves in a situation where emotions overruled their intentions and common sense.|`|ieXaO0abaa	Some people grow apart and it seems you two have done so already.  If you dislike your fiance and feel that you can live without her, but cannot live without the other woman, then I think it's pretty clear what you need to do.  My only suggestion is to make a clean break if you have to.  Tell your fiance straight up why you don't want to marry her anymore and don't make BS excuses, because that's just making things worse.<br>  <br>  As for the new woman...you have to realize you're taking the same risks with her than you are with your fiance.  She might not even be interested in you because of your history (and don't hide it, dishonesty's horrible to have!).  If she is okay with you dumping your current fiance than it is fine, however no guarantees if she'll respect you for that.  Personally I wouldn't want to be with anyone, regardless of how much they say they love me, if they can't keep a committment that they sought out to fulfill in the first place.<br>  <br>  So your situation is very tricky, GL with your choice!|`|aPONZngkaa	It sounds like your not ready to be engaged or committed to any one woman. Do your fiancee a favor, break up with her If your going to fool around on her Instead of having your cake and eating It too. Nothing worse than a guy who cheats but lies about It and doesn't have the balls to come clean about his feelings In case It doesn't "work out" with the other chick!|`|qVMg9YRsaa	Damn.. please email me if you get out of this alive! You are in a tough situation. In so many ways I am just like the girl you fell in love with. It would be easy for me to say be with her and leave your fiance. But I'm not selfish so I'll say this:<br>  <br>  Make sure you the grass is greener on the other side. You've been with this other woman a long time. You know her, she knows you. Remind yourself of why you proposed. And also remember that you barely know this new woman. Sometimes the grass is greener, but most times it's not!!! I'd talk to them both. The new girl might not want you like that.

BUdTp2inaa	I would "try" and be his friend after he gets out.  If he gets locked back up or does something stupid, I'd draw the line at that.  Everyone deserves a bit of a second chance.  I'm not too much of a believer in 3rd, 4th, or 5th chances myself.|`|5e552ca4799fcea052ad1145ecf277d5aa	well with experience, you should know that he is going to sweet talk you the whole time he is in there, and hoping you wait for him to get out. but then it will be the same way all over again! i think if you are serious about not having anything to do with him you should talk to him and tell him you want nothing more to do with him and dont talk to him anymore. that is the only way!! good luck.|`|69f34242abc0383d705479eed25cc8f4aa	I guess be his friend|`|ATxbQFc3aa	Honestly. . . . you should suck it up and move on, even change your telephone number if you have to. I am speaking from experience, well kinda. You see my dad is in jail and has been on and off for about 18years (i'm know 20). Recently he was released and contacted me at first i didn't want to talk to him because all the things he put me thru but I eventually gave in and talked to him. Now three months later he's back in jail and I was heartbroken, but the best thing to do is just forget about the guy. The only thing he will do to you is bring you down hence you are the company you keep. So hold your head up and just ignore him. Hope that is good advice for you. Good luck.|`|Y09cJhBXaa	Yes, as he will need someone to talk with about his horrifying experiences in jail.  You see, a couple of the big bad inmates made him their "girlfriend.

AA10673237	You two are at a reasonable age, and you've been together for a year, and it will probably be another year before you actually marry.  I don't think it's too soon to propose.  You are also respectful to ask her father's permission to marry her.  <br>  <br>  Make the proposal so very special and memorable. People will all be asking how you had proposed to her, so  she'll be repeating the proposal events for the rest of her life.  If you can, also try to have it videotaped and/or photographed.|`|AA12357988	I think its really sweet that you want to ask her Dad.  If you can, set up a time where you two can go out to dinner, out for a drink, or out for coffee.  If it's absolutely impossible, do it over the phone.  I think he will have a lot more respect for you if you make the effort to see him in person, though (unless he lives excessively far away, do your best to do it face to face).  There is no such thing as "too soon" to propose, the only requirement is that you are ready, which it sounds like you are.  Propose before she leaves, and start wedding planning when she gets back.  You don't have to start wedding planning right away, if you need to finish off a semester of school, it won't be a problem, because the sentiment is still there.  Congratulations, and blessings!|`|AA10925759	Don't couch it in the fact that she is leaving so you are worried. That makes it seem that is the only reason you are asking. Not that you are willing to wait because if you get engaged that is a given. Visualize that it WILL happen. That you wish to be with her because of her.<br>  <br>  You have a bit of time right? Well if you have not already just kind of bring it up in a way. Just feel her out because you probably know what she is going to say. She probably knows that you are going to ask........ or has already given it tons of thought. She may be hoping you will ask.<br>  <br>  And no it is not too soon. Too many people have all of these artificial times lines. When both parties finish degrees is a very usual time to ask. <br>  <br>  And ask her first and then work on speaking to her father. It will go much better that way. And if she says yes the women will find a way for the two of you speak. <br>  <br>  Or you could ask her there. Roundtrips off the east coast can be had for under $400. West coast for $150 more. But whatever you do first RELAX. And after some thought SIEZE THE DAY AND JUST ASK HER!|`|9e2130ec276925af9eb23573fa721694aa	A year is about the right time to propose. Why wait longer if you both feel comfortable with the idea? I'm not sure what your purpose is in asking the parents. Are you going to put your plans on hold if they don't want you to propose? Do you really want to give them this much power over your decision? If you are planning to respect their opinion, then play it safe and ask them before you buy the ring. But if you feel that, regardless of how they might feel, you two want to go ahead and get engaged anyway - then there's no point in asking. Just get a ring, propose, and happily inform the parents.|`|aEnpMsyaaa	I think you should ask her, but ask her father first.  If her mom is there too when you speak with her dad, even better.   Before buying a ring, buy her a Claddah ring at a jewelry store.  Look up the meaning of the Claddah ring on the internet.  She may want to go to the jewelry store to pick out her own engagement ring.  You can explain that it is something you two would want to do together.|`|e8a6a69e7810d75f6f141201be0b5a6daa	Buy the ring.  Talk to Mom and Dad.  & ask her when she graduates ;-)|`|308ded20b78dec984319128af94d3485aa	My husband proposed on our 1 year dating anniversary.  We were married four months later.  One year is not too soon.  If you're sure, go for it.<br>  <br>  I believe my husband asked my father before he bought the ring.  As for finding a moment alone with him, I was in the living room talking to my mom when he asked my dad.  They were in the computer room down the hall.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|69b0193d84557fa297350e9678ba47d4aa	Its sounds wonderful.  yes, go for it.  My mom and dad knew each other only two weeks before they got married and their marriage lasted until he passed.<br>  <br>  Love is love, never put a boundary or time limit on it.  You need to see her parents quick!<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|AA11642013	I would say a year is fine to get engaged and then be engaged for a year before getting married. I think it would be great for you guys to get engaged before she leaves overseas. One thing though, if her parents are conservative it would probably be a very nice gesture to ask for their permission before popping the question to her. I'm sure they would take it as very mature and think highly of you for doing it.|`|FZR9KUGBaa	When you know it is right, you just know it.  Don't wait, go and talk to her Dad today.  Make it happen, stake out his office what ever.  My Fiance proposed to me 1 year to the day that we started dating.  I loved it.  Ask her.|`|JKSR4f3vaa	DO IT!!! A year is plenty of time to know if you can spend the rest of your lives together.  I've been dating my fiance for almost 10 months now and we got engaged about a month and a half ago.  We knew right away that we were meant for each other and that we wanted to spend our lives together.  I really don't think there is a set time for dating before you should ask.|`|THNIfmkCaa	I'd say go for it. If she is worried about leaving this might help make the relationship feel more secure for the both of you. I think you have the perfect situation because you both seem ready and interested in getting married. Go for it !|`|dd1V0CfJaa	If you love her and know that you dont want to spend your life with anyone else, then I think that you should go for it..... A year is long enough to find out if a relationship can stand to go to the next level. I married my husband after 1 year of dating and I have never been happier in my life. In addition, our lifestyles have improved because we work well together and are supportive of one another.|`|fec37a46d6b0b500c56caf150814b001aa	If you feel for her as much as you seem to, propose before she goes. it will be sentimental (and they are less likely to hit on her over there if she has the ring...). After she gets back, give her time to plan...|`|lEbeRQ8Jaa	Why are you asking us? You know exactly what you want & clearly she does too. I say ask her & her dad ofcourse, but maybe change up the proposal & surprise her w/ it so she won't be anticipating it as much. 1 yr isn't too soon at  all I assure you. Best of luck!

zWq3cdKXaa	hmm... tough question. :P haha j/k. well, pollo, i say yea she does like u, @ least i think so, and im her best friend. u should become her bf cuz u were meant 4 each other!!! just like me and "charlie!" lol j/k. but  yea i think u 2 should go out, cuz u LUV her. and i would know, im ur best friend. but yea anyways thats my opinion. plus, if u guys DO go out, we can all go 2 the movies. itll be a sort-of double-date. and if u add my sis, its a triple-date. ok well ill stop talking now. hope i helped u pollo.<br>   -desi|`|NunRPQkuaa	sure if u like her plus girls HATE to be tricked in their love life
G7dvZtAZaa	What a classic answer. He's awesome...|`|4ffbd1621a74f97c7ab756510af4b2a9aa	it means mind you own business.|`|Ux8Mcq1naa	It sounds like he COULD like you, otherwise he'd have no problem in telling you what his tastes are. But he could have a dirty little secret...lol. <3|`|XnP1Rrs3aa	well i think the boy like you and didnt know how to say that|`|cNDpkEORaa	well if this "guy" is nice.... he prolly likes a girl who is his type with out knowing thats what he's looking for...<br>  He prolly didn't tell you what type of girl he likes because he thought u may like him, but he wants to like a girl for who they are<br>  <br>  I hope that made sence
ElHyqPcraa	well he did kiss you..<br>  but maybe he said no and i don't know because he's shy. i know a lot of guys who lie about their feelings for girls although its obvious they like them. how old are you two?|`|bf945140e4bccc5493ac3daa0b7b0ad8aa	wait he wants to go out with u, but not to let u know through ur friend. so keep ur fingers cross. when he comes asking it going to be a very big surprise.|`|7JaHg7M0aa	Sweetheart, guys can be complicated beings. Not all, but most would rather cease the moment, regardless of the consequences. Thank your guardian angel that you just kissed... As for what I would do if I were you;... since the answer to your friend's question was,"I DON'T KNOW",I would wait for the guy to show some advance(say an invitation to go out)...Only then would I ask if there is any meaning to what we have...The most important thing is to let him know how you feel.Until then,keep yourself to yourself.|`|8QtSG9SQaa	It sounds like your guy is a liar, and likes you, but doesn't want to make it so obvious.|`|bmPl45ycaa	well i had kinda the same problem cuz i ask matt desimone last year he said maybe and then this i ask ihm out again he said maybe we will be friends and move on then like someone came to me that matt desimone said no we were like really good friends and next u know he disnt want to be my friend <br>  <br>  anwway guys r hard to read one day they act nice and the another day they r act mean u know its so weird|`|cNDpkEORaa	he's prolly shy, i would wait to  get to know him, and become good friends before asking him out again, lol....(not the funny, humor lol) but i would give it time before u figure out if he likes you!!! :)|`|ch3cKuSzaa	Welll.. Personally, if he kissed you and then said he didn't like you it kind of sounds like he's using you. I know that sounds harsh, but it's true. If a guy who doesn't like you kisses you, it sounds like he just wants some action. He doesn't deserve you if he just wants to get in your pants. A true guy would get to know you, like you, and date you before he kissed you. That's just how I see it.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|q5rRFgWlaa	He may like you, he might just be nervous to let you know. Ive been through this same thing and so has my friend. They play it off like they dont like you either because they are nervous or they  are playin hard to get. My advice is to go for it, try to make plans for u guys to hangout or something. Whats the worst that can happen? Him not want to be with you? so what theres plenty of men out there. You would find another one in NO time!
987ac937da64e471b02aeb2a933b1585aa	Aside from everyone you said, your friend needs help! There are issues going on with her that you and her other friends can't help with. She is making these choices about the guys she dates because of her self image and how she is treated by family. Do you know that girls/women often are attracted to men (or women in the lesbian community) who remind them of either a mom or dad and the way that person has treated them? It isn't a conscious decision; it just happens. I suggest that your friend talk to the school counselor if she's really that upset. If need be, they can help her get professional help, and help her to talk to her parents about the way she is feeling. Bottom line, she will continue to show self-destructive behavior until someone interferes, sees her problems for what they are, and attempts to help her. Of course, the first step to recovery is to admit there is a problem. If she can't do that, then no one can help her. She has to want to help herself. <br>  <br>  About your friendship with her; I suggest you ask yourself one question. It is a terrific way of determing who is a good friend. When you leave her company or get off the phone with her, ask yourself, "How do I feel right now?". If your answer is "I feel good!" or any other variant,  then she is probably a good friend; but if your answer is "I feel bad about myself, depressed, etc.", maybe you should cut ties with her and move on.  You have to look out for yourself, first and foremost, after all.|`|4ef8df56ea1c6517d5c3f26de8328968aa	I don't understand how the fight started but don't apologize I mean you said you alway apologize well just watch she will apologize if you don't|`|a09428cf678527b20f210a06c622f366aa	I have a best friend who is like your best friend. I remember a time back in College when I was very concerned about her because it seems like she never seemed to try to act decent enough to get a nice guy going with her. Your friend,like my friend, exuded a personality that attracted only the 'jerks' and my friend excluded the nicer ones that could have been her lifetime mate. However good friends stand by their friends regardless. How she chose her path has nothing to do with you. Just be there for her, ready to catch her when she falls.|`|ed7ae2bed25f9f879b4cb4969dea79b5aa	No. Apologizing will keep this going. Wait for her to apologize, because as much as it hurts her, it hurts you, too. Tell her that her friendship with you should be more important than a boy, any boy, whether she loves them or not. It is important for her to understand that if she continues to get hurt, that she may look as though she wants attention. You are her friend, you can tell her that, but also, she needs to love herself before any boy. Being there for somebody can also mean knowing when to stay back some. When she realizes that she is pushing her friends away with this cycle, she will decide which is more important to her: her friends, which last a lifetime, or boys who will hurt her.<br>  <br>  Your friend sounds smart enough to realize that she is "desperate". So it won't be that difficult to get her to think more wisely. <br>  <br>  The most difficult part of helping someone is trying to not help them. Sometimes, she has to help herself. If you baby her, she will think she can do it again. <br>  <br>  If you don't apologize and do stay back some, she will wise up on her own. Trust me. It may take a little while, but she will.|`|1NSO5xwkaa	I know how aggravating it is when you watch your best friend make the same mistakes over and over again, but the only thing you can really do is be there for her.  She has to figure things out herself, nobody can make her see things clearly.  If you feel like it's getting really bad, maybe tell her parents you're worried about her....but we can't make other people change.|`|367ncR6paa	i'm only a sevvie, but i've had a bf just like that and it's a pain in the butt sometimes. you should let her know that you don't like her always taking you for granted, because one day you might not be there for her again. don't walk away, because i did and it doesn't pay, just gently give her advice on what she should do with the guys and that you really still want to be her friend, even though you don't like her attitude with you.|`|4bb4555b7d96105a7fad632c952a8f0caa	No! It is her problem! She likes guys get in her pants, let her be like that! Who cares. I know you do, but she had done it too much! So if you care DON'T appologize! She have to learn!

If he doesn't you'll end up with one broken heart and turn Scarlet red due to shear embarrassment or, in some cases, rejection. <br>  Ask his friends whether he likes different girls in your class(go down a list of girls to ask, e.g. Amanda, Laura, Magda, Phoebe etc.). <br>  If you realize he may like you,slip hints(like a cook up a nice conversation on something simple, like homework on in a class), when you walk past him or when talking to him, brush against him 'accidentally'! <br>  Further on, you need to give him a look. Hold the look for about 2 seconds,then look away. 3 seconds later repeat that step and then look at him 1 final time to see if he is looking back your way! <br>  If you're sure he likes you, you can get a friend to tell him (preferably a friend who he has known for a while) <br>  Be really nice to him and try to make something you bond over if he has a girlfriend stay away from him.. <br>  Start sitting next to him whenever you get the chance try to make something you two can bond over <br>  Act confident around him. <br>  Always believe him, unless it sounds kind of shady. <br>  Don't try too hard... no guy likes a girl over-trying or desperate. Even if you are, play it 'cool-n-casual' and act laid back. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Tips <br>  Don't always assume that a guy likes you. <br>  If you tell him you like him and he doesn't respond in a manner you were hoping for him to have responded in, make a joke of it because if you do have a huge thing for this guy, you can still be friends. <br>  Don't say "just kidding" or anything of that nature if he does not respond. <br>  Know his birthday and get him something small. <br>  Act comfortable around him!! <br>  If you`re finally going to tell him you like him, break it to him gently. Start off with something that you know/think interests him, then start dropping hints. <br>  If he doesn't get it, then maybe hes not the right one! <br>  If you don't see any signs that he does, then feel free to take that risk and just tell him, just know that it may affect the friendship he thought you two had, but at least you'll know for sure. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Warnings <br>  Don't seem obsessed with him in front of his friends (big no-no). <br>  Sometimes you'll only go out once, and without actually breaking up, the relationship will fade off... usually caused by getting constantly teased. <br>  If your friends don`t support you then they probably know something you don`t. <br>  For older men and women: most men have no trouble letting a girl know that they like them, saving you the trouble of saying it first, just make sure he knows the feeling is mutual.|`|13bc7214bebe9f20a8000b9480b7b9d7aa	get with him, it doesnt matter what anyone says just do what you feel is best... thats the best kind of beginning for a relationship, trust me, I was with a girl for 3 yrs after bein friends forever, we broke up, but we're closer now than we were before we got together.|`|20lopYxkaa	ayou would have to know the reason why you cant be together and if cant how could the person be the right one . it dosent make sense to think they are the one but never be together. your doubts will stop you so unless create a better thught you will always experience this and nothing will ever change.|`|8e3e79dd7bcb21a7b52167d5baa71371aa	I can say NO he's NOT the one and have a 99.999999999% chance of being right, considering there are over a billion other guys in the world.|`|bY4jY78Daa	i think  he likes you|`|0f12996f3fea3eb770d07926836906d8aa	My Friend has thee same problem excepted for the known him since 4th grade thing, but iam gona tell you that you have to find out where you stand before you both resent each other because your messing with each others feelings some guys don't like to express their feelings around others because then they feel weak like you have a grip on them like they have no control he may be afraid to talk about his feelings and you tryin to move on is no help to the situation because now you are confusing him if he can't deal with his feelings then rubbing some other guy in his face never helps a situation it only adds a triangle|`|8404fdd77175ebf0ca77143e31fec4a1aa	If you have to ask a public forum, I going with hell to the NO.|`|AA10322888	it depends on the person . i don't think so just move on and if u think about say to urself that he is not the 1|`|BFtJXtrzaa	I don't know how old you are but based on what you said earlier than NO I don't think he is the one.  You said you started liking other guys, just that tells me that he is not the one.  When you meet the one you will know it.  You won't need to like other guys because you will feel that he is the only one that is right for you.  You won't have any desire to even look at other guys, you will say in your mind "my man is better" .  <br>  I used to date a guy since 5th grade for many years, his sis was my best friend too, and now I think THANK GOD we are not together because he sucks!  lol<br>   <br>  And now I am happily married with someone else.<br>  You know what is funny that I didn't know that my husband is the one till after 2 month from our marriage!!

UdoyBrnuaa	There are reliable tools that can be used to create a healthy relationship, many of which have not been taught in our culture. If you want to have a really healthy relationship, follow these simple guidelines.<br>  Steps<br>  <br>     1. Do NOT expect anyone else to be responsible for your happiness. Being happy is your own job and you are the only person that can do it. Too often relationships fail because someone is unhappy and blames their partner for making them that way. The truth is that no one has the ability to make another person happy, but often we can share in another’s happiness. Make yourself happy first, and then share your happiness with your partner.<br>     2. Do not do anything for your partner if it comes with an expectation of reciprocation. The things you do for you partner must always be done because you chose to do them and you wanted to do them. Do not hold your “good deeds” over their head at a later time. Keeping score in a relationship will never work.<br>     3. Tell the unarguable truth. Many people are taught to lie to protect someone's feelings, either their own or those of their partner. Lies create disconnection in a relationship, even if your partner never finds out about it. Withholding the truth also constitutes telling a lie. Here are some examples of telling the unarguable truth: "I felt scared when I saw you talking to him at the party or at school," "I feel angry when you hang up on me," "I felt sad when you walked out during our fight and didn't want to be round me."<br>     4. Forgive one another. Forgiveness is a process of ending your anger or resentment towards another individual. It can have the power to transcend all offenses, great and small, and learning to forgive another takes patience, honesty, and respect. When sincerely given freely in a relationship, forgiveness may heal relationships that are suffering. Forgiveness is an act of humility, not one of haughty feelings.<br>     5. Make and keep clear agreements. For example, if you say you're going to meet your partner for lunch at noon, be on time, or call if you're going to be late. If you agree to have a monogamous relationship, keep that agreement and/or tell the truth about any feelings you're having about someone else before you act on them. Keeping agreements shows respect for yourself and your partner, as well as creating a sense of trust and safety.<br>     6. Be Responsible. Here's a new definition: Responsible means that you have the ability to respond. It does not mean you are to blame. There is tremendous power in claiming your creation. If you've been snippy to your partner, own up to it, and get curious about how you might do it differently next time. If you are unhappy in your relationship, get curious about how this situation is similar to others from your past, and how you might create a better relationship for yourself rather than try to change your partner.<br>     7. Approach your relationship as a learning experience. Each one has important information for you to learn. For example, do you often feel 'bossed' around in your relationship, or do you feel powerless? When a relationship is not working, there is usually a familiar way that we feel while in it. We are attracted to the partner with whom we can learn the most, and sometimes the lesson is to let go of a relationship that no longer serves us. A truly healthy relationship will consist of both partners who are interested in learning and expanding a relationship so that it continues to improve.<br>     8.<br>        Appreciate yourself and your partner. In the midst of an argument, it can be difficult to find something to appreciate. Start by generating appreciation in moments of non-stress, and that way when you need to be able to do it during a stressful conversation, it will be easier. One definition of appreciation is to be sensitively aware so you don't have to be sugar-coating anything so tell her or him you love him and that you don't want to argue but talk and make it better.<br>     9. Review your expectations. Make sure you don't try to make your partner fulfill every need in your life. One person cannot be everything to you. Everybody needs love, intimacy, affection, and affirmation, but your partner cannot alone give you all of that. You need to get some from your friends, from your family, but first and foremost, love yourself. Attempting to change someone else’s mode of processing or personality style won’t work--and will create derailments.<br>    10. Use communication to establish a common ground to understand different points of view and to create a mutual, collaborative agreement or plan. You can either choose to be right, or you can have a relationship. You can't have both. Most people argue to be "right" about something. They say "If you loved me, you would...." They argue to hear the other say "Okay, you're right." If you are generally more interested in being right, this approach will not create a healthy relationship. Having a healthy relationship means that you have your experience, and your partner has his or her experience, and you learn to love and share and learn from those experiences. <br>  <br>  <br>  Tips<br>  <br>      * The idea of “unarguable truth” is absolutely ridiculous. There is no such thing. Every single person has their own truth based on their individual experience and perception. Do not confuse truth with fact. A statement like, "I felt scared when I saw you talking to him at the party or at school," is a statement of fact not truth. If we are to be completely accurate, that is an example of a “feeling statement” which is different still. Now the impact of “feeling statements” is significant and out of the scope of this post.<br>      * The idea of always telling the truth is not necessarily a healthy one. When someone says, “Don’t you sometimes think about your ex?” it is not necessarily a good idea to answer truthfully. Yet, if you subscribe to the “unarguable truth” you would have to.<br>      * Remember what you don’t do is as important as what you do.<br>      * Strike while the iron is cold. Know when to be reflective and invoke principles. When the house is burning is no time to teach fire safety principles.<br>      * Portions of this article are based on the works of Dr. Gay and Dr. Kathlyn Hendricks.<br>      * All good relationships are based upon mutual respect. If you do not feel respect for your partner, or believe that they are losing respect for you, then consider rebuilding the respect immediately.<br>      * Communicate with your partner. Without communication, there is no relationship so try and call your partner even if it's just to say 'hi' and 'I love you'.<br>      * Avoid flirting with others, especially previous partners. Doing so may spur romantic feelings for another. There is nothing wrong with having friends of the opposite gender; just keep flirting out of the friendship.<br>      * Tell your partner how you really feel about your ex and why you're no longer romantically involved. Don't ever lie or cheat on your partner. <br>  <br>  <br>  Warnings<br>  <br>      * Keep your thoughts about the relationship realistic. Marriage should not be on your mind if you've been dating for a week, for example. Nor should you think that the relationship is going to solve all of your problems, or that you'll never be lonely again, or anything like that. Relationships can be wonderful things, but be realistic about them.<br>      * Do not assume that any one relationship will be perfect. It is human to experience disagreements and emotional pain. Working past these issues may be an ongoing struggle. <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope it helps.Good Luck!!<br>  ):-)|`|f945f18de468c2f96a1287f57cd454ebaa	It's too early to tell, after just a few weeks, if it's a relationship that you will ultimately WANT to work out.  I honestly think you need to know a person (and I mean know them really well) for at least a year before making a lifetime commitment.<br>  <br>  Second, at age 17 you've still got A LOT of growing up and changing ahead of you.  Now, you're both gonna be changing for the rest of your lives, but your changes after age 30 are gonna be a lot less dramatic.  Most people don't really figure out who they wanna be and what they wanna do until they're 30.  That said:  I got married at 21.  However, I was already a college graduate ... though it was still another decade and a half before I got a decent job.<br>  <br>  Another thing is that a baby is a LOT of responsibility.  I had my first kid at age 26 and I was NOT ready for it.  Why do you think you're gonna be ready at 17?  Some people are, but not many.  You better be ready to be a saint, because you CANNOT lose your cool with a baby in the house.  You're gonna have to keep it together, stay cool, and be more mature than 98% of adults on the planet (me included).<br>  <br>  Now, you want this to last forever?  A few tips.  I've been married 14 years.  Here's what you do:<br>  1) Listen and be interested in what she says and care about what she says.<br>  2) Don't complain.  Don't complain about your job, don't complain about your finances, don't complain about stress.  That's what your buddies are for:  your wife DOESN'T need to hear that.  She's got just as many problems and worries as you do, and she doesn't need yours.  Forget about 'sharing'.  You share joy, not trouble.  Smile a lot and put her at ease and tell here everything's fine.<br>  3) Don't ever let her forget she's beautiful.  When a wife has a baby, with a baby clinging to her constantly, all that constant touching from the baby often leaves the mom wanting to be left alone, wanting to say "Everybody stay back!  Nobody touches me and nobody gets hurt!"  You gotta just accept it and deal with it, but still tell her how much you love her and how beautiful she is, even when she seems like she's pushing you away.  Babies make moms crazy.  Deal with it.<br>  4) Get some hobbies.  You two spend too much time together, you're gonna drive each other crazy.  Let her miss you now and then.<br>  <br>  Do that, and you've got a shot, but think it through.  I don't think you know what you're in for.|`|eYiE1jtyaa	stop looking in the future and enjoy the now, enjoy the time together|`|8c0cf63bfb1d9f0af120558a242bfb9aaa	ok, you asked this earlier...and I didnt know these details!!<br>  <br>  OK!! Relize that in 7 months she will be giving birth to a baby. It will be very crappy of you to bail out near her due date. Even though you are not the father. Relize that within these next months she is going to go through major mood changes, some you may not like. Decide NOW how you are going to be involved in her life. Can you handle the changes you are about to face?|`|TmOZyiLJaa	I personally wouldn't put too much stock in the relationship.  You barely know the girl, and she's already pregnant.  Consider the cause of the pregnancy :<br>  <br>  Was she sexually abused but doesn't want abortion/adoption?<br>  <br>  Did she purposely try to get pregnant?<br>  <br>  Was she just engaged in recreational sex with a boyfriend?<br>  <br>  No matter what anyone says, you're going to do what you want to do.  Take advice from someone with experience.  Perhaps if you feel you're mature enough to handle another man's responsibility, and you absolutely feel that it's your place t step in, by all means go for it.  Please, though, consider what you're about to get yourself involved in.  Generally speaking, 17 is too young to be having a child.  Do you have a job?  Babies are very expensive, even with government aids.  Do you have a house?  You're gonna need a house to start your new family in.<br>  <br>  The list goes on.  Please think of all of the options, and don't make any hasty decisions.  Talk with a local counselor if you still need assistance, and I hope I've been of some help.|`|jOu7WtR8aa	You're 17 and about to get involved with a child, which is a huge personal and financial responsibility. Really think about whether you're ready for that, or whether it would be in the best interest of the child.<br>  <br>  In situations like this, the child is first consideration. Always. Telling a teenager that they're not the center of the universe is like talking to a wall, I know, but this is a huge realization you need to make.|`|j2Xs6risaa	I think that you should just keep caring for her or what ever but whatch out boy, im telling you this from experience. you better whatch out for her baby daddy. she pregnant by him if he wanted her back, and really tried, he most likely can. Im not saying that she will but having a baby by someone is serious and she will have to deal with this man so whatch out
OSfz8nOpaa	maybe he's not as interested in you as you think he is. he could be playing hard to get. anyway, if he's ignoring you for some reason, let it be. don't go chaisng after him for an explanation since he didn't give you the decency of telling you why he's ignoring you. hopefully you can move on from this. just don't go chasing him. leave him be.|`|Piof28JWaa	If your dating another guy and didn't pick him thats why|`|bN51zvhzaa	he might think theres no chance, so ignoring you is the only way he can handle things.|`|64f8fd6bc7f1a79aeea68311f25c8f58aa	One of my best guy friends stopped talking to me too, I do'nt know why though.

It's too close a relationship, so you really shouldn't say anything to her regarding your feelings. Distance your feelings for her with the fact that you are related...period!<br>  <br>  If she is a third, or preferrably a fourth cousin, then it's not so bad.  You can then tell her how you're feeling, and if she's not down for it, then you need to move on. <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|tjn2Mr7daa	if she is a good person,she will not hate you.this happen to many people,believe me,i know.if you think its wrong,then try to find another girl.

I mean yeah sure you may like her, but your relation with her has not gone far enough (apparently) if you've been 'rejected' (as you put it). I'm sure you'll find someone else who has the same 'liking' feelings as you would her, this is the fish you want an may hook and keep (AKA 'the keeper'). <br>  <br>  I would suggest holding the words 'I like you' or 'love' out until she says it first! I mean...I've been in awkward situations before (lets say you and me learned the hard way).<br>  <br>  Happy Fishing!|`|bN51zvhzaa	you move on and hopefully stay friends with her. she cant control who she has feelings for.|`|f343f81ef7e5ba61783a27cf4ee37a5aaa	move on|`|fY1v870Xaa	Just move on. Its not like she is the only girl in the world. Still plenty of fishes out there.|`|wvBHWD5Naa	Accept it. move on. date other girls.  don't ever tell a girl your feelings until you know she's into you.  even then, make her beg you to tell her.  stay mysterious.|`|d769ceef50688fb8fccdd6a0aa3f0221aa	you tell her, well the only reason i'm your partner at that formal dinner was because i thought you liked me!! if she's a hateful lil brat after that, skip the dinner, let her be embarrassed by having to go at it alone.|`|AA10799113	Well, it's pointless to go any further, so just move on.  Write about it in your journal, too!  Laugh at it down the road!
5WzBHKAQaa	its not hard at all if youre really in love. when your in love, you just KNOW. there wont have to be any debate.|`|VHp086UWaa	It isn't hard to know when you are in love if you have experienced it before.  However there are some people who have their own idea of what love is.  I may feel the same way you do about someone but you may call it love and I will call it something else.  However if you are worried about being in love you complicate things.  Just go with it and you will figure out whether you are in love or it is time to go.
ev3vowTNaa	Well if she likes you and you like her go for it as far as her personality is concerned it maybe "weird" because she really doesn't know how to act around you so hang out with her and get to know her first see if you click then go from there!

If you walk, walk together, if you ride the same bus sit together.  Or if you have a friend that walks (get parents permission) and walk there!  Oh then there are the sports events you two could go to one of those, softball  whatever.  If all of that is out of the question exchange phone #s.  Then first date parents will have to at least drive you there!|`|WRLmdjXSaa	Agree to meet at the mall or at the movies. That way you can both have your parents drive you. Ask him if he would like to meet you at the movies or the mall. Or mention that you are gonna be at one of these places at a certain time this weekend.|`|ZlRgXvrCaa	Meet up at a school function like a dance or something. And I don't think you should ask him out but just let him know you are feeling him. You know....just too see if he will bite the bait.|`|cr64xK4Kaa	I wouldn't ask him flat out to be your boyfriend. this will most likely scare him away.<br>  <br>  As for places to go.. i would try<br>  1- a local park for a baseball, etc game.<br>  2-Walk your dog(s) together. good exercise and good change to talk<br>  3-go to the local pool

aAeQYTuzaa	Thats an aweful thing to say about your friend there. And no she is not ugly in fact she looks very pretty to me. So what if she wants to date guys who are bit on the heavy side who are you to judge her and tell her who she can date and can't date. From what I see its you who is ugly not her. <br>  <br>  Also in some of the pictrues she does look a little down and needs a pick me up. Maybe instead of making fun of her on here or ranting on about her dating guys you don't like why not try taking her out sometime to get her hair done make-up and what not? I bet she would like that instead of just coming on her and ranting and whinning about your friend. Unless your just jealus that she can get a boyfriend?<br>  <br>  Hmm..|`|bXZattVmaa	definately she could do lots better.  her self esteen would definately improve|`|f521a6fb02e63e2c5fa2ea1ab75449a4aa	I'm not ugly and I prefer chunky guys because the ARE sweeter...they're not nearly as vain!!!

Go get them tiger!|`|FggN9BQTaa	well many guys love and even prefer "full figured women" or BBW's as the term goes these days.  You just have to find that type of person.  If you like white dudes you'll have a hard time finding a second date... if you like black dudes you'll have dates lined up.  but for the most part most guys like girls in the 5'5" - 5'8" range and in the 110 - 130 lb range.  if you dont meet this spec, chances are you'll have a hard time getting alot of dates.|`|55Ywv2mfaa	how "full figure" are you exactly, when most b*tches use this phrase they just mean fat|`|AA11966863	Full figured or fat?  Either way, yes.  There are guys attracted to all types of women.  You just have to find the right one.|`|BwzcEQcRaa	I have seen some guys(on talk shows) that won't have anything but full figured women,|`|bXZattVmaa	yes there are....we love full figured women...|`|d9c2cf5bf279cb6375ca2b96f2e8ea1eaa	I'm a full figured woman...or "BBW"....I think it all boils down to how confident you are about yourself.  If you are very self conscious, that shows in your body language.  There are men out there who love the curviness and softness of plus size women.  Good luck and have fun!!

How is this any kind of relationship at all?|`|ny2CLOz7aa	Unfortunately, having a crush on someone and actually dating them is two completely different situations. When Josh was your crush, you imagined him to be all things, perfect, fun, your soul mate. After finally going out with him, I am sorry your expectations did not meet with reality. Josh is probably a very nice guy, but not who you anticipated that he would be. It is easy to admire someone from a distance, but when being with him in actuality, he is not the guy you dreamed he would be. I am sorry that your relationship is not as you would have hoped for, but communication is vital for any relationship to survive. I think you love the Josh who you dreamed about for so long, and now, realistically, Josh is just a nice guy that you wanted to be Mr. Right|`|4RQW0qmuaa	Love is like air.

gBAYTYEHaa	The above answers are all great and clearly first hand. In my more second hand experience through the legal system working with victims, there are often signs at the beginning ( jealousy, controlling behavior) then the violence escalates, verbal, then physical.  The time period can be days, weeks or months. I cannot think of a case where it took more than a year to start except where a serious mental disorder came up or maybe a sudden problem with substance abuse|`|d3dcceb722d178a1d853b378cb280281aa	I think there are always signs, but it can start as early as any occasion makes that person feel jealous or upset.  Some men have the balls to show it early on, some wait until you are in a position that you can't easily get out of (pregnancy, marriage, location)<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|d57e29c219b565c305798b1e32e4886faa	It starts out as control issues.  One partner constantly critizising the other one, wanting the other to change.  Then they limit your ability to be with friends and family until they force you to eliminate them altogether or your friends and family back away because you're not the person they knew any longer. Once they have you under control any little issue can spark the violence.  It might start with them throwing things...then throwing things AT you, then a slap or a kick.  Physical abuse doesn't start out as physical abuse, it starts as emotional/mental/verbal abuse that is when one NEEDS to get out before it turns physical.|`|prtlYBmSaa	It's not something you can remember a 'start' time. First it was the wall, the door, throwing things when angry (probably 2 months in)... then it turns into a yelling match inches from your face (about 2 month later)... then 'bumping' into you.. and by then it's a 'protection' thing and bruises are left 4 months after that. That's the only time frame I could give you of when it turned from inatimate objects to me. It depends on the person and situation really.|`|4a14dfd051c9e1157b10bc5abd40a5faaa	It starts the moment they put their hands on you.|`|a61d29f848346a3a635d768e9c48bb90aa	it's not really like a start stop thing, it could be someone with anger problems getting pushed over the edge one day, or it could come out of nowhere, the abuser is shocked and apologizes, but it happens again the next time, it's complicated and strange and wrong but it happens differently with every relationship.

AA11597175	It depends on how you file and in which state you live. If you file no fault then depending on the state he could get half. But if you file because of the adultry (which can be hard to prove) then he may get less|`|AA10144140	I was in the same position as you.  My ex-wife was cheating on me with her boss, but the state I live in, does not care who has done what, but that the split is 50/50.  I agree 100% that what you put into a marriage is what you should get out of it.  My child support was figured on the fact that I made more than she, but she pays less for the children that live with me than I pay for the children that live with her.  Life is not fair and I have learned to live with it.  Good Luck!|`|AA12380188	I think that if your spouse cheats on you for whatever reason, that breaks the marriage contract and he or she shouldn't get anything.  <br>  <br>  Of course you are asking what we think; I don't know what the laws are concerning this in various places.|`|AcQyvgi2aa	I think if you brake your vows and cheat and get caught you should get nothing you broke a contract with another person if you didn't want to be there have enough balls to cheat have enough balls to say I don't want to be married anymore|`|facb387dab6f29678028b133ba64c423aa	No.  I think the cheater should get nothing......and forfiet all rights to all marital property.|`|gBAYTYEHaa	Legally, most states are no fault and the judges do not care who did what to whom.  This is supposed to avoid all the bad blood that came from the old days where everyone went to court and said the worst things possible about their spouse.  <br>  <br>  Morally, is a different issue. Should a cheater be rewarded?  If we consider cheating in property division, what other bad stuff should we also consider?  Should we give the cheater a chance to justify the cheating: for example is it wrong to cheat on an abusive spouse?  These things are complicated.|`|DH7Gpb4maa	No cause you would only be doing it to be spitfull and two wrongs doesn't make it right.

I notice a lot of fat chicks describe themselves that way.  And some people consider normal people skinny, while others consider really bony people to be skinny.  I guess I should put it this way:  I don't care about hair color or eye color.  I just like that normal body type, you know, not chubby and not bony either.  Good night!
bXZattVmaa	this guy is a complete idiot and how old is he??  12!!  Freaking retard.   plus he is probably making up for something....probably a small dick
VHp086UWaa	Probably so.  Shy guys have a hard time with eye contact and approaching women.  You may have to approach him and start a conversation to get things going.  It is 2007 so don't be ashamed of being a little aggressive.|`|5qgJSbocaa	Just talk to him.  What do you have to lose?  We are only human.  Maybe he is interested in you but, doesn't know how to talk to you.  As hard as it may be just go up to him and talk about ballet.
VHp086UWaa	This is an unexpected question.  The bases are 4 just like baseball.  First base is a kiss, even with tongue.  Second base is a kiss combined with a little touching usually upper body.  Third base is kissing with touching everywhere.  And a home run is when things go all the way.  I am trying not to be too descriptive so you get the idea.  <br>  <br>  Just a little extra info.  It really doesn't matter what you think the bases are when dealing with your women.  I assume you wanted to know in case you had to tell your friends.  Also you don't want to drag your lady friends name through the mud by giving bad info even accidentally.  I will say that a woman loves a man who doesn't kiss and tell.  In other words don't mess up a good thing just so the guys can think you are the man.  Let her think you are the man for protecting her name.  She will be a lot more willing to be with you and respect you if you do.|`|20ImcLhGaa	there r 4 bases|`|XNIiMw6Yaa	Five|`|7cc3893d504bd862a6a180a65e3ab1a6aa	3 bases and home plate.
VHp086UWaa	You lucky guy, I think.  Yes, women do not accidentally do those things.  I myself stay away from married women, enough single women out there so I can stay away from the love triangle.  I won't give advice(though it is hard) but I am 90% sure she is interested.|`|0791495a1c24da20e2e46984176f9bf8aa	Was your hand in your pocket when she accidental touched you???<br>  <br>  If so, it may be easier for me to answer your question.
IKFK5vQUaa	Wow that he is a jerk i i know exactly what you going through same thing happen to me but its ok just dust yourself off it may not be easy at first but you'll be able to get through. Well you can meet people any where likes clubs for example but i don't highly recommend that or school i think that's best but sometimes you got to look maybe that person you looking for is right in front of you and you don't even know it, but you sound like a cool girl you'll find someone personally i like quiet girls cause i am a little timid myself. <br>  Stay blessed|`|GW6Ie7TMaa	The first thing is believe in yourself...don't let someone make you feel like you like you are less.  Having confidence is the key to attracting someone.  Honestly, as you get older you start caring less about what other people think about you.  The key is to try and not care about what other people think.  At the end of the day, who are they to you anyway????<br>  <br>  The best way to meet someone is while doing something that interests you....team sports, clubs, etc.  At least that shows that there is a common interest.  Firstly though you need to work on your confidence otherwise you will always feel insecure (which will show).  Good Luck!|`|YOWfoYhRaa	I agree..he is a jerk! But honestly you should thank him because he wasn't right for you..you deserve better (even though I know you probably don't think that right now). If you are lacking in confidence you need time without a man to find yourself so you can be happy with who you are before you put someone else that you can attatch to that makes that void in your life.

It does't matter what it is. <br>  <br>  eg.You can walk into a totally new group, an art group, let's say, and you'll already know that everybody in that group has at least one thing in common with you. They all like art. then you'd have something to talk to them about, and before you know it you'll have a few good friends.|`|c47ca9281307f207462885cdf26f4debaa	Try going out for a club such as an acting group, local newspaper or something similar.

Women are basically used for quenching the sexual urge of the males and reproduction. Just with three Talaq a woman can be kicked out of a relation. At the same time the man can enjoy the company of more than one woman. Ridiculous system. And for all nonsense they misinterpret the holy scriptures.

J88wE7fsaa	Hmmm, since you issued the challenge I came to find this question...<br>  <br>  I don't know the answer to your question, but I could offer a couple of ideas...<br>  <br>  One is to take some of the other advice and go to church--it might not be ideal to you, but it would be a change of scenery and maybe you'd meet new people that welcome you.  Shop around for churches if you don't care for what's said at the pulpit.<br>  <br>  Another idea is to start writing--in private journal about your life up to this point.  Somewhere along the line you'll see that there is a story arc, and you are the protagonist, and when you realize how much you want this guy to succeed, you'll find your way.<br>  <br>  Maybe my answers are crazy, but you think of something really good, okay?|`|cRVgyncHaa	I think that this is a point in your life where everything is overloading.

I think that you also maysuffer from a sort of depression.

Si, 17 a?os juntos. Tenemos dos ni?os chicos, de 2 y 4 a?os.<br>  Hace seis meses el me confeso que tenia una amante desde hacia dos a?os y su amante estaba esperando una beba, solo le faltaban unos dias para que naciera!!!! <br>  Cuando me lo conto senti que mi vida se derrumbo, entre en un shock y no sabia que hacer. El estaba mas confundido que yo (te cuento esto porque te veo a ti en una situacion similar a la de el, pero sin hijos de por medio). El me pidio que queria seguir conmigo, pero me confeso que tambien la queria a ella. Yo estuve un tiempo tratando de decidir que hacer pero cuando nacio la beba lo eche de casa y el se fue con su nueva familia. Creo que no es feliz con ella, pero como que no tenia otra opcion. <br>  El me conto que habia empezado con ella porque nuestra pareja habia cambiado. Yo no me meti en una religion, pero cambie, ya no era la misma persona que el habia conocido, pues ahora tambien era madre y me dedicaba mucho a mis hijos. Por lo tanto el busco un escape y tuvo una amante. O sea, yo creo que lo tuyo tambien es un escape. Cuando mi esposo me conto las cosas que le molestaban de mi yo trate de cambiar y el se dio cuenta que me queria, pero ya era tarde.<br>  El consejo que te doy es el siguiente: lo mas probable que tu amante sea solo un escape que buscaste porque no te animaste a decirle a tu esposa las cosas que te molestaban. Quiza si le dieras la oportunidad a ella de saber lo que te molesta ella pueda cambiar y te das cuenta que la queres como antes. Trata de no mentirle mas, es muy doloroso, porque tarde o temprano se va a enterar y ella no se lo merece. Habla con ella, blanquea tu situacion y ahi te daras cuenta de lo que sientes. A tu amante no le tengo lastima pues ella sabia muy bien que tu eras casado. Aqui creo que tienes que dejar de mentir y contarle todo a tu esposa y luego hacer una terapia de pareja.

Inclinate por la que verdaderamente ames, quizás la chica que no es tu mujer te ayudo en un momento dado pero creo que es mas bien un capricho, un clavo ardiendo en un mal momento. Pero estas casado y eso no debes olvidarlo, creo que lo mejor es que hables con ella, planteale lo que echas de menos en vuestro matrimonio, debe entender que no puede imponerte sus creencias ni su forma de vida sin tenerte en cuenta. Si verdaderamente esta tan fanatizada diselo tambien, quizas deberiais ir a un consejero matrimonial o aun psicologo. Espero que te vaya bien.

Creo que una busqueda en internet arrojara consejeros de iglesias cercanas a tu casa o ciudad. El podria ayudar a traer mucha luz a como ambos estan viendo las cosas desde su punto muy personal y COMO pueden conseguir la unidad donde estan primando la separacion.<br>  <br>  Pienso que elegiste lo mas sencillo buscar alguien que te de lo que te gusta y querias, como tu esposa no te lo puede dar, o quiza en tu desesperacion por hallar algo a que aferrarte en un tiempo de inestabilidad caiste en la infidelidad. Buscar consejeria matrimonial toma mucho mas valor para los hombres pero puede salvarte de la infelicidad toda tu vida (el divorcio marca a las persona para siempre y ya no pueden volver a confiar facilmente).  Una buena consejeria, y el deseo de salvar tu matrimonio  puede restituir tu relacion con tu esposa.<br>  <br>  Yo soy evangelica, mi esposo no. Ambos vivimos en total armonia y paz. En la iglesia evangelica aprendemos cosas que los hombres valoran mucho, por ejemplo, que el hombre es la cabeza del matrimonio y le respetamos mucho y damos su lugar. El apoyo de oracion se muchos personas ha obrado maravillas en nuestro matrimonio, el poder de la oracion es inmenso y tu tambien puedes solicitarla en tu iglesia o en la iglesia a la que acudas! <br>  <br>  Tu esposa, si recien se ha convertido, esta viviendo lo que se llama su "primer amor con Jesus", y aun no sabe bien como compaginar sus creencias con las tuyas. Al cabo de un tiempo se dara cuenta de otras cosas y se esforzara por vuestra relacion. Y aunque este metida en alguna iglesia demasiado radical o fundamentalista, pienso que la oracion puede todo lo que anhelamos, si es para nuestro bien!<br>  <br>  Personas no creyentes pueden opinar todo tipo de cosas, pero pienso que en este caso el testimonio de evangelicos te servira de mucho para saber que es lo que esta pasando dentro del corazon y la mente de tu esposa.

C'est un problème plus courant qu'on ne croit... ca m'est arrive et la c'est un assez gros problème...<br>  <br>  Ya malheureuse pas 36 solutions.... <br>  <br>  -Dabords tu dois réfléchir très précisement à ce que tu veux et au effort et sacrifice que tu es prêt à faire...<br>  <br>  -Ensuite tu dois avoir un discution posé avec ta femme. Tu dois lui dire ce que tu ressents et ce que tu as besoin. Mais quand tu le fais il est important que tu ne lui fasse pas de reproche. Si tu discute avec elle c'est pour aller de l'avant pas chercher un coupable. :) et surtout tu dois lui demander et écouter ses sentiments et ses besoins.<br>  <br>  Les solutions les plus évidentes sont les suivantes, tu peux ou pas les aborder car ca doit autant te convenir qu'à ta femme.<br>  <br>  -la solution la plus saine est de consulter un sexologue et/ou un psychologue pour savoir ce qui bloque. (il ya énorment de raison possible, je n'en ferais pas la liste, ca serait inutile mais ca peut souvent se résoudre si les 2 font des efforts...)<br>  <br>  -le compromis le plus 'pratique' mais aussi le plus difficile à admettre est une entete sur une forme de libertinage... Si elle ne souhaite pas avoir des rapports plus fréquent (ce qui est comprehensible) mais que tu as besoin de rapport plus fréquent (ce qui est tout aussi compréhensible) vous pouvez décider que tu combleras tes besoins ailleurs sans le lui cacher, en échange de quoi tu ne l'harcelera pas et tu lui promettra un certain nombre de choses pour que ton couple reste stable. (ne pas découcher, lui consacrer si elle le souhaite une journée dans la semaine, toujours te protèger,...)<br>  Cette solution est à mon avis la moins bonne mais certain couple y trouve leur équilibre, alors après tout pourquoi pas...<br>  <br>  -la dernière solution évidente est la séparation.

Youre an E-5, you get E-5 pay. PERIOD.|`|xyE2NfMJaa	BAH is given if you do not live in government housing (base housing, barracks) there are two rates: with dependants and without.  If he still has children (if the yours are his as well) he should always get dependant BAH for the remainder of his service. Now the thing I don't understand is why he wouldn't live in a place of his own instead of the barracks so the kids can visit (but if they aren't his that would makes sense)?  Id say if they are his kids and either way while you are still legally married, they will first put the full dependant BAH on his LES then they will deduct what they assume he owes for living in the barracks, the rest seems to me should be yours.

This guy could be making these things up ,so he can go put with you or he is telling the truth and is being mean to his friend because he wants him to be gay with him. Think about all the possibilities and try to talk things out with both of them in the room. Trust me everthig will work out!!|`|IdjKdmi6aa	Not to be the bearer of bad news, but I would believe the friend. Because, I have been through that situation. Me being the gay one who messed around with my straight friend. We have been messin around since i was 11 til now and im 20. And my straight friend has a girlfriend who knows about us. But for some strange reason she still wants to be with him. Many men/boys, young or old experience a little bit of homosexuality. from a very young age til their senior. If he (the friend) were trying to ruin your relationship with your BF. He would have done it already.  Through manipulation or even threats of "outing" him to the rest of his family or friends. If your straight, and you've messed around with a man. You do not want anybody knowing. I know first hand because I, myself love being with a straight man rather than a gay man. And after, the straight man is scared of who might know what he had just done and if anyone will ever find out. If the friend told you that they messed around when they were younger, and have just had sex. He most likely wants you to know whats going on with your boyfriend. Instead of you finding out for yourself. Your boyfriend doesn't want you to know of the dirty deed that he participates in, maybe because he is ashamed or embarrased. What you should do is ask him again. If he says no, he is afraid to tell you the truth. But if he says yes, he is tired of hiding what he is doing behind your back and wants you to know. YOU HAVE TO ASK HIM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!! it is a danger to your own health. Many Gays are not practicing safe sex, and since its both men the risk may even be higher because of anal sex. (if unprotected). The risk of AIDs or any type of STD should not be passed onto you. You have a right to know the truth, unless you trust your boyfriend enough to believe that he has not had any sexual contact with a man at any point of his life. For the fact that its bugging you, it should. I wouldnt want to find out (if i were a woman) that my boyfriend has been having protected/unprotected sex with another man. Then finding out that I would possibly have AIDs or STDs. best of luck to you. hope I helped you in some way...

He'll have to live with the fact that he was a "jerk"|`|Wgv3psAjaa	Well, if he's the one who wanted a divorce I would proceed with caution- maybe "start over" with him by dating like you did in the beginning that way it gives you a chance to see if he's really changed. However if he abused you emotionally or physically I would say good-bye to your hubby and stay with the new guy.|`|1YI5WZoGaa	No!! Your husband had his chance while you were both together. He could have choose to work on things inside of the relationship instead of telling you he wanted a divorce and acting out for the past 6 months like he was a single man. You have involved someone elses feelings and emotions in you and if he was good enough when your husband wasn't around you will only hurt him the way you felt hurt! Your husband made his choice ...you will never know about everyone that he got intimate with through your separation and could be carrying an std that he only carrys or won't show up for years to come. Your husband knows how easy it could be to walk out of your life now and if you take him back he knows how easily you would take him back. He's a runner when things get tough and you cannot have expected him to have learned from any of his past mistakes ........without counseling and dating you again. Where did he suddenly get the guilt and knowledge from and what makes him think you are important now? He cannot come back home and think that all the six months of living single and doing what he wanted and being with any woman out there that he thinks he can be right! People divorce everyday still loving each other but it doesn't mean that you can live with them. Sometimes love is not enough. Sometimes people are in love with a dream or just addicted to one anotherand spend many years wasted before the real nightmare hits them. What would your husbands preventative measures be to not ever abandon the relationship with you in the future. What if he hooked up with someone over those months that really liked him and made it easy for him to have sex with when he wanted something different? You don't know he has been around and who may have some feelings for him. Things will never be the same because other people have entered into the relationship now. You don't fix things when sex is going from here to there and wake up one day and think your a better man for it!! This husband is far from stable and if this man you are with now has offered you more in his feelings for you....you may one day regret having given him up. People don't change overnight and without proper counseling on both your parts it will be short lived before everything comes back the same. I don't think I would take the chance after going this far and learning how to live without him. Unless you are physically and emotionally missing the stress with him more than the love. I would advise you to seek counseling first! My sources are worked in psychology and on stress unit. Good luck sweetie I hope you make the right choice for yourself.|`|M55et6t1aa	Where the hell do you get off starting a new relationship without filing for divorce?

It isn't just about you anymore. Most children are better off with both parents raising them.<br>  You didn't say if he cheated. If he cheated he needs to know that you will never tolerate that again & if he does than the marriage is over. My husband had an affair & left me for the other woman after 28 years of marriage. We tried marriage counseling before he left, but my marriage counselor told me that the marriage wouldn't work because he felt no remorse for having the affair & still wanted to see her. He was right. <br>  But I feel if your husband is truelly sorry for leaving you & still really loves you that your marriage is worth saving. You both<br>  should probably go to see a marriage counselor to see how you can improve your marriage. It is best to go to one while you haven't been married a long time. Our marriage counselor said he likes to see people when they first start having problelms & not see ones that have waited years to come & see him. He said it is usually too late by then to help them. That was the case in my marriage.<br>  You say you are involved with someone else. Do you love this <br>  other person? And if so do you love him more than your husband? I have always heard that you might as well try to work out the problems you have with your mate in your first marriage because chances are you are going to have the same problems in your second marriage & maybe even more problems from step children & exes. So it's better if you<br>  try to work on your first marriage & solve your problems. Also<br>  realize that all marriages have some problems. There is no such thing as the perfect marriage, even though some of your friends may try to make you think they don't ever fight or have any problems. It simply is not true. So try to remember that! My personal opinion would be for you to take your husband back & try to make your marriage work. Again try to go to a marriage counselor. Also get some good books on <br>  how to have a good marriage. There are tons of really good self help books out there on marriage. Go to Barnes & Noble<br>  on the internet & look up self help books on marriages. One really good one is His Needs/Her Needs & Divorce Busting.<br>  I wish you good luck & hope you try to save your marriage. You are lucky if your husband still loves you & wants to try to make it work & is willing to!!!  Good Luck!!!|`|5fxGuYR2aa	I've been the jerk before, just stay gone... your husband will change his mind again most likely cause he is indecisive. You'll know when he has made up his mind when he comes back without you being in a relationship, but don't end the new relationship unless you are not happy.|`|AA11288344	I would let him suffer some more. He can't just tell you one thing, then another later. Maybe he was messing around and is why he wanted a divorce. That didn't work so now he wants you back. I don't know. Why did he want a divorce, would probably help in answering this question. He needs to prove to you he really messed up and wants you back. He can't just say it. Don't take him back right away. You have to consider if he will or won't do it again. Good luck!!|`|KaVeua9Xaa	make him wait longer, if he truly loves you he will wait.<br>  <br>  dont throw away this new guy because of old feelings. give him a shot<br>  <br>  dont let your husband throw you away just to come back when HE wants to.|`|XzbRZCPUaa	MAYBE HE JUST WANTED TO HAVE SEX WITH OTHER PEOPLE  AND NOW HE IS DONE AND WANTS YOU BACK,  OR HE IS JELOUS OF YOUR NEW RELATIONSHIP.

Last  summer/fall things happened and I was two weeks away from leaving my  husband. He finally got his head partially out of his *** and asked me to stay to work things out. I had a hard time figuring out if I should stay or not. We had been married 6 years at that time(bought to now be 7) and I still did love him like you said you do your husband so I stayed and have been working things out and so far have been happy I have stayed. My advise is if you still truely love him try and work it out. The only way I would say not to is if cheating was involved. My case cheating was not the issue but it still did involve trust and honesty. Keep me updated if you like, I'm interested to hear what you end up doing.  the_snuggler1@yahoo on messenger or email|`|QftfjiGEaa	Think about the reason you two split up in the first place.

He hurt you in the most terrible way and now that you have moved on he wants you back. How selfish!  If he really loved you he would put your feelings first, not his. Tell him that you are still the same woman he asked for a divorce from so what has changed.  What will happen when those feelings that led him to divorce you come back. Simple, it will be you crying in the rain coz you allowed yourself to be hurt again.  Deep down in your heart you know what you want but if its going back than ask yourself if you are strong enough to go through it all again, and if he is really worth it.  For once love, be selfish. Put yourself first first, just like this so called man is.  Success and being happy is the best revenge.  Show him exactly what he lost coz now he cant have it back. You are worth more than he thinks you are.|`|ZpbZPBrUaa	only 6 months apart and you already in a different relationship that is not good .

If you went in to the marriage with a "I can always get a divorce" attitude, it was doomed from the start. The fact that you've moved on, while still married to your spouse, tends to show that you're maybe not as committed to the marriage either.

jGBCEo85aa	Before asking a girl to marry you it's a lot of things you should know. Does she look at marriage as long lasting partnership? Where does she want to live at? Does she want kids and how many? Some things like this go unanswered and can cause problems in the future. You just need to make sure you know her inside and out, even if you've only known her years it should be like you've known her forever. After all you do want to spend your life with her.|`|6a221e63714f9d33724ccb40cd162c0aaa	First of all, your future. Are you financially ready for marriage? In case you went and bought a home together? Do you think you'll ever have kids? Marriage is a huge step in life and shouldn't be taken lightly; this is who you'll spend your life with. Do you love her? Can you satisfy her and she satisfy you?

Tout le monde travaille, on vit à l'étroit, il n'y a pas assez de frères et soeurs pour faire le relai autour de la personne agée. <br>  Je ne vous cahe pas qu'en tant que marocaine et musulmane, je n'acceptais pas vraiment l'idée.

Cuando vivía en su ciudad, yo vivía solo y él con su novia, y muy seguido me iba a dormir a su casa, a un colchón o sillón. Pasó como dos veces que la novia salió y me pedía que durmiéramos juntos. Cada quien se ba?aba, ponía el aire acondicionado y dormíamos en la misma cama, con las mismas sábanas, e incluso se me abrazaba. Siempre me dijo que no lo era. Me consta que el ca.bron es mujeriego y conmigo nunca pasó nada (en el fondo, hubiera estado bien por mi parte). Lo que es cierto es que él me tenía tanta confianza, nos queríamos como amgios que somos, pero estoy seguro que nunca se lo comentó a las amistades por desconfianza a las burlas. ?Como ves?

Dormir con el mejor amigo no implica nada, si eso ha sido algo ocasional  o accidental, carece de importancia, mas si éstas escenas se vuelven repetitivas simplemente el mejor amigo se convirtió en su mejor amante. Todos nos equivocamos en nuestras apreciaciones personales porque simplemente son puntos de vista sobre algo que valoramos de manera subjetiva . Lo más importante sin demeritar a nadie solo tratando de hacer ver la realidad a quien pregunta de que debemos desde todo punto de vista enfocar bien las preguntas que no hay vacios de forma y fondo, porque de lo contrario las opiniones pueden en un momento determinado afectar a las personas en vista de que se juzga sin un juicio justo. Por lo tanto, seamos objetivos en nuestras apreciaciones y digamos con claridad si el mejor amigo el cual le conocen todos es alguien con quien yo tengo absoluta confianza y comparto hasta un dolor de muela, entonces el que duerma con el amigo, es algo normal y natural para todos aquellos que les conocen. Pero si eres nueva en el tema y apenas estás conociendo al amigo de tu amigo, dudas pueden saltar a simple vista como te ha sucedido, Por lo cual todo queda a tu buen juicio, no te vayas a equivocar porque quien conoce al amigo de tu amigo eres tu, nosotros te abrimos los ojos, no para echarte gotas sino para que tomes los mejores elementos de juicio y determines cual es la realidad de dicha relación.

I don't think you should try blowing them out with her, because it's HER wish, and HER special day. So just tell her what you think.<br>  BD|`|AA11925677	blow them out together|`|tXYyqA5daa	be a gentleman and say you want to make sure her wish comes true, so you will help her blow them out.|`|4e7ab91e7c29c43bcc67e8515e78d7b0aa	So help her out..... my work is done here.|`|7YhoMfWkaa	You and her should try practicing her blowing techniques.

Let your gf know this is your way of put yourself under control.  Also, when you find out exactly what triggers your jealousy, try to recognize that and expect it--and then it is not such a big problem.|`|wIZRRpMoaa	i hate being jealous but is normal (to a certain extent) <br>  well if theres no signs of cheating DONT WORRY <br>  if you trust her then everything should be fine. go out w/ friends, distract yourself. but dont call her often , trust is the key

S4KAcas7aa	I don't think you should be mad...annoyed, yes.  If you don't know the person, I would not put myself in a position that would seem like I was recommending her - especially if she can't keep up with the address you gave several times.  I wouldn't  worry about it anymore.  Imagine how annoyed you would be to be working with this person if they were hired.

AA11825912	I think if he's asking you out steadily for a month or so, then you should see where things are going with him. How can you get to know him if you are be-bopping from one date to the next?  There is no rule that says you have to date exclusively, but you should at least not do the double-dipping, it's not fair (just like it's not fair when they do it to women).  If he's not someone you see yourself with exclusively or long term then you've told him that and you have no reason to feel guilty.  But I would question why you are seeing him at all, what are you getting out of it?  It doesn't sound as if you like him very much so why bother?|`|By2HAU85aa	Common sense dictates that you are not a man's girlfriend until the two of you have agreed to be exclusive!|`|88a42ea4122243cd1af6d01da8540ee6aa	you sound considerate...but don't let that keep you in somethin you don't wanna be in........|`|KaVeua9Xaa	ask him how serious he is, and find out if he is still dating around....just make sure he understands that you are still talking to other people|`|VCjg00VMaa	No commitment is just that.

n'arrive pas à ma?triser et qui est en réalité une réaction biochimique du cerveau. <br>  Car quand on a aimé intensément et qui plus si on a fait des projets et qu'avec le temps s'est aussi installé l'habitude d'être avec une personne, il est quasiment impossible,  j'en ai fait l'expérience, de s'arrêter d'aimer net,<br>  <br>  sauf dans un cas qui m'est arrivé deux fois dans ma vie, c'est que le hasard a fait que à la suite de ces ruptures j'ai rencontré tout à fait par hasard un homme qui me plaisait encore plus et ma souffrance d?e au dernier s'est arrêtée en quelques heures alors que je pensais ne jamais m'en remettre. <br>  <br>  Conclusion : même si vous êtes dans le coton, prostrée par la douleur, sortez en ville, allez dans les parcs, restez assise sur un banc puis repartez à un autre endroit, ou allez dans des endroits où vous allez revoir des gens que vous ne connaissez pas, mais après les avoir vu plusieurs fois, vous ferez peut-être une rencontre, ou allez chez des amis qui ont un turn-over de nouveaux,<br>  je veux dire que  même si vous êtes mal emportez votre douleur à l'extérieur, soyez mal dehors, profitez de l'été, peut-être que quelqu'un vous verra et vous ferez une rencontre malgré vous, impossible dans votre appartement.<br>  (sur le net je ne peux pas conseiller car je suis nouvelle)<br>  <br>  mais ne vous laissez quand même pas tenter par le premier venu qui cherche une proie facile et qui voudra profiter de votre situation de détresse, restez vigilante quand même sur vos désirs, ne cédez pas à n'importe qui,<br>  <br>  et il faut savoir que dans le cerveau, les substances qui créent cette sensation d'euphorie et de dope quand on aime, finissent pas décro?tre avec le temps et si même si ?a dure longtemps, à force celà ne devient plus qu'un vague souvenir.<br>  <br>  Ainsi,  la meilleure méthode que j'ai expérimentée est le hasard (en sortant de chez soi) qui m'a envoyé quelqu'un d'autre qui a fait stopper la douleur immédiatement, dans la journée, mais c'est aléatoire, sinon  utiliser la deuxième méthode ou à défaut, laisser le temps au temps.|`|p6kXMqBjaa	oublier le et tu cherche un homme qui t'aime beaucoup tu as toute la vie

a3ee0046684928a0cb84ba5295262b45aa	Firstly, you need to realize that what you are feeling is just about normal for the situation you are in.  You aren't going nuts.  Ok, you are going nuts, but so would anyone else in your situation.<br>  <br>  When your husband returns from a long detatchment, things change.  He grew a bit, you grew a bit, but not necessarily the same way or together.   You have to fall in love all over again, and start putting the pieces back.  Naturally a few of the pieces get missed, and a few others are figured out.  This takes a bit of work. <br>  <br>  Having people close to you wandering in and out of your life is very hard.   You are getting a dose of both.  <br>  <br>  Your idea to join the AF isn't a bad one.  You will be most definitely busy.  Check on the policies about keeping spouses together, and possibly coordinating end dates.  You may also look into the civilian jobs around the base.  They don't require enlistment, but they may very well keep you quite busy.  That will help the time pass a bit, and supplement the (not exactly) huge salary that the military provides.  <br>  <br>  Talk it over with your husband, make sure it works with his plans too. The discussion and solving this problem together is going to do more for you than if you just zipped over to the recruiter and signed up.|`|UMx2Yjdhaa	Get involved with the 'spouses' club. Do volunteer work on the base. Get more involved and you'll meet more people and you won't be so depressed and lonely.|`|1LNoRxwVaa	don't join the airforce for that reason. it will only make you feel worse. try to keep in touch with your bro, he can help you out the most from the sounds of things.

xppFNm8naa	ok. first of all popular ppl are usually mean. i've chosen to be in a different crowd but thats up to YOU! but i would advise you to not get mixed up with them. your friend ashley, you say shes hanging out with mary? y do you think that is? have you been acxting differently toward her? is there something you could have done to cause that? Mary might have even offered her something to ditch you. whatever the reason, you have got to ask yourself is it really worth crying that shes not close to you anymore? If she left that easy is it really worth the trouble? you can do one of two things. you can talk to ashley face to face and ask her why she decided to hangout with mary instead of you. you can try to work things out. but make sure its just the two of you so nothing can interupt. or you might decide she isnt worth the trouble. and go hang with people who arnt artificial and pretend to be your friend. be who ever you want to be. and what ever you do, dont change who you are to be with just one friend (like ashley r even mary).<br>  i hope i could help. email me if you need clarification r something<br>  <br>  ~HaleY!|`|3LnEXEqxaa	well you should get new freinds because they are not being far|`|GtzctpP8aa	well i had a best friend who one day sudenly decided she didnt want to hang around with me n me other friends and wen to another group of friends. i was devastated at first but i have other friends who have became even closer to me... i dont have 1 bff i have a whole group...<br>  instead of realling on 1 bff who you tell everything too a whole group of really close friends mean that there bound to of either gone through what your telling them or have differnt advice than another friend will give you.<br>  <br>  when you go to your new school you tend not to stay with the same friends from your last school. its like the fresh start you want when you go back to school. <br>  <br>  forget about them...<br>  you dont just have that 1 friend surely. talk to other friends and you may have more in common then u thought...<br>  dont just have 1 best friend<br>  <br>  forget about mary<br>  shes moved on<br>  <br>  and i say forget about ashley too<br>  <br>  theyve made there decisions and now you should make new decisions with new friends. <br>  <br>  i know what being 11 feels like (im no longer 11 though) and the whole bffl and bff thing evenutally wears off and see,s pretty stupid when you become 13 and older.|`|UKRkY7DYaa	I'm sorry that your friends are being so mean to you. Girls will be girls. Pretend as if you don't care and that it don't bother you.

Good luck Sweetie.|`|ZLdyOkJhaa	exactly what i like about being a boy unfortunately i have no answer.. hang out with some boys i hang out with chicks.. theres no drama with dudes|`|d296SS51aa	ah you poor thing, you know i say never trust anybody but your own mother. girls are so rotten. the thing i say is to ask a teacher to help sort it out with you cos they are great at stopping bad girls being wicked. Your best bet is to patch things with Mary and the other one will feel so daft! Ask Mary out to shopping or something and see how it goes. I'm not a bible freak, but read psalms 27 it always put those wicked to rest and forgives you too! if you have no bible look it up on the internet. If it offends you to read a bible, make up your own little prayer, it will help trust me x|`|gqDFuZBdaa	if ur friend is being mean u should try talkin to her alone . if that doesn't work try giving her the silent treatment .|`|AA12399350	if your friend has the nerves to ditch you for someone else, she's not worth hanging around with. this ashley girl doesnt seem much of a friend. and you seem to have given enough chances to make up with both of them. no reply, huh? forget them. make some new, better friends this year. best of luck to you.|`|AXRRvt46aa	Hey that's what middle school is gonna be like.<br>  Worst year for friendships. <br>  A lot of girls who you thought were your very best friends are going to become all fake and ditch you! <br>  Be glad that you aren't following them because in the long run they won't end up as happy and succesful as you will.<br>   So, let that drama go and tell them its cool that they are friends, but too bad they ruined your guys's friendship, and tell them that as if nothing is wrong. <br>  Stand your ground and be strong thru middle school coz this will happen a lot.

Pero eso se soluciona con que le digas que no sea tan goloso y que deje para otro día. Pero tampoco creo que te los mame toda la noche. En algún momento tendrá que dormirse, como todo bebé. <br>  Pero no deberías ser tan exagerada en tu reclamo.

I was once offered money, I think it was $20,000 to go to Trinidad, and marry someones brother. (and this someone was my lover).  but the brother needed a sponsor who was born here.  then, after they get here, there are a whole pile of legal things you have to do.  joint bank accounts, joint credit cards, the same address, get the picture?  and as soon as your name goes on even one document for him, you become entirely responsible for everything.  like if he runs up a $80,000 credit card bill, you're stuck with it.  and any other little debts that he may accumulate.<br>  snub them, they're just trying to use you.

Ensuite, si cette fille n'embrasse pas ni ne fait l'amour, c'est qu'elle a assez de respect pour les mecs pour ne pas bruler les étapes. Je suis entierement d'accord avec elle sur ce point et moi aussi je refuse de sortir avec une fille (je suis un mec), par respect pour elle, car je sais que l'amour que je peux ressentir pour elle peut ne pas durer... et c'est ce qui arrive.<br>  Tout ce que je veux dire, c'est que si tu veux vraiment l'aimer, ne la résume pas à son corps, et rapproche toi d'elle en temps qu'ami, puis fiance toi puis marie toi.

Mais ce serait bien trop simple, je crois que pour avoir du sens dans sa vie il faut accepter le fait que la vie, n'a pas de sens, elle est faite pour la vivre et c'est ce qu'il faut faire.

OPjERhZVaa	okay, so first: i'm definately jealous. what you and your guy have seems really great. It seems like you really love each other and are totally open with each other. That's great; it means you have a future together. Which also means that sex can wait until you're both older. if you're not sure enough to make the decision without input, then you may regret it afterwards, and that could take a toll on your relationship. the longer you wait, and more sure you both are, the better.  and if you do wait, when it finally does happen, it'll seem all that much better :] <br>  <br>  goodluck!|`|toQ3ZSKTaa	Ask yourself this...do you think you're ready? If by chance you do get pregnant...is he..the one you say loves you going to support and love that baby. Is he willing to go out of his way to take care of both of you? Its good he's not pressuring you..he's a good man for that...but in my opinion you guys are not ready. You don't need to have sex in order to prove your love for one another...he's proved it to you already. Sex is a beautiful thing...but it shouldn't be rushed. There's plenty of time, but again...he's left the choice to you...think about it...be safe and take care.|`|958c6b8a5456d613811ee39f49a60688aa	are you christian, catholic, lutherin, morman, or any other religion  that worships God/ the Bible? if so.

You're young and you both have your whole lives ahead of you. Why spoil the relationship now, if you really love him. Things change sometimes in a relationship after you sleep together. And if he's not pressuring you then why rush things? Ultimately, only you can make the decision, but make sure you realy think about it. P.S. Pregnancy is not the only thing you have to worry about these days.<br>  Hope this helps..|`|AA12275281	i wouldn't!!!!! cause even though you guys have talked about what would happen if and when it does. it changes things a hole lot.first your life is screwed cause now you have this little person to deal with and i bet you like want to go to collage?? if not you want to finish high school.  and second if he finds another girl that he like better then you....bye bye..bye.....o and you would need a good job to help out with that....to...so i won't ......|`|EifHWMo1aa	I believe you are still very young.

EJLKnPFMaa	Mira, corazón. Yo tengo casi 36 a?os y me voy a casar con una chica de 24. La conocí cuando ella tenía 20 y yo 31. Yo era candidato a diputado y ella me apoyó en algunas cosas. La diferencia de edades sí pesa, pero pesaba mucho más entonces que ahora. En muchas cosas yo he tenido ventaja sobre ella por la diferencia de edades, y aún cuando la cuido y protejo, ella me reclama ciertas actitudes. Son ma?as que han salido con la edad. Pero al mismo tiempo sus reclamos a veces tienden a ser exagerados: su manera de compensar que llevo ventaja por la diferencia de edades es a veces reclamar de más. Eso tensa mucho la relación, y supongo que si duras con tu novio vivirás estos momentos.<br>  Y bueno, si lo que da miedo a tu mamá es que llegues a hacer el amor con él, miedo que yo tendría si fueras mi hija, ten en cuenta que a los 21 a?os lo más probable es que él ya haya tenido alguna relación. Evita estar a solas con él. Si la relación dura, esto se dará; pero si no dura más vale que eso no suceda.|`|yqIC1hAkaa	El amor no tiene edad... pero lo q pienso q ocurre en tu caso es q eres muy joven y te faltan muchas cosas por vivir, tu madre esta tratando de cuidarte para q no tengas una mala experiencia a temprana edad.

huLbLq7iaa	You need to move on. Tell her that she hurt you and you don't need that kind of friend. No one does.|`|lU61SrRSaa	she shouldnt treat you like that.you really dnt deserve that.<br>  its not your fault you have to go to another school.<br>  forget her,i kno that may be easy r me to say,but its not as hard as you think,if she asks you to go somewhere with her,refuse.if she wants you to hang out with her and her new friends,simply say no.<br>  make you some new ,true friends,you really dnt need that.|`|1nY1Ubanaa	If you are mad at what she did then you should be mad at her. Be mad at her all you want. But if she is trying to talk  to you,  you should think if you  would want to still be friends with her or not. If you don't want to just go a head and ignore her and maybe get new Friends. But if you still want to be her friend talk to her..|`|nxpIg7anaa	Just try talking to her.<br>  Like tell her about what's she's doing.<br>  And, why is it that she tries talking to you after.<br>  Tell her why you ignored her.<br>  If things don't work out,<br>  just try to make new friends.<br>  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK, :]<3|`|repKalUZaa	You need to explain to her, since she is your friend. That ignoring you hurts your feelings, and just because you go to a new school she does not have to act like this. If she does not understand, move on she was never your friend because a true friend would not at like that.
fCF7tZ4qaa	what you could do is go to the restaurant more often and then when you see him and he comes over to you, introduce yourself and try and start a conversation with him to get his attention that you are attracted to him to see if he is attracted in return...|`|e1dc61fe86e4539f88ffde7d3e99425aaa	Just try to go up to him and try having a interesting conversation.  Then you can ask him if he might like to hang out with you sometime.  Hope this helps.  Good luck!

dE0vtX2eaa	just tell her. and ask your friends mum to phone. just be extra good and say how youve never been with your friend and that they are good people and you will be in good hands. also helps to be the perfect kid for a few days/.|`|Slr6jtMGaa	not if she knows her and her family real well.....ask her...the worst she could say is no....|`|2IMCtD47aa	well it depends who your going with and how much your mom trusts you, so if you have those two things covered go ahead, ask, see what she says.:]|`|aVs1mu3laa	Not at all darl, seeing another country is an amazing life changing experience and if your mother understood that she'd be ok with it|`|VAI6MtPIaa	Does your mother know your best friends sister or parents? If not (or even if they know each other), have them talk on the phone about the holiday you would like to take. If your parents trust you as well as the sister you should be able to go.    Good luck & Have Fun!|`|5f449c637a79c3dd213f6d4bcfef22a0aa	she's your mom, go ahead and ask her  Would you send your 15 yr old when you become a mom?|`|ALvp7YRuaa	it depends if your doing good in your house and in school. just ask your and if you think she does everything and your going to pressure her then don't... or maybe ask her if she would like to come along. but take it nice and easy.byebye!|`|lGS1zOd6aa	ask a mummy?|`|oUV9ZUsEaa	no, go ahead.|`|ejJD6BBXaa	not at all u sohould ask ifif u and they r trustworthy than u should have no problem|`|GfphOIdOaa	I could imagine your mother being afraid you will cross the boundaries of safe sex during that holiday. Show her you have precautionary items like condoms with you so she will at least not have to worry you'll get pregnant or any disease.
V4mNZEvtaa	If i were you-  I would tell her to read some books, watch the news etc. Make it so she doesn't depend purely on her looks, let the guys she dates see she has more of a substance to her and she is interesting not just pretty.  I really don't mean any of that in a mean way. But guys will eventually get bored of the looks.    What you said about you comparing yourself to your sister-in-law,  i doubt your husband will care that much if you don't have 'the perfect body'. However looking after yourself (without going to fake) is a good thing. Always try to make an effort with your clothes and hair. It will also boost your self confidence if you think you look nice.  But don't try too hard if you know what i mean, be yourself and do not change your individual style for anyone else.    Hope this helps  :)|`|nr1Bt47baa	Guys get sick of the girl not the body.|`|f2b1a09b580fe9049bc28c8e845abd3aaa	Some might date "porn star look alike" but not me, sorry. I rather go for the down to earth, semi smart, and who can hold a conversation.|`|JkwsGu8vaa	Depends on if the person was genuine nd if they had a decent personality nt always about looks (Y)|`|XmD61yBpaa	Maybe she secretly wants to be a porn star|`|capCtdkeaa	looks are only skin deep, but for what its worth, I wouldnt date a woman that looked like that, all fake , snipped tucked and injected.  I personally see that as shallow, and wouldnt find it attractive, but thats only my opinion, if it makes her happy, then great|`|EvDmgWjvaa	Look a like, its attitude your talking about. We call it a high maintenance woman, always having to worry about how they look and feel they are judged by it. Don't worry, most good men and husbands know whats flash and where the real deal is at.  You had all the parts inside & out  to have your husband fall if love with you, don't confuse love with a style and how you look.|`|grAU3MJcaa	That's the kind of girl you have fun with, not the girl you take home to your mom.|`|CINdqEhzaa	well i wouldent let it bother me if she was cuddly and could hold a convo and as right for me but it could be like the man might feel there sleepin around coz they look like a porn star|`|HZuLVEEsaa	I think if your husband wishes you looked more like his siter you've got real problems.|`|lDXAA9FKaa	it could be that she has no personality, guys arent shallow the way we think they are. its probably a novelty to them at first the way she looks but if she lacks everything else but the bedroom i doubt most decent guys would stay.|`|FyhzmgRUaa	Very interesting, let me start off by saying this you're husband is a very lucky man because he has two women in his like that haven't noticed this yet, but could possibly become better friends then they already are. It sounds like the two of you could learn a lot from each other, if the two of you were to spend more time together. You wish to be somewhat more attractive towards you're husband and your sister in law can't keep a man because she's always cheated on.Perfect!, you say your sister in law has a great body, so she much go to the gym often, go with her when you have time. Your sis in law looks like a porn star you say, hmm go to the mall with her and see what she likes to buy and help her modify her look so she attracts different kinds of gentleman. It would probably be a good idea if the two of you could hang out with each other for a while and get to know each other more in depth, why not go to a spa or somewhere were the two of you can communicate on a different level, try it, because i think that you two sound like you could be real close. Hope that helped, ^_-. Chow~~.|`|0nW8wMBdaa	Maybe she's only good at looking but useless in the house. Might be seen as a useless mother. Some women are gf material and others wife material. Plus she probably sets the tone of the relationship as sex as she is quite forward, which means to a man don't change it to anything else if you get it.|`|BlZSrsrmaa	guys usually go for looks in the begining later they realise they want more and a porn star look a like isnt what you would stlle down with..  and as for your question at the end i dont think u should degrade urslef to that level but just carry urself better then u usually do [being a wife and mother and looking godd 4 the hubby is hard but if u can then do it]    x|`|Q33dbzAdaa	wow I just got hard reading that. Seriously. I'm NOT JOKING.    The way you phrased everything excited me.

AA11510999	you sound pretty freakin smart to me lol She should love it, i know i would, You dont need to add anything though i wouldnt think cause then that would be TOO much. But great idea. GO for it|`|a899c2784f7d18371c6b8f614a000c4eaa	Yeah, but one thing...    How long does it take her to go to the bathroom?    Lol, it's a great idea, but only if she's taking a shower for 20 min or something. If you can solve that, then it's a GREAT idea! Or, if it's not too expensive, you could take her out to dinner, but surprise her by taking her for one night to a nice hotel. Then, you'd be able to go there before picking her up and get everything set up. Or, the hotel itself might have something they could do to set it up. Just a suggestion.|`|yzOtKTJIaa	i think you should add something otherwise it sounds like more of a present for yourself.  Maybe give her a massage or run her a bath and add some of the petals to it or something.|`|MEr99qKraa	..it's better not to plan just let things happen..as that adds to the excitement..rather than knowing whats coming..remember plans can go wrong...i noticed the word ''hopefully'' this is what i mean if it's done off the hoof theres no space 4 ''hopefully''..in ur head it's all gonna be perfect it might be ..then again it might not be...just go with the flow as being romantic is meant to be spontaneous..u got one plan what happens if she don't respond how u expected..PLAN FAILED...U GET ME......ROMANCE IT MAYBE BUT U STILL GOTTA BE REALISTIC
bdb1fbb0a6c3f2b002837336162fe1efaa	Bom, vejamos!<br>  <br>  Eu n?o queria perder peso, pois estou satisfeito com a minha forma física. Tá bom, na verdade eu queria ficar um pouco mais forte, mas n?o tenho tempo nem dinheiro para ir à academia.<br>  Meu sonho é cursar Publicidade e Propaganda. Eu n?o consegui a troca de curso que eu tentei fazer no meio do ano, mas tentei o ProUni novamente e tirei 80, alguma coisa na prova objetiva. Estou só esperando a nota da reda??o, mas acho que tirei uma boa nota. Infelizmente, ainda n?o consegui convencer a minha família a me deixar trocar de curso, mas pretando fazer isso.<br>  N?o fiquei com ninguém esse ano, mas finalmente consegui fazer uma garota que estava a fim de mim perceber que eu n?o estava a fim dela.<br>  Eu tentei fazer o concurso da Petrobrás esse ano e tirei nota 84. Minha família toda achou que eu ficaria entre os primeiros colocados e me fizeram criar um monte de expectativas, porém, a minha coloca??o foi 232 (mais de 7000 pessoas concorreram a mesma vaga que eu) e acho que n?o serei escolhido, apesar da minha m?e ainda achar que eu vou ser chamado. E o pior de tudo é que a prova n?o estava fácil.<br>  Também n?o consegui tirar a carteira de motorista. Eu n?o fiz isso ainda por falta de dinheiro. Na verdade, eu até consegui um estágio, mas eu só fiquei trabalhando durante 2 meses, pois a empresa era pequena e teve que reduzir custos e, por isso, eu acabei sendo dispensado. <br>  <br>  O ano ainda n?o acabou e eu creio que ainda conseguirei atingir algumas metas!

Difficile de le die.<br>  Il est vrai que quand on aime on abaisse les barrières, on fait tomber les tabous, les a priori.<br>  Nous avons un exemple du mariage D’Edith PIAF avec Théo SARAPHO, plus de 30 ans d’écart……..|`|0vQq8liUaa	J'aime qu'il  soit plus agé,  il a de la maturité<br>  merci bisou|`|1b7eee614c387efedd06e69cb5a04b10aa	mon chéri est plus agé et ?a me dérrange pas car je sais qu'au moin il as la tete sur les épaules et c'est etre responsable dans les choix et décisions qu'il va prendre<br>  je suis tomber sur des plus jeunes et des plus vieux que moi et honnetement bein y a rien d'intéréssant a part qu'ils veulent s'amuser et aucune responsabilité vraiment après tout dépend de ce qu'il y a dans la tete mais l'age ne compte pas<br>  bisous a toi bonne journée|`|40313f2c200d6f137c4e7a45ea385515aa	c'est pas vraiment une histoire de preference... c'est a dire que je ne le fait pas forcement expres, mais quand je fais le bilan, mes copains ont toujours ete plus ages que moi...

Y4s4Om38aa	They are trying to involve you since you are their sister in law, and so should be like a sister........but granted they should be like sisters too you.     Sister 1......im assuming vegas is a destination wedding, and not that they live there and so are having it here?  If that is the case, destination weddings should be discussed with everyone you want to attend and planed according to everyone.......you cant just assume everyone can afford it.    Sister 2....sounds like shes being a brat and just wants to get married to have her wedding before sister 1......and you are right enough in staying out of the way of it.   If you can go, then go, but if you cant, then dont.......especially if its short notice, or far travel.   You have no obligations to helping.  If they were very sisterly to you, then it might me a bit rude not to help at least a little, but you sound like that if they were sisterly to you to begin with then you probably would anyway if you can.    You sound like you have your head in the right place.   Be nice enough to give them a card and gift, but beyond that, don't worry about them so much.....especially since your husband isnt either......would be a bit worse of a situation if he was siding with his sisters.|`|hkwBR1moaa	It would help to know who you are to these sisters.  What is your relationship.  It seems to me the whole family is being immature about what should be the happiest day of their lives.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	It sounds like you have sisters 1, 2, and 4 figured out. Sister 3 will just have to get over it. And when any of them bring it up with you in the future, trying to get you on their side, just say, "I'm really not comfortable talking about Karen/Susan/Judith/whoever behind her back like this. Can we change the subject?"    Even if they were horrible to you, you don't need to be horrible to them in return - believe me, it never makes you feel as good and righteous as you think it will. If you don't want to go to any of the weddings, just decline the invitation on the RSVP. If you choose not to send a gift, send a card. Their family might have no manners, but you can be the bigger person and model polite behavior - maybe it will rub off on one of them, or at least on their children.|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	Ha, thats kind of comical. Well, they are self-involved people and they assume that you are as interested in their lives as they are!|`|NVrLg3Bjaa	They obviously value your opinion and I can tell you since I'm planning my wedding, you need all the help you can get.  They probably feel like you just don't care about this big even in their life.|`|TiAK1629aa	You're doing the right thing not getting involved.  It can only get worse from here.  Some women are nuts when it comes to weddings, and you're right not to get involved in what seems to be a case of one-upmanship between a couple of them.      They are only trying to involve you so they'll have someone to vent to and have on their side....they got angry because you didn't get your feathers ruffled right along with them.  You didn't "agree" with them, so you're automatically going to be the enemy.    Switzerland is THE place to be.|`|4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	Stay the course, and take care of yourself and commit nothing to these people.  I find that people like those you are mentioning to be impossible to please.    Why are they trying to involve you?  Doesn't really matter, you're an adult and you chose the way you live your life.  Why are they getting angry?  Because they've learned that getting angry empowers them to get what they want from other people.  They haven't learned that being nice and helping friends/family is how a person empowers his/herself when they need help.  They don't expect from themselves what they expect from others.  Avoid these people as much as you can, otherwise, you're asking for more strife in your daily life.|`|WV36m31Zaa	cuz they are spoiled brats .. .
04hieff6aa	Estoy de acuerdo contigo, pero la realidad es que quienes deben velar por esos chicos son sus propios padres.Si ellos están buscando respuestas en un lugar como este significa que no hay una buena comunicación en sus casas, significa que cualquier cosa que les diga gente extra?a están dispuestos a aceptar como correctas.Es triste pero es la realidad que se vive hoy en día .|`|1ZI2r7WXaa	No hay que echar las culpas a nadie, eso es cosa de la personalidad de cada uno.|`|7y1PqhoPaa	Pues desde mi punto de vista.... tampoco veo q hagan algo muy malo.. tan solo se han metido en un foro donde se preguntan cosas o dudas y gente le ayuda.tampoco es una pagina porno..pa q no puedan entrar..tampoco veo mal q si el chico q era gay lo felicitaran por aceptar su orientacion sexual.... y sobre la otra chica q preguntara eso sobre el condon...a lo mejor ha buscado esto para enterarse mejor de la utilidad , porq en su casa no se atreve a sacar el tema o no se habla de eso..tan solo quieren enterarse de cosas y q le ayuden.. yo no lo veo nada malo q pregunten cosas en este foro..y q estuviera vetado para menores , no es una pagina porno... ni nada por el estilo ...pero bueno es mi punto de vista..<br>  Saludos??|`|NsTBqU1Vaa	90 % de acuerdo contigo.<br>  <br>  lo demas te lo van explicar amiga.|`|0r0wbE5maa	Primero que todo se?ora la comprendo mi hermano se acaba de suicidar, pero entienta que hay medios como este para que los jóvenes se liberen de sus preocupaciones,  temores, inquietudes, y por lo hacemos por este medio porque no hay personas en el mundo que nos brindan comprencion, no hay personas que nos quieran escuchar, no nos dan su confianza, y por eso llegamos aquí, y yo me atrevo a decir que es por culpa de los padres, ellos rompen la confianza,  no nos comprenden como jóvenes.

El caso contrario es que estuviera reprimido y fuera a ser infeliz o a cometer una locura.<br>  Al que preguntó lo del condón, felicidades. Muchos otros ni preguntan, ni consultan en ningún lugar y después sufren la consecuencias que les pueden costar hasta la vida.<br>  Me alegran que ambos hayan preguntado, seguramente salieron satisfechos, comprendidos y más seguros.

Es así, donde hay banda de mujeres, empieza el revoleo, se canjean ropa íntima erótica, perfumes, productos de higiene y belleza, revistas y videos de todo tipo, bijouterie, ropas en liquidación, marroquinerías. bonsai, sahumerios, cualquier verdura.....todas las cosas que los hombres frunci?os el ce?o con solo escucharlas.......bueno, no todo....de la lenceria erótica podemos hablar....en otra pregunta tuya.<br>  Me fui por las ramas, retomo.<br>  Nuestra amiga era hábil y vió la ocasión de su vida.

Dans ce genre de littérature, la précision historique passe au second plan par rapport à l’intention spirituelle (dans l'hagiographie) ou morale.<br>  <br>  C'est un récit fictif le plus souvent d'origine orale faisant appel au merveilleux. Une légende, à la différence d'un conte, est liée à un élément précis (lieu, objet, personnage historique, etc.) et se focalise moins sur le récit lui-même que sur l'intégration de cet élément dans le monde quotidien ou l'histoire de la communauté à laquelle la légende appartient. C'est une évolution populaire du mythe dans sa fonction fondatrice d'une culture commune. C'est le cas de la légende de la bête du Gévaudan, de la sardine qui boucha le port de Marseille ou encore des nombreuses légendes mettant en scène un pont du diable.<br>  <br>  Dans la langue courante, le mot légende est également devenu synonyme de mythe, et renvoie à quelque chose dont l'existence n'a jamais pu être prouvée (la légende des sirènes, à titre d'exemple).|`|SR9iyXcvaa	Une légende c'est quelque chose qui fait rabbit rabbit.

dw440Lylaa	What Should we tell you?    There IS no way to keep it from being a problem, you're going to be found out, you're screwing with peoples lives and emotions.  I don't need to call you names, the girl you're cheating with will destroy any chance you have with your "girlfriend", ("Hi, I'm sleeping with your boyfriend, just thought you'd like to know").  The fact that she KNOWS she's the "other woman", and hasn't dropped you like a hot rock should give you pause.............it would scare the crap out of me!!!    The longer you wait, the more pain and heartache you cause.....for everyone involved, including yourself.    Your attitude tells me you're not mature enough to be in a relationship of any kind at this point, try being single, so you don't destroy another life in the process.      Sorry.....you need help, professional therapy.    Likely the kind you're gonna get, is TWO women screaming at you.            Luck|`|hneetSf2aa	didnt you just ask this question...yes you did|`|nr1Bt47baa	Lol, you are worthless. You don't deserve either one. You are loser, a waste of air.

(you like your sauce more than the main course)    You may as well end it with this girlfriend you have.|`|VtTU4KcNaa	As you said, there's nothing we can do to stop you if you are going to keep cheating.  However, in this instance, I think you have let the affair go too far in that it has reached the point where you both are becoming attached to each other and others are starting to notice.    You could try to convince both that you want to be with both of them and they can share, but somehow, I don't think that would go over well with both of them.  As I see it, you either have to let her go (and possibly begin another affair) or let your girlfriend go.|`|MOALoKWdaa	if you want her then dump ur gf n if u dont then stop seeing her...one or the other. i know  if u dump ur gf n get with this one ur going to do the same thing to her....tough luck|`|9xgGd9praa	You're an idiot, I hope they both leave you.|`|i3pn4jNcaa	you're being greedy. from what you're saying it sounds like you have more feelings for your lover than your girlfriend. so id say pick one or the other. you wouldnt like it if you were in your girlfriends shoes so why do it to her?|`|ggBfHk1waa	It's already a problem.

You are not going to be able to hide this or lie your way out of it. The truth always comes out. The more you try to hide it or lie about it, the bigger lump of dried dog cr@p you will become.|`|QrSFskUpaa	what a good man, you represent the ideal male..not!! you disrespect your girlfriend and your other girlfriend.

How to keep the situation from becoming a problem? LOL   Too, late. It is a problem.    You will have to make a choice soon.   Before you get fired from your job, from this chick coming to your work and spying on you, and making problems  Before your friends realize your game, and someone tells your girlfriend about it,  Before the chick, gets angry about you still having a gf, and tries to hurt you.

I just found out 2 days ago that my fiance of 3 years was doing the same thing to me with my best friend.    My sympathies go out to your girlfriend, and I hope she finds out and dumps your ***.    Btw - if this is the type of life style you want to live, why be in a relationship?? Go out, have your fun, and settle down when you're actually serious about a relationship. But don't bring other people down with you (ie. your gf), cause unnecessary drama, and hurt someone that deserves a hell of a lot better than you.    I hope you realize that your girlfriend deserves a lot better.      ps -- your girlfriend WILL find out, i can guarantee that.|`|wZvbotxtaa	Wow....okay from a female point of view, we like to have our men account for every second of the days time.  You never specified if your girlfriend, not mistress, is giving you problems as well.  If she isn't then you have a relatively easy situation to handle.  the mistress knows you live with another female but isn't sure if she is a girlfriend or not so as long as you don't reveal to mistress who the roommate is you shouldn't have worries.  Keep a schedule, let work be the reason why you can or cannot meet up with her and if she cant handle it, like you said your gonna keep cheating so just find another sucker to cheat with!|`|kcqfilDUaa	Why even have an affair ? You have a girlfriend that probably loves you (Why i'll never know) ... yet you do this and risk hurting her so much after she has done nothing worng ! your an idiot !

This was the kinda **** that broke my family apart !!!|`|0cexaYDeaa	Obviously, you have to chose. Your girlfriend, or the girl your like.    It isn't fair, to your girlfriend, what you are doing, does she know what you feel for this girl, and what you think about her?    Also, does that girl know you have a girlfriend? If you consider breaking up your relationship for her, you should also realize, that this girl approves of cheating, and you shouldn't be surprised she could pull the same stunt on you.     Be honest to your girlfriend, also if you are staying with her. If her boyfriend is going around ******* other people (because yes, that is what you are doing; whether you love this other person or not) she deserves to know with what kind of person she's living with.    What comes around goes around mate, don't forget that.|`|ij4iWrUVaa	Well u are sure showing some true colors,because there is a reason ur cheating and it starts with home so u need to find out what the problem that is causeing this it might be something so simple 2 change and u are throwing ur whole life down the drain for something that could have been changed,,,,common sense if u cant find a remedy then let the other person know because has the saying goes "what comes around goes around"and i'm sure u would feel like crap being on the recieving end huh huh do un to others as you would have them do unto you just memorize that verse common sense:>|`|63e3Y7zpaa	loser..be a man|`|ae8823673c3e8e421f769986450c0cd2aa	We are hot buddy, just try to do it smartly!!!|`|KPkFwsuVaa	why do live with a girl and your with a girl if you are going to  cheat on her that makes no sense in that case you should stay single and whore around.. anyway she's Probably   cheating on you too i hope she is..you should tell the other girl staright up you have a girl that she was just for sex basically thats what it is.. and if you are going to cheat do it right duh don't keep communcating with the person un-less you want something more. After you sleep with her tell her what that really meant to you cause if not  you are giving mixed singnals..your suppose to just have sex and thats it leave not stay around and keep seeing her. Right thats how all LOSERS Cheat un-less the girl is a smut and don't care!

Meus outros filhos s?o igualmente maravilhosos n?o tenho o que me queixar de nenhum deles só que fui mais benevolente.|`|kKzxGpPKaa	ACREDITO QUE O FILHO QUE é MAIS COBRADO é AQUELE QUE DEIXAADESEJAR PARA OS PAIS, SEJA O MAIS VELHO OU O MAIS NOVO.|`|zwMj4y1Haa	Bom... Na minha opini?o sim...(sim eu sou um irm?o mais velho...)<br>  Os pais esperam mais do filho mais velho porque esperam que ele ajudará a cuidar do seu(s) irm?o(s).<br>  "Jogam" mais responsabilidades nele, mas nem todos os pais sufocam.<br>  é claro que, como irm?o, eu preciso ajudar a minha m?e e meu pai cudando dos meus irm?os mas, n?o sou responsável pelo que fazem.<br>  Meu irm?o tem 11 anos, ent?o eu tenho que orientá-lo, mas se ele vai fazer o que é certo, é outra história.<br>  O que eu quero dizer é que, obviamente, o filho mais velho é e sempre vai ser o filho mais cobrado, mas isso n?o é um aspecto t?o ruim...|`|fd61b153fd807ef15186804b2330e8c5aa	Sim, pois sou mais velha e vejo que a cobran?a de certas coisas que cobraram para mim, n?o cobram para minha irm? que é mais nova. Se fosse ao contrário, tudo seria diferente. Mas essa cobran?a fez com que eu crescesse como pessoa na vida e devido a ela sou quem sou hoje. Um orgulho para meus pais e um exemplo para minha irm? e meu irm?o (assim meu pais falam)....|`|iqfdMMcAaa	sim porque dizem que o ca?ula vai seguir o irm?o mais velho ou irm?..<br>  bjus|`|xgWdqshuaa	Com certeza filho mais velho é mais cobrado, na verdade no meu ponto de vista os pais sempre erram em alguns pontos com o primeiro filho!<br>  Esse tipo de caso é muito comum, talvez pela inseguran?a da primeira viagem!<br>  Espero ter ajudado, caso contrário...DESCULPE!|`|af9ace2e555a5cfb533ec610c2511011aa	Podes crer|`|fc675f7c9ab108af530790bb3b2532c8aa	Geralmente s?o mais cobrados, e também , mais amados.|`|1360176f32e81c68d171c58b8ea64822aa	Em casa é o do meio.<br>  Ainda bem que eu sou a ca?ula!!|`|a3811fa5d92c1fba5e27b6062fc90f6baa	Comigo é ao contrário,sou o mais novo e teoricamente sou o mais cobrado...só que ainda n?o sei o motivo...<br>  <br>  VALEU,BOA SORTE e $uce$$o$!!!!!|`|bYXbmSIJaa	Meu filho mais velho é muito calmo e independente, ent?o fica difícil opinar, porque o do meio é visado, comparado e cobrado por todo mundo, a Beatriz ainda n?o chegou, mas por ser menina provavelmente vai escapar destas compara??es que apesar de infames, acabam sempre acontecendo. Beijos !!!|`|bdb1fbb0a6c3f2b002837336162fe1efaa	Eu sou o filho mais novo e sou muito mais cobrado do que o meu irm?o mais velho.

Pero la pareja se compone al menos de dos personas. Tú también necesitas ir con un profesional.  Si bien el futuro de tu relación es incierto, es seguro que te has enganchado, de una u otra manera, a un tipo de relación que resulta nociva. Para manipular a alguien, se necesita de una persona que sea manipulada. Por alguna razón, estás en esta posición. Los juegos de pareja se juegan, al menos, entre dos. Sea que te separes o sigas con la relación, visita al psicólogo. Descubriras cosas muy interesantes que te ayudarán con tu  pareja y con la vida en general.|`|deb398e3aba0e1b295d9606a2b0ec236aa	Pues lo mejor es que vayan juntos a terapia, si se arreglan sus broncas pues que padre y si no x lo menos se separarían de una forma sana... pero si es obvio que ella necesita ayuda urgente....

No es que estubiera loca, solo q como te dije antes, el es el amor de mi vida, lo conozco desde que tenia 13 a?os  y llevo con el 11 a?os ya, realmente sin el nada tiene sentido.    Tu esposa te ama, lo q sucede es eso que tu eres una parte vital en su vida y q sin ti nada seria igual,  no la juzgues mal, tu no sabes todo lo que pasa dentro del corazon de una mujer que ama, habla con ella, dile que la apoyaras en cualquier cosa y que juntos podran salir adelante, si tu la amas no te sera dificil ayudarla y comprenderla, si aun la amas traten de salvar la relacion.  Disculpa q te haya contado todo esto, no se si te ayude o empeore la situacion, pero  cuando una mujer ama, es capaz de todo, platica con ella y espero que arreglen bien las cosas,   SUerte y que todo te salga bien,|`|X8iMg9riaa	si no hay solucion en la relacion, entonces llevala al psicologo porque se puede quitar la vida y te remordera la consiencia|`|fBblbXkXaa	no se tu, pero yo llamaria a la policia, esta ni?a no esta bien y necesita ayuda.|`|iZN1mm7Haa	definitivamente tienes que llevarla a un psicologo lo antes posible.

Creo que debes ubicarla en un centro de ayuda mental, o hacerla ver de un psiquiatra sino quiere a las buenas a las malas entonces, exigele eso , sino accede entonces ponle una demanda por amenazas quizas esto la haga reaccionar, porque su hijo corre riesgos con alguien que no tiene estabilidad mental lo cual la hace incapacitada para criarlo.

Si todo funciona y se separan dejale saber q seras su amigo, pero solo amigo no te dejes arrastar por la pena.  Cuando vuelva a decirte q se matara preguntale q si lo hace q lo contestaras a tu hijo cuando t pregunte por ella.

UO62SuR8aa	En general, yo creo que el amor lo tenemos, solo hay que saber a quien ofrecérselo, por supuesto que debe haber quimica, pero también otros factores que son más importantes, como respeto, lealtad, confianza, fidelidad y sobre todo mucho conocimiento de lo que realmente esperamos de esa persona.

lPDbAdUraa	i kinda went through the same thing with my ex. crazy thing is, we're best friends now (about a year later). see, after we broke up, we were on pretty bad terms. it ended kinda mutually and i dont think either of us really knew why, so there were just a lot of things unsettled.<br>  <br>  anyway, like a month after, his friends started telling me that he wanted to make things up with me. he asked me if i wanted to hangout and even though i was still upset i agreed. let me tell you, that hangout was the best idea we ever had. we literally talked for 5 straight hours about everything, and it ended with him apologizing and us hugging and making up. we finally had closure, that made the difference. after that, we started talking constantly and hanging out every so often, and from there just became really close. and its been that way ever since. even though he has a gf now, we still talk and hangout and have fun.<br>  <br>  i think its possible to be friends with exes but you really have to talk it all out and know what you both want out of the friendship and get over any old feelings. honestly, i think you should try to hangout with him just one time, and try to settle everything. it worked for me at least.|`|707SIy8zaa	Sounds to me like you still have feelings for each other, you just don't want to admit it.|`|9hm43HLQaa	It sounds like you still have feelings for him.  I wouldn't push the friendship.  Just go on doing your own thing and say "hi" when you see him.  Eventually when he feels comfortable enough he'll make eye-contact with you.  Just don't hold out for him thinking you're going to get back together.  I've been there before and all I did was waste my time, but now over 10 years later I am able to say "hi" when I run into him.|`|dQcjoRDkaa	Well I don't really have any advice just my story...<br>  It all depends on the reason of just breaking up.<br>  We broke up just to be friends... she hasent had a boyfriend, and i have had a girlfriend... but were still very close friends... soo... again all depends on why ya'll broke up.|`|f9485965d3d80813a2d7f83b65ff9dc5aa	He's your ex for a reason.  He's not interested in pursuing a friendship with you, so just leave it at that and move on to someone who *will* appreciate your friendship.|`|vUNLtItPaa	You should try to spend some time with him and catch up show him you would like to be friends with him. You could even go up to him and straight up tell him you miss being his friend. Sometimes being straight forward is the best. <br>  <br>  Best of luck (:  You might want to add in the details what broke you guys up. Knowing that could help.|`|23dcf2f726fbf17112409426eeac4322aa	honey you can never be friends with your ex

He might be a really nice guy.  If you really do not like him, just try and tell him in the nicest way that you can.  Good luck.

KrFaBEMfaa	So you like a guy who you don't know?  Then what do you really like about him?  His looks?  How much do you know about him?  You need to get to know him before you start trying to have a relationship with him.  For starters you could just say hi in the hall.  Also, hints don't really work for guys.  Sometimes even flat out telling them doesn't work.  The best thing to do is to walk up to him and start talking or see if you can get him involved in a group thing.  For instance, going to a sports game with a bunch of friends.|`|AtFLQxLHaa	ok think of it like this.<br>  if you dont make the first move, then nothing will happen, guaranteed. by doing that, you give yourself a 100% chance of failing. if you do make the first move, then you have a 50% chance of succeeding (he likes you too) and a 50% chance of failing (he doesnt like you). i know what your gonna say, 50-50 chance isnt so great, but its better than a 100% chance of FAILING. so make your move, cuz he probably wont !!!!!!!!!!!!|`|sVy1qQf0aa	what about you invite him to go somewhere?<br>  since your shy....<br>  ask him to go to movies with a bunch of friends, and <br>  tell him his friends are invited to <br>  or just TRY to go right up to him and say that you like him- <br>  just get it out in the open

QWSBnQcfaa	I am so sorry to hear that but you didn't think that might happen? If you or your spouse want to bring someone else into the relationship, doesn't that tell you that someone is looking for something else? You guys have made it okay to do something that is considered a deal breaker to most and unfortunately you both have to want to overcome this. Playing with fire will most likely get you burned. Live and learn.|`|05NIkjy6aa	Just hope your wife's new guy asks her for a threesome, so you can be included sometimes.|`|9YFvJ1otaa	Find out what the third did different/better, then improve your own skills/technique and blow her mind.  ;-)|`|AA11603468	I bet you were the one pushing for this to begin with.|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	Get yourself some magazines and a bottle of lotion cuz it's gonna be a long lonely ride by yourself.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	why don't you just invite over everyone you know and have a 20 people orgy?    still hungry?   go get some white castles.|`|pve5w0zGaa	that's because your relationship was not secure and strong enough in  the first place. if you're going to dabble in swinging then you must be positive that the relationship is stable. also in the future only swing as a couple, it's safer|`|S7iQ9FkGaa	A.

This is one of the risks you have to assume when you have a threesome. In reality you have three options. First option is you leave her and end the relationship. Second option is she ends meeting with the guy and the two of you work through why it happened. Third option is the two of you discuss opening up your relationship.|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	You played...now it's time to pay!|`|4Za1utmCaa	Therapy sessions and time are your best course of action.     Bottom line? A lot of couples think they can handle the emotional consequences of swinging, but only about 2% really can. I wouldn't try this again.

q1ZjPPLxaa	It's probably a product of nerves.  You're afraid that you're going to do something stupid, or embarassing, and then they won't like you back...<br>  <br>  One way that you could get over your shyness is to find a common activity that you share with the guys you like...  Maybe you're both into music, or a club in school, or something like that.  Get involved in activities that put you close to the guy in a group setting.  You'll get to know them, they'll get to know you, and then you can be more relaxed around them.<br>  <br>  Basically, most guys just want a girl to be natural around them...  Even though most girls don't believe that.<br>  <br>  If you already know the person pretty well, then you can always try just taking the big step and telling them how you really feel.

Dedicate junto a tu novio a visitar familiares, principalmente los que hace tiempo que no ves y que el te lleve a visitar los de el. Como tu dices, ahora tendras que dividirte entre las 2 familias. Ya tu novio conocera tu ambiente familiar y la forma que tienen de celebrar la Navidad y tu conoceras el de su familia. Te deseo muchas felicidades en Navidad y un lindo A?o Nuevo. Muchas felicidades en tu matrimonio.|`|RqmOPBUyaa	pos por la noche quedas con tus amigas y amigos en casa donde no hay nadie ne casa y lo pasas de pu_ta madre

I know at places like Michael's or Hobby lobby they have a lot of just photo albums that could coincide with your wedding colors or just look pretty.

I had a cousin who committed suicide 2yrs ago and at a young age....He left behind his partner and 2 kids and now those kids are going to grow up without a father....and there are questions been left unanswered as to Why he did it?<br>  There are people out there who can help you and help support you....Don't do it!!!|`|E4A43xYSaa	what happened?<br>  why you want to commit suicide?<br>  how can I help you?|`|QvxsvDKvaa	OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG DONT THINK ABOUT SUCIDE.

YOU JUST NEED TO HAVE FAITH AND PRAY! i attempted sucide two years ago and luckly i got saved..and two years later some of the best thigns have happend to me and if i owuld have died that day i would missed out on an amazing future. PLEASEE TALK TO ANYONEEEEEE DONTT DO IT!|`|zXNfrimRaa	I was in a similar situation, except I really did try to kill myself.  I ended up in the back of an ambulance, with a tube down my nose, pumping out my stomach.  It was not a fun experience.  After 72 hours in a psyche ward of a hospital, I figured out that maybe suicide wasn't the best option.  <br>  <br>  You need to understand that sometimes, life just sucks.  What is important is how you handle yourself in these times of crisis and overcoming these obstacles.  It sounds cliche, but I am serious.  If you have having these thoughts, you might want to consider calling the suicide hotline, or talking to a friend.  If possible, go to some counseling--which, despite popular belief, actually helps.  <br>  <br>  You need to stay focused on the positives in your life.  Also, does your mother know what's going on?  If not, talk to her and if necessary--get the authorities involved.  There is no reason to threaten physical harm on anyone.  <br>  <br>  Keep your head up and do what you know you have to do.  Stay strong.

7cL3ngTUaa	In general, the guys I hang out with and myself like to talk about books, games, movies, music, politics, religion, sports, and tactics (not necessarily in that order).  Start with some of those and you should be fine.<br>  <br>  When talking about books, games, movies, and music, know what genre(s) he likes and doesn't like.  It's big to a guy when a girl takes interest in what he likes.<br>  <br>  Religion and politics are hit or miss with most guys.  While my guys like to talk about that kind of stuff, I've met a LOT of guys that can't stand talking about either.  Be careful when that's how you try to start a conversation.<br>  <br>  Sports and tactics are kind of one in the same.  A lot of sports use good tactics, others...not so much.  I'll admit even though I can't stand Football like we have in the US, it uses really good tactics.  Football like I like it (Soccer) also uses thought out tactics, though they're implemented in a more life-like way where your plans will change very quickly.  Some sports don't require many if any tactics, like baseball.  I love baseball, don't get me wrong, but the only real tactics are for the pitcher to decide.<br>  <br>  What ever the guy in question likes, talk to him about that.  If he's any type of a gentleman at all, he'll ask you (sooner or later) what other things you like.<br>  <br>  Now to try and answer your second question.  I like young ladies that know who they are and have a good self-image.  Intelligence is pretty high up on my list too.  Common interests are also a big thing for me.  They have to have a good sense of humor.  I don't like it when girls flirt alot.  If they have a kind of flirty attitude and it's just their way of saying "I'm comfortable around you", then I'm OK with it.<br>  <br>  Just to let you know now though, every guy has different things they are looking for.<br>  <br>  Does that help any?|`|9ogg7fDCaa	I'm always fascinated if the girl can talk about things besides shopping, clothes, and other girlish things.|`|AA12078924	You first need to establish compatible interests like, sports, hobbies etc. This will always give a conversation point.|`|eXyMdVbQaa	Well being a guy, it'd be really easy to figure out that a girl wants to start a conversation by getting simple comments  or talking about a common interest. If it doesn't work the first time, keep at it and really soon, the male will ease up his guard and start to enjoy sharing too.<br>  <br>  personally, i look for girls who i can have an intelligent conversation with and its a thumbs up if she's funny. <br>  girls don't have to over dress up just to impress.|`|XuXTKLhLaa	i like for girls his charector, free nature, her beatiful words and structure, in sex i like girls boobs and nipples ery very much|`|eb10daf542cdec81ff789fdcf0baa873aa	chat sports|`|tbREG2Q0aa	Try politics, and cars.... maybe video games..<br>  <br>  then again they might think your the perfect girl and fall madly inlvoe..<br>  <br>  that would defeat the purpose... <br>  <br>  I wish you luck :x|`|ujpdKLKIaa	Smile, be the first to break the ice. Most guys wont start a conversation with out being prompted first. I know it kind of makes us look like we are jerks and stuck up, truth is we are mystified by the beauty of most girls and until we make the assumption if we like or not there is not much being said. Weird huh?  However if you talk us up it will take our mind off of trying to be cool and checking you out.  Hope this helps.|`|ccd7045da95b5bf8c6a850ad3b49f5ebaa	well as long as u got a vagina and u dont look to bad then if u just start a conversation guys will isten. just talk about anything the weekend tv shows. just like u are wit ur friends b like that wit guys. i love it when girls tell me regular stuff and not fake just to impress me cuz it should b the other way around. so yeah in the end just b urself.|`|Vae5z3ISaa	walk up to a guy, spread your legs and say "step right in". breaks the ice with any guy.

Siapa tahu, kita pun nanti mati meninggalkan hutang dan anak-anak kita yang melunasinya.<br>  <br>  Sebaiknya janganlah berhutang.|`|3dwkc6Qhaa	apabila orang tua sudah meningga dan meninggalkan hutangl, maka seluruh ahli warisnya berkewajiban untuk melunasi semua hutangnya. <br>  <br>  dan bagi yang memberikan hutang kepada seseorang, lalu si penghutang tadi meningga dunia, maka sebaiknya mengikhlaskan. kalau tetap menagih juga tetap sah dan boleh.|`|3EgGO4JUaa	Anda harus belajar Fiqih Islam untuk menemukan jawaban tersebut,walaupun secara gamblang akan mengatakan Wajib hukumnya membayar hutang tersebut,karena jika tidak dibayarkan,maka ruhk orang tua kita akan tidak bisa sampai ke Arash ( surga )|`|EiW7hTIsaa	setahu aku sich ya, kalo orang tu punya tanggungan ma Allah tidak lain penebusannya dengan taubat, sedang kalo punya kesalahan atau tanggungan ma sesama manusia tidak lain penebusannya harus dengan maaf ato kerelaan yang bersangkutan, jika soal masalah saudara . . . ya !!!, kalo bisa secepatnya tanggungan itu segera diselesaikan, entah nantinya ia rela ato tidakl, secepatnya tuntaskan masalah itu, trus kalo misal kondisi keuangan saudara tidak memungkinkan, ya mintalah dispensasi kepada yang bersangkutan. Inti dari semua itu, utang wajib dilunasi, sebelum ortu kita harus membayarnya diakhirat kelak dengan pahala yang dimilikinya, dan jika pahala tidak mencukupi maka dosa yang didzolimi akan diberikan kepadanya?. tapi jangan khawatir Allah maha adil dan bijaksanana, minta petunjuk kepadanya !!!|`|NMkK2mLSaa	Klo Orang tua kita mewasiatkan seperti itu Wajib Hukumnya,dan kita sebagai anak alangkah mulianya klo melunasi hutang2 org tua kita yang meninggal, karena itu juga belum cukup kita membalas budi orangtua yang melahirkan kita|`|THEU8JO4aa	Wajib untuk dilunasi.<br>  dan itu bukan hanya masalah hutang, jika dimasa hidupnya ortumu pernah membuat sakit hati seseorang sebagai anak wajib memintakan maafnya.|`|bnepD17Iaa	Menurut pendapat saya, secara wajar dan umum, apabila orangtua kita meninggalkan hutang, sebagai anak kita wajib melunasi hutang-hutang tersebut. Mengapa? Apabila kita melunasi hutang-hutang tersebut, berarti kita telah melapangkan jalan orang tua kita ke alam yang lebih damai di sorga sana. Apabila kita tidak mampu melunasi hutang-hutang tersebut, kita dapat meminta penangguhan atau cicilan dari pihak yang memberi hutang tersebut. Setidaknya sebagai anak kita berusaha untuk melunasi hutang tersebut dengan tidak melihat apakah hutang tersebut telah dipakai oleh orang tua kita untuk hal lain yang tidak ada hubungannya dengan keluarga termasuk kita anak-anaknya.
5Jskhsekaa	Not stare at her like a creep. All guys do and NEWS FLASH girls don't like it, they think it's creepy.|`|M6FdoIGBaa	First of all very ugly guys can get girls...Adrian Brody...if he didn't have that confidence and downright aggressive personality he could be considered bad, but the reason he is so frigging hot is because he puts himself out there, and goes after his dreams and he has learned the fine art of not caring what others think...so that is one. I mean he is too skinny, crooked long nose, crooked teeth, but his eyes are confident and relaxed, and his smile is open and sincere, and he stands erect and carries himself with depth of soul, like he could hug you in an instant.  That's attractive and that is just one example.  A short guy, would be Danny Devito...yeah in a suit he looks great, but when he was doing TAXI he was not a stud...funny as hell but I think the confidence is what makes him downright sexy.  That's what you need, the ability to say *uck this nonsense I am going to be who I am and get out there and be you.  I think you will be fine.  If you want the girls attention put yourself front and center with her and know that whatever you talk about whatever you do is worth her listening to...and make sure she understands that, you like her but you want to get to know her by telling her about yourself and asking her about herself.  Gotta do it hun.

But to actively try to interrupt what might be an otherwise happy relationship, that's sad.  And if karma exists, it will happen to you.|`|CLOtMCwSaa	Same here, Personally I dont do anything, unless they should start something first.

Well that is all I have ttyl.

You both are just barely starting dating just take it slow there is a lot of time ahead of you both to spend more time together.

Por que él me quiere demasiado entonces no veo por que no ser feliz con alguien aun que no sea muy bien agraciado y aún que la gente murmure si no te satisface por ese detalle te recomiendo que busques a otro pero sin lastimarlo por que eso sería muy ruin de tu parte pero tampoco lo tendrás enga?ado, pero ojo hazlo por lo que tu sientas y no por que la gente diga, si no al final de cuentas estarás con alguien que le guste a los demás aun que no te quiera y no sé si quieras eso para ti, piensa que tu eres la que va dormir con él y  no la demás gente.

0kh5cvdzaa	Primero debes de estar seguro que quieres casarte; este paso es sumamente serio y conlleva una serie de responsabilidades las cuales tu y tu novia tienen que asumir para el bien de la relacion. No se si trabajas ; pero es importante para poder mantener una familia. La familia de tu novia te acepto pero llegara el momento que tienes que buscar tu propio hogar para que ambos tengan su privacidad. La vida de matrimoni no es facil y mas si viene un hijo; aumenta mas la responsabilidad que a tan corta edad van a asumir. Se puede tener una familia saludable siempre y cuando esten los dos organizados y con las metas bien claras. Se habla mucho que el amor es bello, pero nunca se habla que para mantenerlo hay que trabajar mucho; pero saben? aprovechen la oportunidad de amarse y disfruten a su hijo mucho y sobretodo luchen por su amor y sigan hacia adelante.Exito!|`|HpzWVzEfaa	sola, primero que nada felicidades a ti por ser un hombre responsable, porque muchos chavos cuando tiene ese tipo de responsabilidad encima, prefieren hacerce a un lado y dejar a la pareja con un bebé, antes que hacerce cargo de ambos.<br>  Y segundo, aunque son muy jóvenes me da gusta que quieran formar una familia y sobre todo que sean muy felices.<br>  Ahora bien, qué es lo que quieres saber en realidad?, ?cuáles son los trámites a seguir? o ?qué cosa?|`|c8p3hqwGaa	Si todo esta como cuentas, va todo bien. ?Pero tienes medios de mantener una familia?

There is nothing wrong with you. Love just didn't choose to rest in the other person's heart.<br>     <br>  If you find someone else in love with you and you don't love him/her, feel honored that love came and called at your door, but gently refuse the gift you cannot return, do not take advantage, do not cause pain.<br>    <br>  How you deal with love is how you deal with you, and all our hearts feel the same pains and joys, even if our lives and ways are different.<br>     <br>  If you fall in love with another, and he/she falls in love with you, and then love chooses to leave, do not try to reclaim it or to assess blame, let it go. There is a reason and there is a meaning. You will know in time..<br>    <br>  Remember that you don't choose love. Love chooses you. All you can really do is accept it for all its mystery when it comes into your life. Feel the way it fills you to overflowing, then reach out and give it away.<br>   <br>   Give it back to the person who brought it alive in you. Give it to others who deem it poor in spirit.. Give it to the world around you in anyway you can. There is where many lovers go wrong. Having been so long without love, they understand love only as a need. They see their hearts as empty places that will be filled by love, and they begin to look at love as something that flows to them rather than from them.<br>    <br>  The first blush of new love is filled to overflowing, but as their love cools, they revert to seeing their love as need. They cease to be someone who generates love and instead become someone who seeks love.<br>   <br>   They forget that the secret of love is that it is a gift, and that it can be made to grow only by giving it away.|`|98322122f152865cd65551345f0ae3f8aa	a tes souhaits!!!!|`|LAZRQ86uaa	LOve is All we need|`|sXLwgTsEaa	l'amour c'est beau quand tout va bien mais il se barre c'est l'enfer|`|8xUzZAsdaa	baby don't hurt me , don't hurt me, no more..... <br>  il s'appelait comment le chanteur encore???<br>  <br>  Hattaway?|`|L7YuzWCmaa	c'est la vie|`|PYbo73XBaa	L'amour c'est tout et rien; c'est obligatoire et personne ne peut avoir certitude de la garder; l'amour, c'est plein de chose à la fois.|`|d3974f7176521660fc2f42b1cea1de16aa	un titre de chanson,non?jim carrey avait fait un skeatch mémorable avec cette chanson.|`|jvM1gdd2aa	the love is amour|`|ngXAtsuKaa	*...I don't know....*

La ex de mi actual pareja es una lata, no entiende que su ex-marido la dejó hace más de un a?o (y no fue por mi) la dejó por que ya no aguantaba sus escandalos y locuras y meses después me conoció a mi, pero es por el gusto. Me insulta, me llama al trabajo, me dice de todo y ya no sabe ni que hacer. Y lo peor del caso es que él la dejó por que por mas de 5 a?os ella lo enga?ó con otro hombre y todo el mundo lo sabía menos él. Y ahora ella dice que él la dejó por mi.

No sé cuantas ganas te quedaron de volver a intentar tener una nueva relación con alguien, pero si en un futuro decides intentarlo (de preferencia cuando tus ni?os ya sean mayores de edad, porque es feo que los ni?os se queden solos porque la mamá anda de "volada" con el novio) trata de analisar qué fue lo que pasó con esta relación que ya terminaste, y no inicies nada sino hasta que todas tus heridas estén sanadas, para que el nuevo hombre en tu vida no tenga que cargar con los platos rotos que dejó tu ex-marido.

La verdad es que lo único que te puedo aconsejar es que lo olvides, además que eres muy joven y te mereces un hombre que se dedique solo a ti y que no tengas que compartir con otra. A veses ellos dicen que van a dejar a la esposa y al final es mentira, lo hacen para que no lo dejes y al final es un circulo vicioso entre 3 personas que no termina nunca. <br>  Te deseo lo mejor y que seas muy feliz, y eso solo sera posible si te olvidas de esa persona.<br>  Saludos

8qV3QAYwaa	Primero que todo, debes tener muy presente que a la mayoría de las personas les gusta que les hagan sentir bien. Si tienes una chica y la quieres, a ella le encantará saberlo, pero también escucharlo. Eso hará que ella se sienta mejor contigo y por consiguiente, la relación será mejor.<br>  La única forma de expresarte es haciéndolo. Puede que te cueste al principio, pero no hay otra forma. Debes ser muy cuidadoso cuando empiezas a hacerlo y decir lo que en realidad quieres decir, de buena manera. <br>  Sería muy útil que tú mismo le dijeras a tu chica, por ejemplo, "Mira, sé que no soy expresivo (o "que soy algo torpe para expresarme"), pero estoy tratando de cambiar eso..... resulta que (bla, bla, bla)........" Creo que ella te puede ir ayudando a ver tu progreso. Háganlo juntos..... puede ser un cambio muy positivo!<br>  Puede que te hayan hecho creer que decir las cosas "no es de machos" o que tu crianza haya sido muy represiva. Es algo que tienes que solucionar, porque evidentemente te está causando problemas, si no no hubieras escrito nada aquí.<br>  Si lo tuyo es una barrera, algo que te impide decir las cosas, pues busca ayuda con un(a) terapeuta. Ese no decir las cosas puede arruinarte momentos o relaciones que pueden ser muy valiosas...... tú te lo estás perdiendo.|`|9nVyH8lvaa	LA ENTRADA A UN CíRCULO SUFí<br>  Si lees y si practicas, puedes estar cualificado para un círculo sufí.

E igualmente, el debe hacer lo mismo: regarte un poquito todos los dias. La relacion se mantiene  viva y hay que esforzarse en ello. Asi, al final del dia, creo que es lo mejor que uno pueda conseguir, a fin de poder tener a alguien a su lado al final del dia. Te deseo la mayor felicidad del mundo y estoy seguro que lo lograras.|`|qyc1ijyXaa	Pues creo que si te dice que eres la última es por que ya no va a tener otra y quiere estar contigo.

Dile a ella que el verdadero amor espera y se sacrifica por el bien, no es egoísta, y veo que tu no lo eres porque buscas primero su bien y no lo que te seria mas facil y satisfacer tu ego.

K2uQXZewaa	Creo que encontrar un "verdadero amor" no debe costarte NADA, ni en dinero ni en sacrificios. Por el contrario, el tener que "gastarle" a alguien para que te quiera, o el tener que renunciar a cosas para ti realmente valiosas, sería un perfecto indicador de que la cosa no va por ahí, pues entrarías a esa relación en posición subordinada.<br>  Es más: estoy convencido de que el amor no se busca, simplemente hay un buen día en que te das cuenta de que lo tienes frente a ti. Porque cuando lo buscas, es seguro que le vas a colgar tus ideales a quien no los tiene. <br>  ?Cómo la ves?|`|1KiWQLvJaa	se da todo por que en realidad el amor no tiene precio,y llega solo,solo hay que disfrutar la alegría que podamos dar así como el sufrimiento que pueda causar,aprender de el y disfrutarlo.|`|TqzH517daa	Si me costo mucho encontrar un gran hombre que me ama que me concienta que me entienda que tenga paciencia me costo muchas lagrimas y sufrimientos pero gracias a Dios esta conmigo y cuanto vale para mi y para se?or vale la sangre de cristo que no tiene precio|`|xJWOXzPLaa	el verdadero amor no tiene precio alguno|`|4oS9NmVgaa	el verdadero amor...... hay que ser sinceros y decir que no vale tanto la pena una persona, aveces confundimos eso y es por ello que se nos nubla mucho la visión, tomamos malas decisiones y algunos hasta se quitan la vida por alguna desilución aunque si, en efecto tiene sus recompensas jajaj|`|6gqVQmEaaa	5000 mil dolares|`|AA10306938	El Amor es en esencia verdadero, como don divino que es, y su valor es inconmensurable, pero no cuesta, es gratuito.

Lo que si cuesta es mantenerlo XD|`|d87a64acc85da9bfe7a790901b82cd76aa	la verdad es que el amor verdadero yo creo que es el que le da una madre a su hijo pues este amor si es incondicional totalmente no es egoísta no actúa de mala fe, ese amor es paciente dedicado siempre perdona y la verdad es que todos los seres humanos lo tenemos desde que nacemos pero no nos damos cuenta de su valor y lo desperdiciamos.<br>  yo no creo que exista otro tipo de amor que perdure por toda la vida dado que el amor que se le tiene a una pareja puede ser muy grande pero a los que nos hemos enamorado muchas veces nos pasa que amamos a la persona que tenemos en creemos que esa es la indicada y cuando se va sufrimos pero eventualmente dejamos de sufrir y nos volvemos a enamorar otra vez y así constantemente.<br>  En otras palabras un ser humano siempre vuelve a amar a una pareja diferente (yo considero que los seres humannos tenemos muchas "almas gemelas", ya que siempre estamos en constante evolucion)  sin embargo madre solo hay una ese debería de ser nuestro real "verdadero amor" y ese no tiene precio y no nos cuesta nada conseguirlo, lo tenemos desde antes de llegar a este mundo

XK8Upzjiaa	Se ha insinuado que los hombres que creen estar realmente estériles pueden sentirse más inclinados hacia la infidelidad conyugal. La vasectomía también puede agravar la tendencia en los hombres de edad mediana a descartar a sus esposas por mujeres más jóvenes.29<br>  <br>  Vasectomía<br>    Algunas Preguntas y Respuestas<br>   <br>  <br>  La permanencia relativa de la esterilización quirúrgica hace que mucha gente recapacite antes de tomar este paso tan serio. El temor a las enfermedades o a la muerte por causa de la Píldora o al DIU y sus efectos abortivos, los embarazos no planificados como resultado de métodos de barrera menos efectivos, y algunas veces la dificultad de manejar el auto control sexual hacen que muchas parejas recurran a la esterilización quirúrgica a causa de su desesperación.<br>  <br>  Muchas de estas parejas más tarde consideran que este paso fue drástico, especialmente luego de enterarse sobre el método moderno y efectivo de planificación natural de la familia, conocido como el Método Sintotérmico.<br>  <br>  ?Qué es la vasectomía?<br>  <br>  La vasectomía es una operación quirúrgica que se realiza para esterilizar sexualmente al hombre. En una vasectomía, el doctor corta una porción de ambos ductos (coductos deferentes) por donde pasa el semen proveniente de los testículos; luego amarra o coagula las extremidades y sutura el corte hecho al escroto. Usualmente se realiza bajo anestesia, pero la operación transcurre relativamente sin dolor, aunque a veces es común la hinchazón y sensitividad en el área durante el corto período de recuperación.<br>  <br>  ?Es la vasectomía 100% efectiva?<br>  <br>  No. Las únicas cirugías de esterilización 100% efectivas son la castración del hombre (remoción de ambos testículos) y la castración femenina (remoción de ambos ovarios); estas cirugías no se realizan expresamente para el control de la natalidad.<br>  <br>  La vasectomía tiene un índice de fracaso de .1% (un décimo de un por ciento).1 La recanalización, cuando se vuelve a unir un conducto deferente a través de los procesos de sanación interna, ocurre una en mil casos y a veces el urólogo no logra captar la rara presencia de un tercer conducto deferente. Ambas situaciones pueden concluir en un embarazo sorpresa.2<br>  <br>  ?Cuáles son los riesgos a la salud <br>  por la vasectomía?<br>  <br>  Aunque no ha salido el veredicto final sobre los riesgos a la salud por la vasectomía, se sospecha que los efectos a largo plazo en el sistema inmunológico del hombre pueden representar problemas graves a la salud. En la comunidad médica hay un aumento en las críticas en torno a la manera [poco crítica] que la vasectomía ha sido declarada como médicamente segura. Entre el 10 y 15 por ciento de los hombres adultos en los E.U.A. se han realizado vasectomías,3 y sin embargo, de acuerdo al comentario escrito del doctor H.J. Roberts, "no conozco ninguna cirugía en seres humanos que induzca reacciones en el sistema inmunológico a tal grado".4<br>  <br>  ?Qué le ocurre al semen?<br>  <br>  Después de la vasectomía, la producción de semen continúa igual que antes, alrededor de 50,000 espermatozoides por minuto.5 Por falta de un pasaje anatómico normal, estas células son consumidas por células destructoras (macrófagos) o se degeneran y producen antígenos que producen anticuerpos.6<br>  <br>  Se han identificado al menos ocho antígenos espermáticos. Con frecuencia estos entran al flujo sanguíneo e inducen a otras células a través del cuerpo a producir anticuerpos en contra del semen. éstas son conocidas como los "auto-anticuerpos antiespermatozoides".<br>  <br>  ?Qué es la autoinmunización?<br>  <br>  Los anticuerpos son la forma de inmunizarnos para resistir enfermedades específicas de nuestro medio ambiente. Los antígenos son el mecanismo de reacción que el cuerpo necesita para producir los anticuerpos adecuados para su defensa. Un ejemplo de este efecto es la reacción alérgica que se suscita cuando el cuerpo está levemente sensitivo a cierta célula de un alimento.<br>  <br>  Cuando el cuerpo prepara sus defensas para destruir las células que él mismo ha construido, como sucede luego de una vasectomía, entonces el cuerpo se torna alérgico a sí mismo.<br>  <br>  ?Hay alguna relación entre la <br>  autoinmunización y la vasectomía?<br>  <br>  Varios estudios realizados en la década de los setenta confirman esta relación. Se descubrió la relación entre los anticuerpos y los antígenos espermáticos de 55 a 75 por ciento en pacientes luego de dos a?os de haberse realizado la vasectomía.7 En 1982, una investigación se?aló, " ... la incidencia de anticuerpos espermáticos después de una vasectomía puede haber sido escasamente detectada."8 Es tan común ver esta reacción en hombres que han tenido la vasectomía que la ausencia de estos anticuerpos se ha convertido en el indicador del malfuncionamiento de las hormonas.9 Con métodos más avanzados de detección, ha sido posible detectar la reacción de anticuerpos dos semanas después de haberse realizado la vasectomía.10<br>  <br>  ?Cuáles son algunas de las enfermedades<br>   de autoinmunidad?<br>  <br>  Se sospecha que la autoinmunidad puede causar enfermedades tales como la esclerosis múltiple, diabetes mellitus, artritis reumatoide y algunos tipos de hepatitis, la enfermedad de Addison (malfuncionamiento de las glándulas adrenales) y lupus eritematoso.11<br>  <br>  Un estudio sobresaliente realizado por Nancy J. Alexander y Thomas B. Clarkson concluyó que "la reacción inmunológica al antígeno espermático que con frecuencia acompa?a la vasectomía puede agravar la arteroesclerosis" (el endurecimiento de las arterias).12 Estudios sucesivos han apoyado estos hallazgos.13<br>  <br>  ?Existe riesgo de cáncer?<br>  <br>  Al comienzo de la década de los ochenta, el doctor Richard Ablin, un investigador del Instituto Hektoen de Chicago, formuló la hipótesis de que el cáncer de la próstata puede ser causado por el semen no eyaculado. Una década más tarde los epidemiólogos reportaron una "inesperada asociación" entre la vasectomía y el cáncer de la próstata. Otro estudio encontró que el riesgo de cáncer se incrementó entre 3.5 y 5.3 veces;14 un estudio independiente descubrió el riesgo total de 1.7 más veces comenzando 12 a?os después de la operación de vasectomía e incrementándose 2.2 veces (el doble del riesgo) de 13 a 18 a?os más tarde.15 Se realizaron dos estudios en hombres que se sometieron a una vasectomía en la Escuela de Medicina de Harvard y publicados en 1993. Se encontró que el riesgo total de cáncer de la próstata aumentó entre 56 a 60 por ciento, incrementándose en un 89% en hombres que se sometieron a una vasectomía hace 20 a?os o más.16<br>  <br>  El cáncer de la próstata es la segunda causa de muerte de cáncer entre los hombres norteamericanos, reclamando 30,000 vidas al a?o. Aunque estos estudios no probaron ninguna relación concluyente entre la vasectomía y el cáncer de la próstata, la Asociación Americana de Urología, insta a sus paciente a estar informados sobre los riesgos fundamentándose en estos estudios.17<br>  <br>  El creciente riesgo del cáncer en los pulmones, el linfoma Non Hodgkin, y el mieloma múltiple fueron observados en hombres, 20 a?os después que tuvieron la vasectomía.18 El Estudio sobre la Arteria Coronaria, en el cual se examinaron a 1,106 hombres, encontró un riesgo dos veces mayor de piedras en el ri?ón en pacientes de 30-35 a?os de edad que se sometieron a una vasectomía.19 Se ha observado también una relación con el cáncer testicular. Un sistema inmunológico saludable es nuestra defensa diaria en contra del cáncer.20 Los autores de los estudios de Harvard formularon su hipótesis: "la reacción inmunológica a los antígenos espermáticos luego de la vasectomía pueden incrementar el crecimiento de un tumor cuando los antígenos espermáticos bloquean los anticuerpos de las células que suprimen el tumor."21<br>  <br>  ?Son las vasectomías reversibles?<br>  <br>  Las costosas técnicas de microcirugía revierten la esterilización tanto en hombres como en mujeres. Su éxito práctico varía grandemente. Por ejemplo, un estudio publicado reportó índices de alrededor de 50%;22 informes anecdotales muestran índices de hasta 80%. Aún así, los hombres y las mujeres "deben reflexionar que cualquier tipo de técnica de esterilización es permanente."23<br>  <br>  ?Existen efectos secundarios sicológicos?<br>  <br>  Una prueba estandarizada de desórdenes de personalidad reveló que, más de un 40% de un grupo bajo estudio que se había sometido a una vasectomía, experimentaron disturbios de personalidad entre la primera prueba y la última, un a?o posterior a la operación.24<br>  <br>  Un estudio sobre el funcionamiento sicológico, que incluyó a pacientes que se sometieron a una vasectomía y a sus esposas realizado por el doctor Frederick Ziegler, encontró " sorprendentes cambios adversos y una reducida satisfacción conyugal en el esposo y la esposa a pesar de la satisfacción general hacia el procedimiento en sí."25|`|3dgA6cUzaa	No influye en nada, mas bien te dara paz de que dejaras a nadie embarazada.|`|WZcoMvNFaa	yo me hise esa operacion hace 3 a?os  y no e tenido ningun problema de los que estas hablando al contrario aparte de que  es segura  disfrutas mas plenamente tu relacion<br>  Cualesquier pregunta guelyon@yahoo.com|`|hHkqmROiaa	Absolutamente NADA te afecta en tu rendimiento sexual porque todo sigue exactamente igual. <br>  Yo tengo 15 a?os con vasectomía y todo funciona igual y yo sin preocupaciones porque sé que me siento mejor y sin estar pensando en que mi pareja quede embarazada así que para mí ha sido todo completamente NORMAL.<br>  Suerte y adelante.|`|prN5mZp9aa	Supe del esposo de una familiar, y segun ella, el ya no rinde igual.

g9RQ7ediaa	you might need professional counseling<br>  You are on the right path..getting YOUR life in order.If you feel like moving back home do it but not if the only reason is hoping to get back with guy #1.Break all ties with abusive guy..learn to love yourself..learn to function being alone and on your own ( as in no guy) for awhile THEN you can try again  but you will probably have to face the fact that you will not get guy #1 back. He would probably be too afraid of getting hurt again or he may also have realized he deserved to be treated better than you treated him.<br>  It will not be easy, but you KNOW where you went wrong...this is how you learn what to do or not do with the next guy you meet

Not to mention it looks bad as far as intentions are concerned. Do her parents know about it? Do they even know that the two are dating?<br>  <br>  There's a lot of potential issues with a 21 year old guy dating a 16 year old girl here that go beyond just the law. She's still in high school while he's in college or the work world, so that's a difference of each person's life stage. Also, she's 16, so she is still an adolescent, whereas he is an actual man. It's a mismatch based on that alone.<br>  <br>  Plus, if they are sexually active, and she gets pregnant.... yikes.... trouble...... she's still in high school, how will she finish? Will he want to be tied down with the responsibility of taking care of a kid? Probably not.<br>  <br>  His best bet is to keep his johnson zipped in his pants and to find someone else to date.

4RwboLk2aa	It's called immaturity. When we are young, we are not used to displaying emotions like that. We show off in front of our friends because we don't want to be teased for being weak. When we get older, and more comfortable in how we are, we aren't as worried about what others think.|`|a7ehLBcLaa	i just act like myself, if the girl dosent like me then screw her :D|`|RL9wZs3Iaa	Heh, I personally have nothing to show off. When I talk to a girl, I find that it just works better if I am my nice, un-macho self. And of course, I am not exactly Don Juan or anything, but I feel that girls (as a whole) are more willing to talk to someone who isn't trying to be Macho Man.<br>  <br>  I don't really think that that answered your question in anyway. But I think that some guys do it because they want to get noticed and to actually feel that they are "getting the babes". Some girls marvel at athletic or talented guys, and if guys find that it works, then they will keep doing it. That's my explanation, any way.|`|ERvhiXIzaa	most guys do it to impress and seem masculine. its acutally rather stupid in my opinion.<br>  <br>  because you are trying to get someone to notice you, but you aren't acting like yourself. you are being fake. they should notice your for your unique personality and triats not what you act to be.<br>  <br>  thats just my opinion. i'm myself around girls that i like, considering my girl bestfriend and the girl i like are the same person:P|`|KzLupcK5aa	it's a guy thing XD

Be prepared to answer a lot of questions about him. Don't get all emo and get into a squabble. See if she'll let him come over sometime so she can meet him.<br>  <br>  Parents can be an obstacle or a big help. Work with them... don't try to fight them.|`|1d58a0751f7fb6228a95e6c370f555c9aa	How about just telling her where you met him, what he's like, what you like about him.  Unless you're too young in her opinion, you shouldn't meet much resistance to talking about someone new who you find interesting!   You could preface that by asking her how old she was when she started noticing boys.  Hopefully, she'll notice you're open to talking about that and the conversation will unfold without your being nervous!  Congrats on wanting to share with your mom!|`|IuYH51gdaa	well i am 14 and i would just be talking to my mom and say....today this boy ******* asked me to be his girlfriend and i am.... or i said yes....<br>  or try saying....mom i have a boyfriend! then tell her about him.  <br>  any way you go be sure to tell her about him and she will want to know about him. and be happy that you included her....<br>  hope i helped|`|RL9wZs3Iaa	I think that it's just best to tell her straight up. That's the best way to do it. If she gets flustered or is worrying, have a honest conversation with her.

You can always be Just friends with him AND his family. His family can be like you close friends too, if you know what I mean. And long-distance relationships are complicated.

Making her miss you may accidentally backfire. Just ignore her, make like you're moving on. She can't have it both ways. She is keeping you at arm's length, for her benefit, not yours. Once she sees you aren't groveling at her feet, she just might come to her senses and come back to you! Good Luck!|`|LoPEfZjkaa	making someone miss you is kind of like revenge. someone does something you don't agree to, so in result you do something back. vice versa. the right thing to do, is to let her understand what she's doing, on her own. every girl needs space, and a time away from her problems. she probably is in love with you but doesn't know if loving you is right or not, so she goes out with other guys as a way to get her issues off her chest. listen hunny your doing the right thing, keep letting her know how much you love her, just don't nag her about it, she might feel overwhelmed and stressed because you continue to tell her you love her and she knows not what to do.|`|QBipraKlaa	i'll admit you messed up, you pressured her when she needed her space. apologize and then give her her space, all of it|`|c21a17144312842cdd56a17614becaf0aa	Give her her space and go out and have some fun.

But if you're pretty sure he's flirting then go for it. =)
0hOg2N7Iaa	Ha... Not a problem. Hang out with her for a while. Eventually she'll like you.  Happened to me :).|`|eyptyb4paa	Try just being her friend first. You don't want to be too pushy right after she has broken up with someone. She is still sensitive. Just be there for her and only time can tell what will happen.|`|0gBaAyKWaa	talk to her<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK<br>  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX...|`|WsnaN84Naa	hmmmm.......... my advice to you is just to take things slow... try talking to her and get to know her better. Try casually flirting with her. Try making her forget about her ex... don't come straight out and say it just try and make her forget about him by making her think of other people such as yourself. Don't be to pushy though! (: lol wellllllllllllll............ i hope this eventually helps your situation! :) good luck!<br>  <3, saxophone girl|`|b4b009a3652c21d78e4232ae23ffe9d4aa	be a good friend and support her till gets over the other guy.<br>  <br>  but be careful and don't let her use you as a "friend", which usually means she will talk to you when she feels down but will never let you see her naked.|`|dBTOUOvZaa	You should show her that you like her alot by flirting with her but dont rush into things to fast. You should also wait a little bit so she can get over him a little more. Then ask her out. i hope i helped you.|`|e9gDjv6Maa	persuade her.. flirt with her.... make her get over him.|`|o89KvHGsaa	Take it slow, flirt. Then time will tell and when the time is right, go with your gut.
dJokY7F8aa	dont worry about partying they do it at that age to be cool cause they think it is bad ***, but in reality its stupid at that age.  I never partied till I was 19 and i wasn't a loner, and it doesn't effect your grades, well some peoples it does, but not most people. that is just what people tell you to scare you not to do it.  Also girls are dumb and think they can do whatever and just say oh, I was drunk.  And sure they feel popular (happy) cause lots of those girls get praise from guys for having sex.  Just my thoughts/opinions.  <br>  Try to find people you can relate to. Its easier in college though.  so many more people.|`|I6NwduJPaa	Wow, I was kind thinking I was the only one. I'm 16, and i know how you feel. As cheesy as this sounds, you should probably try talking to a psychologist about how you're feeling. I do, and it really helps. Personally, I like doing stuff with friends, but i feel like i dont really know how to act when I'm out with them, so I don't always enjoy myself much. What I do is I go out anyway, for practice, it really helps. But mostly, talk to your parents or a psychologist
gGXV5doSaa	doesnt matter, id rather have a pretty brunette than a ugly blonde nasty, and vice versa|`|RL9wZs3Iaa	I am personally a brunette fan. Not really much else there is to say.|`|1ta3U2H8aa	Depends on the guy.|`|HcqRycY0aa	Guys like blonde better but for all the wrong reasons|`|LqS74GPBaa	I'm not a guy but it all depends on each guys preferances.  It has been shown that "most" men like women with blonde hair, but its not always true. Just like you may prefer guys with brown hair, but will occasaionly find one with blonde hair attractive, the same rule applies for men. My advice though, is to dye your hair a color that you like and that suits you well.  Don't only dye your hair in order to attract guys, and if you meet a guy who will only date blonde women, or will only date brunette women than he is shallow and I would avoid him.  Confidence is a real turn on for men, and incredibly large turn on, so if you choose a hair color that you like and that suits you, you will find you are going to attract more men and the right type of men as well...hope that helps.

Lawc7qiwaa	That's a toughie. You need to look at it two ways: firstly that he still likes someone else, therefore doesn't yet like you that way. Also consider the very real possibility that your friend likes him back.<br>  <br>  You need to give it some time, see where his feelings are, and what he does. <br>  <br>  Remember, if he goes for your best friend, DON'T GET JEALOUS OR TRY TO BREAK THEM UP. I can't stress that enough. He didn't chose you, so get over it. Be happy for your friend.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  :)|`|823483cd7c6ae5cf96d5e52dde65697aaa	SHOOT A RUBBER BAND IN THE SHAPE OF A PIG AT HIS MOTHERS SHOOTER|`|6a221e63714f9d33724ccb40cd162c0aaa	Wait a while...this guy needs to figure himself out. also, your friend may not be cool with it. if she's the jealous type you may want to not pursue this relationship, if her friendship is important to you. you should talk to her about it (if she's not upset about breaking up or anything.) also it may look a bit bad if you get with your best friends' boyfriend right after they break up. if it's just a crush, try to wait it out.
dGBbFwFWaa	when u like someone or have feelings for some one and ur close enough to trust and communicate with this person is always best to say how u feel and not wait...  u can know how the other feels if u dont ask.. good luck ...|`|TU7vDI95aa	Forget him.  He's going out with your friend.  If you went out with him, it would be a complete betrayal of your friend.|`|VeahdIMzaa	ya missed ur chance hunny!|`|13ad441e093cbc079e39a16db26ef065aa	Well maybe he liked you but then seeing as you werent making a move and didnt know you felt that way about him, decided that you werent interested and moved on.|`|6a221e63714f9d33724ccb40cd162c0aaa	Well apparently he doesn't, honey. You guys can still be friends. Don't be too disappointed...he's just one fish in the sea! :)|`|Cl0mhAHbaa	the early bird gets the worm<br>  he was just making a list of women to date him and the first one that asks will get him...trust me i am a|`|KxNZfCDDaa	Well, perhaps "Joe" just wanted to be your friend and get to know you more. It's okay to like somebody who does that, but there's no need to a quick rush-in relationship.<br>  <br>  Trust me, I know what that's like.<br>  <br>  As for "Sally" you just gotta be there for her like the good friend you are. And don't let "Joe" ruin your friendship. Remember "Relationships come and go, but friendships are forever."|`|VL4TYtfQaa	He's probably seeing what his options are. If you like him and you think he likes you talk to him. he might like you more than Sally. <br>  <br>  Guys fish with nets not with fishing rods though so he might want both of you. I don't know what he's game is though but generally guy can't really be trusted. Not all of us but most of us.

At the rate that things are going now, I'm stating to have a great interest in the after life, and I don't mean religion, or suicide.

JEEZ!!!!!|`|4XDiZA8Taa	If life was not complicated, then it would be really boring.

I wouldn't really encourage you to date him or make a move because that would just make things incredibly weird, and i imagine that he is probably older than you and probably is in a relationship anyways. good luck! :)|`|92rdbIamaa	Sounds like you have a crush on him, and this is perfectly normal thing that we sometimes develop a crush on someone we admire.<br>  <br>  This man is intelligent and interesting to you, and he has a great chair side manner, do not mistake his kindness for anything else..<br>  This man is probably married with children, and don't allow your feelings to over take your thoughts...<br>  <br>  It is OK to fantasize but not the the point you are obsessing over this man.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck
BNdoUMaraa	Attraction is when you're attracted to something/someone...you could be attracted to be a piece of gum! It's when you're interested in something/someone and you just feel...attracted. Or drawn in to that one person or thing.|`|6a221e63714f9d33724ccb40cd162c0aaa	attraction is simply finding someone physically, or mentally, appealing. Attraction occurs in strange ways; often you don't want to be attracted to someone, but you are. even ex-boyfriend/girlfriends still sometimes find each other attractive. you can't "create" attraction or "try" to make attraction; it's natural and an instinctive response to meeting or being with someone. if you're trying to get someone to be attracted to you, be yourself - you want them to be attracted to you, not someone you're pretending to be.|`|JQq53j3Kaa	There are different levels of attraction. Often what brings people together in the first place is physical attraction. People usually look for people that they feel have the same amount of attractiveness or smartness or of some quality to bring into a relationship. Then there is attractiveness of the mind. People just get along together and click, seeing as people change over time it is perfectly possible that they could try again. I am now good friends with someone that I openly hated years ago so it could be possible. Good luck to whoever the couple is!
6a221e63714f9d33724ccb40cd162c0aaa	This girl doesn't seem too interested in you if she refers you to one of her friends whom you didn't even know very well. Her body language also tells that she just likes you as a friend...usually if a girl likes you she'll stay close to you and want to dance with you and talk with you. You guys should stay good friends, but it doesn't seem like she likes you as anything more...I would just lay off any romance and be good friends with her. As for the girl with the Junior Prom, maybe it being awkward is a sign you shouldn't be together either. I would join some afterschool activities or sports in order to meet more people and friends - that way you will probably meet more girls.|`|e15607a8c66590d715420cbfe5d2db7faa	You're doing great in the looks department but you have to work on your confidence.  You must first overcome your self-consciousness.  You have to turn your focus on them and not think about yourself saying this or doing that. Let yourself flow naturally, let go and be yourself the way you are with people you know well.|`|6GUpUXoXaa	It's hard to be comfortable around others but it's something that just has to happen.. You don't have to be the life of the party just try to get involved... it's good that you play football because you do get some kind of social experience but there is nothing wrong with talking to random people in your school... try different stuff out maybe an after school thing or find out where people hang out just to get the hang of things... you need to open yourself up or its going to be really hard in the future to meet and have relationships with people|`|UBvIzrdAaa	I hate to say, but if this is your first relationship, it probably isn't going to happen. The best way however, is to be with her the majority of the time. Definitly follow her to her friends and stuff, and be humorous, if you just stand there, they will think you are a wierdo. Bring her to your house or vice-versa, watch boring romance movies, if she's a dancer then make videos of dancing, etc. Best thing though is not to leave her to go hang with other people, or to go straight home afterschool, they hate that..<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  ~Cmatizzle
6a221e63714f9d33724ccb40cd162c0aaa	Well, he told your friend that he likes you. Maybe instead of texting, you should talk to him in person! Meet up somewhere and just talk to each other...he may be a bit shy or reserved because he has a son and doesn't want to hurt his son. Remember...you can't make someone like you. If he likes you and sparks fly when you meet, maybe you should try a relationship.|`|b6Vt8iG7aa	he doesnt like you...move on.....you cant make anyone like you...

HwbKKtNUaa	well this sounds kind of bad but it's true..you need to talk to all of them and flirt with all of them..(don't let the other ones seeing you do it tho) and then it will become more obvious to you who you like spending time with the most. then STOP flirting with all the other girls and spend your time focused on the one girl that is the best for you.|`|6b7eeb4f41fa6f871211ccd21d079e24aa	date the one that you really like and think would have fun spending time with|`|6a221e63714f9d33724ccb40cd162c0aaa	Hang out a bit with each, and figure out which one you like.

86e761eea803c859af25b4c007ae9cf0aa	He's going to sweet talk you into getting what he wants.  He may like you for more than just a physical level, but he still has got himself stuck in a bind and now basically  just wants his cake and eat it too.   He has two girls that he likes and why wouldn't he leave if one doesn't know anything and the other doesn't care?   <br>  <br>  For him to only see you when he can means that his first girlfriend is his main priority.  When he says he thinks his girlfriend is the one for him and he hates lying it's probably the truth but he still wants to get away with what he is doing, which is wrong.  He will continue to do this and will NOT leave his current girlfriend so you will only get more hurt in the long run.  I'd stop if I were you and tell him that if he can't be with JUST you than he truly doesn't deserve you.  You need to love yourself and know what you are worth.  Don't let some guy take advantage of you.  You deserve it to yourself and owe it to yourself to have a boyfriend that thinks the world of you and loves only you.|`|dC5wbwYgaa	if he really wanted 2 b with u he wuld leave his girlfriend!<br>  he just wants u for the sex, girl!|`|6a221e63714f9d33724ccb40cd162c0aaa	He won't. Even if he does....I really don't think you should pursue this relationship. He says he fantasizes about you and is willing to cheat on his girlfriend for you. He'll probably do the exact same thing to you when you two are in a relationship; he'll start being attracted to fresh meat and shower them with compliments and sweet stuff. He's really not worth it.|`|8UiXGkL9aa	sweetheart ur worth so much more than being the other woman. this guy is trying to have his cake and eat it. if he does leave her for you what's gonna stop him from doing it to you once ur sex life sizzles? u know there r soooo many men out there that are single and will treat you the way u should be treated. secret rendevous r fun for a while i'm sure but not fullfilling at all.|`|AA10153018	Let me first start by saying "If he did it for you, he'll do it to you later."  What that means is that if he's seeing you on the side and still in a committed relationship with someone else, chances are that when he dumps his girlfriend, has you...that will be okay for a while but then one day he will find another woman on the side and do the same thing to you--dump you for someone else.<br>  <br>  He could just be looking for a booty call and not at all interested in a relationship with a committment with you. Is that what you want too? Sounds to me like he is simply looking to satisfy his needs in the bedroom, not a relationship.  He is afterall, with a woman who has been he girlfriend for a year and a half.<br>  <br>  As much as you say you like him...you should never be with a man that is in a relationship.  If he is truly worth being in a relationship with -- wait until he is single and ask him out.  You will feel better about the situation and not have the notion of cheating if you too date each other while you are both single.  Don't get yourself caught up with this fella until he's 100% single again.  Trust me, the drama with his lil mama ain't worth kisses and more from that man. <br>  <br>  Save your heart for someone (single) available and worth your time.|`|JS3LDNeJaa	What you r doing is 2-faced imagine you were his GF and being cheated on, talk to him ive him an ultimatum, but I think u need to stop this affair but your choice.|`|JZq72meKaa	back off -- obviously nothing is going to come out of this situation unless he cuts ends with her. he can't have his cake and eat it too. by you giving him what he wants he has no reason to break up with his girl because he is getting the best of both worlds. back off and if he is really in to you then he will break up with her.. what you are doing is wrong.|`|eFmhC7xeaa	think about it if he cheated on his girlfriend now what gaurantees you that he wont cheat on u|`|s8AVP8Teaa	If he cheats on her with you...he'll end up cheating on you with someone else.|`|t9uddDDkaa	i am not sure about the situation, but it seems like you are forever and always will be the other woman with him. if he was serious about being with you then he would have left his girl by now and since you slept with him the first chance you got (no offense) he only sees you as sex and that is it. you are just the other woman and he most likely will not leave his gf just for you.
dDNdtDP0aa	Its sheep syndrome, she is just following what she believes to be the right thing to do due to her lable i.e Emo,<br>  <br>  I cut myself for ages, I only started doing it when I read about it online, It made others feel better so I hoped it might me and it did, but it became a drug the more i felt crappy the more I would cut, in the end I realised that it wasnt a soloution to the pain just a relief, besides the physical pain goes but the scars are always there.|`|5FkL3szOaa	i do the exact same thing wen i get angry and upset over my boyfriend.. i just dont think i want him 2 notice me 2 really notice me and see how depressd i am:(|`|60bc0a55f4ad039cbdd9e5b8867b9facaa	well... that is very odd that your friend cut her wrists like you,.... I used to cut until my parents found out... i ended up being put into a behavioral center, and there i was able to cope with my problems through exercise... try talking to your friend and explain to her that you dont want to cut and when you told her you were asking for her help, not for her to start.|`|AA12314306	Hey I Cut and still cutting my wrist! Anyway , I wouldnt advise your friend to cut her wrist. She did that because she wanted be be like you. Stop cutting your own and she would proabably stop.|`|cCxNTarNaa	haha same thing here<br>  about the pain thoo<br>  not about my friend<br>  my friend is all like against it and whatnot but my other friend thinks its okk<br>  OMG ! <br>  i tell him to stop butt he won't listen<br>  soo yeaa<br>  (btw im trying to stop too but its like .. you can't)|`|itjHN3CKaa	Sounds like your friend is trying to be cool and emo. Unlike you im guessing .You guys need some help. Trying talking to each other instead of cutting. Build a friendship together. So if one of you feels hopeless talk to the other. Its better than cutting yourself.|`|qhKqP9Sxaa	yea i cut too...and i see where ur gettin at...but i must say...i cant stand people that do that stuff just to say there emo....but my advice..let ur friend do it.....but let me tell ya.. cutting leaves scars...it really does..they go away for about a week but one day with too much sun they'll come back, like little scars..i bet ur going through a tough time..but cutting doesnt REALLY help..it actually just makes you feel better mentally...its actually an interesting subject for me..but like i said let ur friend cut..it will probably just get her into a mess with her parents anyway..and as for you..its really ur choice...im not trying to get you to stop..but if you take a second to really think it over than u might realize that cutting isnt always the best answer..well i gave the advice my best shot! if you need anything--someone to talk to, a question,..just email me or somethin!<br>  <br>  hope your problems end up working out for ya!
0f5b91339bd32234b4d46763c2d39b37aa	No! It's just good clean fun! If you do something with them then that's an issue but if you're just 13 then you might wanna tone it down a bit just until you're a bit older because the message it sends can sometimes be the wrong one|`|6a221e63714f9d33724ccb40cd162c0aaa	Depends on how many guys....grinding itself isn't very slutty, but if you do it like to a million guys, some girls may be jealous. also it depends how you grind (dirty vs. regular.)|`|3N4QXVJwaa	okay if you're grinding a bunch of guys then yes that is slutty. and your only thirteen!? omg. i would slow it down if i were you unless you want to get a reputation as a ****. grinding one or two close guy friends isnt bad, ive done it. but like i said grinding a bunch of guys does not look good.|`|IdmvVIUKaa	I would say no.  Generally the only people that would say it is are other girls  and guys who you didnt dance with|`|oZtXAWx7aa	its just kinda nasty for other people to see...its kinda slutty but as long as you arent doing anything with them|`|wSByYAu3aa	Well I think it is a little slutty. Well it depends. If you are single then I would say go right ahead and do what you like. If you are in a relationship, I guess it would depend on what kind of relationship you have with your boyfriend. If you guys are in a relationship where that would be OK then it is OK. If you are not in a relationship where it isn't OK and you are doing it anyways then you have a problem. Have fun girl :)
JKuTvdfeaa	sell em on the street and use the money to get yourself a new hair doo!   ew..|`|ij4iWrUVaa	Well if u were an honest person,I think it would be best to turn them in,there is probably a lee fortunate family with children waiting for them foodstamps that were actually mailed to the wrong place.......It's left up 2 u do the right thing be the better person..............:>|`|0udjgaoBaa	well you have to know the pincode to use the card...That happened to me and it took me 45 days to figure out the pin!|`|yy45iAbtaa	they don't mail food stamps out anymore.your question is a fraud.|`|VmQBhY6iaa	do u have the  ebt card? if u dont have the card which also have a pin  that u choose when u first got it,then u cant us them since dont have how.It probably means they(dcf/welfare) approved u for $300 of food stamps,most times they dont make mistakes,and if they do is by not giving u nothing,not by giving u something|`|iNQK27Qqaa	actually they do still mail them out. I would not use them, if you are caught using them, prepare for fines and possibly jailtime
8XKmMBU7aa	If any lady run away from her house. hahah how his husband can forget these things. hehehe If she will go back to her house, her life will definite be hell and if his husband will live with her, people will say him many things. I think that you may file for divorce. She is happy with any. She have no tension about you. Why are you thinking about her. Is there any week point in you ? Why did she leave her house ?  I don't find any Joke on this beautiful question.  You may find Joke from www.google.com  If Answer of same question in Joke, it should be really Crazy.    Have a nice day and nice dream.|`|aGwjf2y4aa	dont think u casn do much why dont u let har move in so she can pay half itll save u paying for the lot till u sell it its a hard game ive been their but i was lucky enough to get my house sold before the divorce got nasty why dont u seek legal advice from your solicitor or citizens advce!!  but she is legally married to u and does have rights im afraid!!!|`|yy45iAbtaa	nothing she can move back into the house and you will both have to pay half the mortgage till the house is sold as long as her name is on the house you can't do a thing.|`|dSMb8JDvaa	She is very angry..typical woman. If she hurts she wants you to hurt 10 times more than her. Even though she didn't help you even 1 cent paying the house but the house is also in her name...everything have to share half. (My husband already learn the lesson) So try to hang on the marriage until you can settle the issues. Have you got kids together?, be careful child support may chasing you if she got custody of the child as well. Try to fix everything and make an agreement with her, lawyer cost also..unbelievable high..good luck|`|197Xps6Raa	Find some tennants and super quick!!!   She is legally entitled to move back in if her name is on the mortgage and deeds until an greement has been reached or judgement been passed.  Im divorcing my husband and there is nout i can do to move him out so dont see why it wouldnt be the same on the other side.  Let her pay half the mortg if she moves back in, that is fair on both parties.  Dont assume that because the mortg didnt come out of her wages that she wont argue that she contributed in other ways to the running/upkeep etc of the household.  Too many men make the mistake of undervaluing their partners input into the relationship in financial terms, especially when children are involved.  Be careful, get good sound advice and keep a cool rational head on you.
iJqYC0vkaa	funeral yes, viewing no. but respond to them. I took my 3 boys than 5 6 and 2 to my grandfathers funeral. They didn't go to the viewing. And at the funeral we stood in the back where I could talk to them and answer their questions without bothering others. I think they learned a great deal about life, and death. And how to be respectful to those who pass and those who morn. I think veiwing a dead body might give them nightmares. espically since the person never looks like themselves. Let them remember how Grandpa looked not laying in a box.|`|WSlxwSlFaa	i was tooken when I was about 7, I seen and got really close to the dea body, then to my other grandfathers when i was 9. take them, it will be a learning experience. cant shelter them their whole lives. -_-|`|lYjweuZmaa	No.  i was young when i saw my great grandmother be burried and i cried and couldnt sleep for the longest. seeing a  dead body would probably taunt them. they will wonder why granpa wont wake up. why are they putting grandpa into the ground. i dont think it is a good idea. i still have those memories.|`|aXYiOskmaa	not too young at all. funerals aren't the silent dismal affairs that they once were. it's their grandpa too and all their family will be there.everyone will be talking and such. they'll be fine. odds are, they won't even pay attention to what's going on. kids are more resilient than we give them credit for.  my condolences on the loss of your grandfather|`|GmTMVmASaa	when my brother was killed, my kids were very young, 8-6-and 5. i didn't take them to the funeal, because i did not want them to see him dead. now they are 32-31 and 34, and my daughter(32) says perhaps they would have understood death better if they had gone. but i myself wasn't in the right frame of mind then, so i think i did what i felt was best. at any rate, i think you should follow your heart.|`|ivH0ymWgaa	No you shouldnt take her to funeral.  A child mind is so fragile it never understand the concept of death.|`|BE9cjcxgaa	I think it depends on how mature they are, I would say they are too young, but if they are exceptionally mature then it might be ok.|`|ij4iWrUVaa	I has a mother would rather my children remember him the way he was and not the way he is now.......That could really take a toll on some children just let them remember him the way they were happy seeing him............
pXS9xa1Laa	well it might not be a hard on as u think, he might just be a large man in general, or maybe he really likes you, if hes youngish then hes got a lot of hormones and maybe he hasn't "released" in awhile and can't control it|`|UmA4TbDGaa	Hes probably excited to see you and wearing boxers|`|LKbH8Xunaa	he is excited to see you and probably imagines things that are dirty so that makes him do that|`|aZsyxJ5Gaa	looool,my b/f is always having hard-ons,i used to wonder too but then i let it go..i actually think its kinda cute coz he smoetimes tries to hide it,i just smile n watch him trying,lolz|`|ij4iWrUVaa	Girl if it were me,darn i think i'd feel pretty darn good eh.........ha ha.....|`|JnlYIzwdaa	WOW|`|8j7FCEOraa	Hes a boy, and you sound young, him having random hard-ons is totally normal  Especially if he really likes you or your showing alot of skin      He could have some sock shuved in there or something, but I doubt it lol
0fVtHNtmaa	Yes I do|`|PFBKuVhBaa	actually..yes yes i do  :D|`|qGDWbJKpaa	I think he is very sexy. He has muscles too, for an older dude, he has a nice body.|`|yYvFF2fDaa	I think he is... and i'm a lesbian.|`|7sxGW40qaa	He's cute in that I'm-older,-probably-married-but-a-good-f... kind of way.|`|ad7ae5e8f17688d3566fad454e8fc09baa	he's hot, I love him! Nice body for an older man. I always watch celebrity rehab|`|wbkzpYhRaa	Yes, not only because he looks good, but because he is intelligent, dude!  Very mature and has inner strength.|`|yper8qYoaa	No way|`|ktDZjbH7aa	SURE,,,U R,,,,,,PEACE|`|XzjOVaZraa	obviously he is a good looking older man....he is really attractive...have you looked at any other men around his age in your everyday life??? they def don't look like him..|`|j1cyoB2gaa	He is nice looking for an older man, but his knowlege is probably what most people would find attractive.|`|AA10747402	Honestly Dr. Drew is an attractive older man. Now I don't want him in any way because he's to old for me. I'm only 26. But if I were his age I'd find him slightly attractive yes.     But now don' t forget...outward appearance is not all women look for. a guy could be a real stud on the outside but have a personality of a troll and that will make him very un-attractive to a lot of women.|`|63e3Y7zpaa	yes.. i saw him at the university doing some sex discussion.  sexy, smart & successful..  perfect man
1474ddd3aa450daf673bdee63169f0ccaa	If your father is reported, the state doesn't want to take him from the family. But he will have to learn how to treat other with some respect and not hit them in order to live with the family again.  Yes it will be hard for him, but if anyone is really in danger you need some help. Try any church leader first, if they cant get him to stop go the law officers.|`|nJ33E233aa	You need to call the department of children and family services for your sister,lieing is always wrong.|`|ecNeN0staa	I hope he doesn't cook the cupcake and muffin parlor.
OlivXMYmaa	try to get closer to your daughter make her your best freind and thats by telling her stories  abt your day and make talk abt hers and make her feel free to talk abt anything especially bad thing or mistakes that she thinks its not allowed to..and when she does even if you were angry dnt let it show just act like a friend  and advise her in afreindly way with a little joke jst make her feel its ok to make mistakes but she should talk abt them and dont repeat them and DNT PUNISH her!!!and then she will listen to any word you have to say but just keep this relation safe and close and especialy and a parental one but a freindly one and you ll see the result just a matter of time..Be Patient k?|`|oQp9tz6daa	Stalking the other girl, for an age that you aren't sure is true isn't going to help you. I'm seventeen, but I have always looked, and still look much, much older. When any parents or teachers questioned my age or reason for being there, it always ended uncomfortably for both me, the person asking.    If you seriously think though, that the girl is a bad influence, you need to talk to your daughter about it only. Just tell her honestly what you think and what you don't want her to be involved with or who. She'll come around ten times quicker if you are honest and sincere with her, rather than sneaking around behind her back and snooping on someone who could potentially just be a innocent teenage friend.|`|3afb483212e7214e5fd3fcb0bda1cbd1aa	Police department?  School records?  Her parents?    That is all I can think of...    Good luck!|`|bFnpUdikaa	just tell your daughter she can't see her anymore or this may be a little low but if u are desperate. find out your daughter's password for myspace or e-mail and chat with t he frend and ask casually her age|`|QNoZjy9qaa	Talk to your daughter and tell her that you want to know more about her friend's parents. And she is obviously gonna ask u "why" So tell her that because u care about her and the people she hangs out with. Or just straight up tell her that u wanna meet the girl's parents and if your daughter seems like she doesn't want u too then something is wrong. And that's if u wanna meet her parents. It is obviously up to u. Other than that, I would do school or police records. I hope i helped.
NkqiRUgfaa	my idea would be a day at the spa like how you said if shes always busy that would be a good idea for her to relax. My moms around that age and shes always busy i got that for her she loved it. You could also take her out to brunch and spend mother daughter time together.|`|8c56135cd4589e0631905a4f324f3f20aa	Spa gift!  Or go with her to have some time together just you two!    Any mom would love that!!!    Or if she is really busy have something done for her for a month like cleaning or food delivery or flowers something frivolous...pamper her|`|lGS1zOd6aa	a iron and board|`|eCKNRcIVaa	I love Gifts.com because it sort of lets you do a profile on a person and they come up with gift suggestions.  Give it a try.  Also redenvelope is a good site to look at when wondering what to buy.|`|vwcDdNfcaa	my mother also does realastate so i understand  as busy as they are i dont think they relize on all they miss out on so heres some things i did and other ideas get her an adress book, get her a new work outfit, photo album with pics of the family in it or just you two, write her something print it put it on comp paper and fram it then wrap it, go to spa and let her get a massage, GC for her nails or toes, theres so many ideas anything im sure she will love anything from you maybe blow up to photo of you two and get them to write something on the bottom of it from the heart.|`|029366e443f706114f76140b91711233aa	Spa package...excellent idea!!    Lately I thought it would be great to learn a new language...does your Mom have a place where she'd like to travel someday?? If so, maybe you could get her a language lesson set (ie..RosettaStone software). If she'd like to go to France someday...French, Italy...Italian...you get the idea. I thought I might learn Spanish or Arabic.    You sound like a sweet and thoughtful daughter! Have fun! : )|`|nJ33E233aa	Send her a bottle of the newest perfume.|`|UmA4TbDGaa	Send her a care package. with a nice cozy blanket, popcorn bowl, and popcorn|`|LfsBTCk2aa	what i did for my moms bday recently is i went to build a bear...you can do a recording of your own voice that gets stuffed in the bear as well.  its cute and my mom loves it (we dont live together either..im grown)...
KILFoc6kaa	I have no shame in saying most of our clothes comes from thrift stores, and for me also vintage stores.     My husband loves going clothes shopping with me, and I love it.  I want to wear something he will like.  I am a very conservative dresser, and only wear skirts and dresses, so sometimes its nice to have an extra opinion on length of skirts and such, and colors.    My husband has got to be the best shoe shopper in the world, he is amazing at looking at a pair of shoes and naming off the outfits I have at home they would go perfectly with.    Haha... I spend so much money at thrift stores, but WAY less than I would buying retail, I have an obsession and go at least 3 times a week to each of our local ones, and in the summer flea markets, swap meets, and garage sales.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Gawd no... we both hate shopping. And he can care less what I wear.|`|svg71dazaa	My husband hates shopping. He never wants to go with unless it's a 15 minute shop. 1 whole hour is a nightmare for him.|`|i15KoiJhaa	LOL     No, My Husbands idea of "Going shopping with me" is this...    Josh: Do I HAVE to go?!    Me: Yes! Your Mom gave us gift cards for Christmas and we are using them!    Josh: Okay, fine! BUT you have 20 minutes once we are in the door to find what you want and then we are out!    Me: *Eyeball roll*    Then when we get into the store, I go my way (racing) he goes his... 20 minutes later I have some stuff to buy and he is asking me "Babe, what size jeans do I wear?"    LOL He isn't a stylist... he is more of a fashion menace!|`|f572cd9e5284c6c84045096ffbd2aeb8aa	LOL. I think that is cute about your husband picking out awful clothes!   Mine usually has great taste but he haaaates shopping.|`|z0XRuVwSaa	nah my husband has good taste in clothes he has picked few outfits for me|`|NWH3MnE9aa	Hi, raisinette;     What's wrong with hubby being your stylist? By the way -- here: You'd look great in this little chiffon number!|`|77ZVd5hyaa	No my hubby never does that.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	The only time my hubby goes shopping with me is if I really quick pull into the parking lot while we are driving home from somewhere else LOL  Other than that, he tells me "you need a break, ill keep the kids while you go shopping".  He makes it sound like hes trying to be all sweet, but the reality is, he just doesn't want to go!|`|lgxE5nUoaa	My husband enjoys shopping more then most men do.  He actually spends more then me, splurging on whatever he feels like buying in the moment.      He loves it if we go to stores and I try things on - this doesn't happen much because I rarely shop for clothes.      We love going to the malls just to walk around and browse.    He also has a great sense of style - when he needs to dress up for an event, I don't have to help him in any way - it's amazing how well he can pull himself together.  I usually ask him to help me!|`|aXYiOskmaa	are you kidding? my husband can't even dress himself let alone me.|`|agTCqkLDaa	He only gets picky if I wear something out of the ordinary because I usually look really nice and if I get a little too bohemian, he gets funny about it.  I have these brown corduroy pants and he always calls them my "Shaggy pants" as in Scooby-Doo.  Haha.
yuOuoCfDaa	Hmmm good question....I would take that personal.  Seems like his brother had something to do with you not coming.  You can always tell when a family member gives your boy/girlfriend negative advice regarding you because their response is always strange and distant.  That is something you really need to talk to him about because regardless if you have been together for 3 months or three years, its bound to happen again and that is not acceptable.  He doesnt go to bed or share a bond outside of brotherhood with his brother.  I never understand people like that.  Seems like their loyalty to their family is more important than to whom they are with.  Flip the script on him and exclude him from an event that one would deem they should attend.  Then watch his reaction and also his reasoning behind what he did to you intially.  Then the real truth will come out|`|l9gR5lgMaa	don't worry about it. he probably didn't want conflict at the dinner.|`|khye7aEWaa	Well you should bring it up to, him. And if he doesn't like that, then oh well. You just need to tell him how you feel and if he doesn't want to hear tell him you need space.|`|aCaW1vi6aa	I am not sure your question?You mentioned that the brother made an inappropriate comment or did boyfriend? Now are you and bf from different class families,or race,or religion?I am only saying this because he is either looking out for your feelings,or he is just keeping you around for booty call and doesn't want you to be involved with his family and his relationship with them! Or he knows his family will not approve of you and he is trying to keep you out of that whole mess cause he doesn't have the backbone to stand up too them! Either way you need to talk to him about it! Because you could be wasting your time in a relationship that is going no where! Or you may be feeling more for him than he feels for you so you are seeing this as more than he is! Still you need to let him know that this whole thing hurt your feelings and he needs to know that!|`|YYAu9lFDaa	i would dump him, he's not standing up for you.  and that's a big issue!|`|0hSpsSByaa	I think you shouldn't stress over it.  He is probably trying to be considerate of both you and his brother and still have an opportunity to enjoy his company.  If you've only date 3 months, it can't have been that long since your rift.  If you are still seeing each other a year from now and you and the brother have managed to keep the peace, and he still does the same thing, you should ask him why.  But at this point, just let it go.|`|8c56135cd4589e0631905a4f324f3f20aa	Try to be an adult and make the best of things.|`|ygimTNzoaa	If it was dinner with only the brother I'd think they need some brother time, I'd not like it but obviously I can't do anything about it it's his brother. But since the girlfriend is there I would be offended and angry and make it clear to my man. That is little respect if it's not just a private meeting.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	You've only been dating 3 months, just ignore it.  I also think you should keep your eyes open for other available men.  If your already having problems with his family just wait until you get married.|`|8j7FCEOraa	You've only been together for 3 months! Big deal lol  Secondly, have a hear to heart with your boyfriend, and have a heart to heart with your boyfriends brother.  If you want to be apart of the family, you need to act like it.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	This is a tough one. If you don't get along with his brother, then I'm sure thats the reason why you wern't asked. But maybe what he should have done was just invite him and not the brothers girlfriend. Ya now that I think about it>>thats what he should have done. That was a little rude of him.|`|AA11138696	This is petty nonsense.  If you feel upset about this you need a new boyfriend.  3 months is not so long that you should feel insulted if you are not invited to family gatherings.  For all you know his brother is bringing a potential wife to meet the parents.  It is not necessary that you have been invited and it means nothing that you were not.  IF you are offended you are too sensative for this guy, or most of them.  It is not all about you so lighten up|`|1Byis7Flaa	I'd be pissed.  He did not stick up for you to his bro.     Yet runs and goes to hang out with the his bro, and his bro's gf.    I'd be pissed, and encourage him to go live with his bro.    I would not want a woman who took her sisters side over me, in an unfortunate situation. And then especially rather then trying to fix the problem, just remove me from the picture when convenient.|`|8txWayVnaa	Blood is thicker than water, and the two of you haven't been dating all that long.  Your boyfriend is still unsure whether you are a keeper.  Give it some time.  If you are still together in a year, then address the brother issue.|`|uGFzzLYWaa	It seems as if you are being overly sensitive about it. Why are you stressing? Don't make a big deal out of something that isn't a big deal at all. It's not like you're married to him and it's a big family reunion.    He's made plans without you. So what? If you and his brother don't get along, why would you want to go anyway?     Tell him to have a nice time, and make plans for dinner with one of your friends.|`|ByUS0k8waa	You should feel like he is trying to avoid another argument. That is the only reaction to have. I don't see the big deal. If you don't get along with the people why would you want to be invited anyway. Maybe later on when the two of you are about to be married or are married you could be hurt or angry but your not. Also sometimes you want to just spend time with family alone. Without having to worry about something being said or something else to cause issues with family and the two of you.|`|xHxi9p0Vaa	If he has only been you boyfriend for 3 months, and you and his brother have already gone at it, then it is probably a good thing that you didn't go. It sounds like your boyfriend made a smart decision, and probably wants to protect your relationship.
AA10065812	You already have your primary answer.  Contact:  http://www.tferfw.org/html/Home.htm    I'm moving to Austin in a couple of weeks and will be helping work on fathers rights|`|UgcPxd4maa	actually the Cardinals are  2 - GO STEELERS!!!!!|`|ByUS0k8waa	TX says that if its a true 50/50 custody then no child support should be awarded. If you want you can file for it and may get a very small amount but that is a very long shot.|`|pRZ0YviYaa	In Canada, they take how much one parent would have to pay the other and subtract it and that amount goes to the lower income parent.  It's stupid.  There shouldn't be child support since you are ALREADY supporting your child.  Child support in a 50/50 custody situation is really spousal support.  Think about it.
W1rCsvTzaa	I am sorry for you.  If he won't explain why that is just mean.  I actually think he is doing this for a reason.  Are the two of you fighting about other stuff?  What else might this be about?|`|EfBMzCjaaa	no hes simply being stubborn. men are pigs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1    OINK|`|8c56135cd4589e0631905a4f324f3f20aa	Ask him why he doesn't want to go?  Maybe he has some issue with eating in public?    Find someone to be social with you out of the house in a food place!    Go out with someone else then!    Don't get yourself so upset!    Why are you taking care of someone who doesn't even want to make you happy?    Don't waste your time on someone who doesn't love you!    You deserve better!|`|ma6Re8B1aa	NO!!!!!!! Whats wrong with asking him to go out to eat with you????  It's weird he doen't want to????|`|NWH3MnE9aa	Eating out is one of my favorite things.|`|udP6fJ6maa	He is going about it the wrong way, but he probably feels guilty for not bringing in any money and does not want you to have to spend money on him out to eat. Why dont he work?|`|fc1n9vBjaa	Maybe he has a social phobia or something that he hasn't told you about? Who knows. Sit down and calmly ask him to tell you the reason why.|`|e138b4efa4524e74d6719f0ebf966a81aa	deep down he is ashamed that he dont have a income  and is using up your money  he might want to treat you out but cant afford it and feels awkward  why not buy a cook book get some food and both of you clean the kitchen couters off  and cook together it can be very sexual and he might be more intuned to help and have fun  also he might have a fear or fobia i dont eat out and if i do its rare i have issues with kitchens being clean  what not|`|1c98ba0da76082f194ab437ed318f277aa	If your husband is a proud man who recently lost his job, then he might feel weird about going out to eat, and having you pay.    If he has always been a lazy unemployed bum, then I have no idea what his problem is.|`|8txWayVnaa	One word, sweetie:  PRIDE.    You said he's not working. . .He probably doesn't want to go out because he knows he can't pay for it.  Do you throw financial matters (and his lack of contribution) up in his face?  That could be a reason.|`|bZscmV62aa	If its not a money issue, then ask a close friend or family member to go with you instead.   When he is stuck making his own dinner, he will change his mind!|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Like every night?  I don't know...maybe he doesn't care for restaurant food.  My husband doesn't!  He'll go out to eat maybe once a month with us but that's it.  If your husband doesn't want to go - continue to go by yourself if it's that important to you.  Personally - I enjoy fresh, home cooked food myself...healthier for starters...|`|7ewzmiNEaa	Go without him. Find a relative or friend to go.  You are not asking him too much.
vtW3qPZmaa	My cousin owns a few floristry businesses in the UK - she's flying in to do all my flower stuff.  My sister (& MOH) has her own design business so she's in charge of creating the 'look' of the wedding.  Between the 2 of them I'm not too worried about it!|`|76nTvO4iaa	When my daughter got married, she found pictures of "the look" she wanted.    We took them to our florist.  The designer there worked with us to get something close to what DD wanted, would look good at the venue and  used in season (cheaper) flowers.     DD was very happy with the result and was pleased that the designer suggested changes from what she thought she originally wanted.|`|3SSVBJAqaa	I came up with centerpieces of my own. I am alternating between brightly colored flower pomanders and bouquets of light green and white hydrangeas with green hypericum berries. Who says you only have to have one type of centerpiece anyway? As long as they are alternated properly, and place the tables the right way, everything should be perfect.|`|7CKipTZOaa	I would probably search galleries online to find ideas I like then ask a florist to design something similar. I won't be using floral centerpieces, and my boquets are coming from my mother's garden but if I was going to use flowers in the decor yes I would consult a designer|`|agTCqkLDaa	Me, myself, and I.|`|E7LQp6VRaa	I came up with our centerpieces on my own and a cousin who is great at floral arranging is helping me out...    I wanted artificial flowers so that I could keep my bouquet indefinitely and so that I could give the centerpieces away...     Hiring a floral designer is an ok choice but just make sure that it is YOUR vision in the end, not hers...|`|8kdjvWAxaa	My cousin owns a flower shop and she is giving me my centerpieces, boutonnieres, bouquets. Free! So she is helping me with all the flower details and letting me know what flowers are in season and what is not, what would go with the colors perfectly, etc. because i have no clue what i am doing flower wise but i do put my opinion and i am also planning on giving her pictures of which flowers i like.|`|sGP6s7uraa	My florist will be doing the centerpieces and will be supplying the candles and mirrored plates.  We have to come up with the river rocks LOL... (yes, we are "harvesting" our centerpieces in a way).  I'm doing the bouquets, corsages and boutonnieres with the help of some voluntary finger placements.    EDIT - LOL... Thanks.  We've put aside a couple of weekends so far and just walk down the creek together and find our stones.  We have fun :) It's a good time to reconnect while working on the wedding but not necessarily THINKING about the wedding, ya know?|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	I had bigger things to decide on than the centerpieces. Honestly, all flowers are the same to me, as long as they are fresh. I left it completely up to the florist what to do, and I was glad I did. I was perfectly happy with what she suggested.|`|y6gVmhHxaa	I did them myself, I really love to make and put things together though.  If you are short on time and don't feel creative then let a florist do it.  They should have a ton of books you can look through and get ideas then let them run.   Any florist shop can do it, don't feel like you need to pay 3x as much because they call themselves a designer.|`|NmtgziADaa	I don't want a Wedding Planner, So my parents have planted all preannuals in our  back yard so we can snip them the day before the wedding or even the day of and I am going to mix silk flowers with real flowers from our gardens adn make centerpieces. I am only going to a florist for my bouquet because I want a specific one.
0s93q8Ocaa	Guys are like girls.  They check out the girl/guy, go out with that person, maybe fool around a bit to see if there's a spark (or many sparks.)  If there's nothing, then we move on.    It's unfortunate that this happened now, but be glad that he didn't string you along...maybe involved you in a sexual relationship...then drop you like a hot potato.|`|67QVKHQ3aa	maybe hes scared...he probly thinks helikes you to much and doesnt want a commitment....agh men!|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	maybe you should pick up the phone and CALL him! If its that important to you, dont send him a text message!|`|bID1Pd7Gaa	I'm sorry did you say something? I was ignoring you.|`|8pw8qDjPaa	Maybe something happened to him... call him off of someone's else's phone or go by his house and see if he's around.|`|jVRvGDEMaa	maybe you are taking him for granted, you don't want commitment then why are you bothering yourself. Anyway he must be upset with you about something or is busy enough. why don't you meet him in personnel.  Best call him rather than sending text, guys love to test their importance by ignoring their partners.|`|aZsyxJ5Gaa	i cant tell if he likes u or not but at the same time,it doesnt seem like he's playing you but then guys r smart when it comes to playing a gurl...

You said yourself, it wasn't official. Maybe he took heart to that :/|`|oYFicmV8aa	im sorry to hear it but it happens   It's happened to me before too, but how i dealt with it was i deleted his number off my phone so i wouldnt be tempted to contact him. And he eventually did.  To be honest i can't understand why some boys do this but maybe he just wants his space or as harsh as it may sound might have lost interest. However, don't feel bad, i can almost guareentee that if you don't contact him, he will contact u.  Maybe he doesnt like it to get too clingy. My advise is don't let him know it bothers you, i know its hard, but just pretend. He will come running|`|ZrrGygBPaa	SORRY,HE SEEMED NOT INTO YOU.|`|dgbC5Shkaa	Maby he has no credit? XD    Things are probably fine =]  But sometimes your mind just thinks of all the negative things that could be going on so like, your mind might think that he hates you, doesnt want anything to do with you. but infact he probably hasnt got any credit XD Or maby his phone broke or something.    Its happened to me loaaaads. My mind always thinks about the negative reasons.    take care    xx|`|wZvbotxtaa	You need to see the movie " He's just not that into you" and take the author of the books advice...don't waste the pretty!|`|JPXgLx6waa	Well have you been to his place? Maybe something happened to him?|`|YcWGDKvkaa	Maybe he's just confused about your whole "thing" because like you said, you guys aren't exactly dating and after all that cuddling and being close, it's really confusing because he wouldn't know what to do...should he just be friendly about it?or maybe he's confused because like you, he's probably thinking the same thing and the best way for him to think things through is to just be alone for a while.     Sadly, there's a chance that he could be a player and the best bet is to give him the benefit of the doubt and wait for any signs that he is a player. (somehow I doubt he is...)    right now. Maybe you need to think about your feelings for him too., because since you guys aren't officially dating. It's sort of confusing on how you should read all these signs. Should you be a friend? or would you dare to be more?
RvmYqQtRaa	If you can't trust him you mustn't stay. Honesty and trust drive a relationship it sounds to me like you're out of gas. Sorry|`|Sv62SsxXaa	unless you both do some serious work on the relationship, it wont be going anywhere except around and around in a circle.|`|vTkAre7zaa	only time can tell|`|rT7BDLpxaa	First you have to ask yourself does he make you happy when your with him or are you under stress.  Do you feel you have to constantly make him feel good so he will like/love you?  Does he control you?  If you answer yes then seriously consider getting out.  Trust is such an important factor in a relationship that if that's lost never to be regained it's best to bow out of the relationship now.  You'll feel pain but not nearly as much as if you invest more time and the outcome is the same.|`|YGsTYKwNaa	Why did he break up with you? Did u talk about that. Was your relationship bad before the break up? What do you think could be done to make the relationship better and has he really given you a reason to make u not trust him. Ask your self these questions. Does the good outweigh the bad when you think about him. If u love stick it out a little longer and see what happens but if the answers to all these questions arent good ones maybe you should consider leaving.|`|Hwh7Brq9aa	just move on.|`|WV36m31Zaa	what is there to decide . . . no|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	no, I think you should let him go now. You dont trust him, so you cant communicate your feelings with him. If you have no sense of trust, it wont work out. Being in a relationship like that is self-destructive. Be single for a while and try to enjoy all of life's pleasures with your friends and family. Find out who you are and what you want fromlife and a relationship. Next time around, be open with possible boyfriends from the start and explain what you are looking for. Never settle for less than what you need. If you can be friends with this guy, thats great but try to keep him at a distance.
tTLA5CQlaa	I know that this sounds odd.. but my aunt just became a grandma at 44 and she was reluctant to be called grandma. So we came up with  g-ma. Its a little younger and hipper than the traditional grandma or memaw, and with your husband having such a cool name as Pop-Corn, you also need something just as cool.     so think about g-ma,     but mammy is always an option|`|i3pn4jNcaa	i called my older grand-mom grand-mom & my younger one mom-mom. see if that sticks :]|`|boIRASS7aa	Consider MeMaw|`|vqPAZl4Aaa	meemaw, ma2, well he's pop-corn can't you be kernel like a coronel? lol. granna, grammy, Butter? b/c Corn and Butter do go oh so well together!

w5aVE1LUaa	They can tell if your hymen is intact or not, but that doesn't necessarily mean you are or aren't a virgin.    Honestly, it doesn't really matter, they're not gonna tell your Mom. If you tell them not to, they won't.|`|HRJkHuw4aa	yes the doctor can tell, but he isn't obligated to say anything to your mother. in fact you could specifically ask him not to.|`|1JU8gJ7jaa	yeah. the doctor will know.. so your pretty mush SOL.. so tell your mom its better if you tell her rather than finding out from the doc|`|Sv62SsxXaa	maybe, but he cant be certain. you can "pop your cherry" in many more ways then just sexual intercourse. i dont believe theyre allowed to tell your mother regardless however, unless you give your consent.|`|YGsTYKwNaa	Yes. Don't let the doctor be the one to tell your mom. Sit down and say mom can we talk and start from there. Don't be so afraid the deed is done, be open and honest no matter what the reaction. Maybe she won't freak out like u think she might.|`|YiyjU3l4aa	Yes, honey.  The doctor will be able to tell.  Women have a ring of tissue around the vaginal opening called the hymen which is meant to protect the vagina until you have intercourse.  This will have been broken (aka "popped cherry"), and the doctor will easily be able to see this.      However, as part of the Hippocratic Oath (the oath all doctors must take prior to becoming a doctor), doctors promise that, "Whatever, in connection with my professional service, or not in connection with it, I see or hear, in the life of men, which ought not to be spoken of abroad, I will not divulge, as reckoning that all such should be kept secret."  This means that, unless you tell your doctor otherwise, he/she cannot tell your mom anything about your health.      Though I definitely recommend telling an adult that you do trust enough (maybe an accepting aunt or teacher) about your sexual activities, you can ask your mom to wait outside the exam room, and make sure you tell your doctor that she isn't to be told anything, just in case.    I reiterate, however, you do need to tell an adult that you trust what's going on.  Trust me when I tell you, it's so much easier to deal with this confusing life when you can confide in someone who's been there and won't judge you.    Good luck, dear.|`|AA11370170	yes mame. she will. she will know if you have had intercourse becasue your cherry is not there anymore. her job is to know the female vagina niside and out. when i lost my virginty i told my mother because she loves me and wants the best for me...please talk to her about it becaue like my mother she might be surprisngly understanding.

7fYVdSKaaa	It was really sweet of you to bump back your date for her, but it sounds like she doesn't have the same self-sacrificing instinct you do. The role of maid of honor is different to every bride: some just want someone to show up and hold her bouquet, and some want a gal to be an on-call personal assistant. Maybe your friend thinks that this title doesn't entail as much as you want it to, and in that case, you might want to gently tell her that it's a stressful time for you and you need her, pregnant or not, to help with a few specific things.   If your friend would be inclined to dodge you or make assumptions about you even if she wasn't pregnant, maybe you should bump her down to bridesmaid and find a new MoH. It always sucks to put more into a friendship than another person, especially if you're doing in the context of your wedding.   If she's worth pursuing as a lifelong, close friend, honesty is key. You can tell her that you're both going through a stressful time and you want to make it as easy on her as possible, but she accepted a role in your wedding that requires her to put in a little more effort.   If you regret seeking her out again and feel so alienated that you might not ever get over those feelings, I'd get rid of her and find someone who cares more.   Good luck!|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	she might feel you weren't being a good friend because you wouldn't go into the exam room with her.    Sounds like you have a lot of expectations that you aren't communicating to her and she is just breezing along thinking everything is fine.    TALK TO YOUR FRIEND!  Ask her how she's doing.  Ask her how the pregnancy is going.  Then bring up your concerns.  If you don't even have a wedding date yet (you said sometime in June, July, or August) then why do you need a bridal shower planned yet?  Bridal showers are usually a week or 2 before the wedding.    calm down, take a few deep breaths and talk to your friend and tell her what you would like.    you don't have enough info to decide if you need a new MOH or not yet.|`|HRJkHuw4aa	you should talk to your friend about this, if I were you I would just plan on doing everything your self and if you get help then great if not no big deal. I would never have put off my wedding date for anyone, friend or not,|`|60a3bbdca78e74fb19db426e27b9a087aa	Se might not be being your friend right now, or she might just be too wrapped up in her own life that she can't give you the time you need.    Ask her if it would be better for her if you asked someone else. That way you aren't just dropping her but giving her a graceful exit.|`|LOQMQU8Saa	I think you should keep her a bridesmaid. You obviously care about her a lot as a friend.  I'm sorry to say this, but you are a bit at fault in this. You did a bit too much by delaying your wedding date, and I guess you were expecting as big efforts on her part in return. But not everyone has the same expectations and views on friendship.  I think you should put less hopes in relationships and take it as it comes. You should still make efforts into making bonds stronger, but not ones that would bring you discomfort.|`|3DF7X1mhaa	WOW!  This is tough. You both are going through stages in you life that are both equally exciting and important. That being said I think that it may be a good idea not to include her in the bridal party. She has a lot going on, as do you, and you need someone that is going to be enthusiastic and truly happy about helping you plan this joyous occasion. That does not apply only to her it applies to everyone that you have around you during this time.     If I may draw from a personal experience, my sister's wedding party was very small. She and her husband had a maid of honor (me), best man, flower girl, and ring bearer. She did that for this exact reason. She wanted to include people that where going to be truly happy for her and relieve some of the stress not add to it!     I wish you the best, because you deserve it!|`|itbkP9HGaa	Although you are getting married, and this is a truly momentous occasion for you, this is not the same experience for everyone else in your life.  You seem about as excited about her new baby as she is for your wedding.  I'd say you're both on even ground.    Sure, it would be nice if your bridal party could be there to help you plan things.  But ultimately, that's not what its all about.  Otherwise you'd just hire a wedding coordinator and make her your bridesmaid, right?    My maid of honor was my sister, and she was 19 so she didn't do anything at all to help plan or host any showers or parties.  Did I care? No. She was my maid of honor because of how much I love her, and because I wanted her by me on my wedding day.  My bridesmaids were all out of state and did nothing as well.  Again, that's not why I chose them to be my bridesmaids.    Look at the bigger picture, and show some maturity.|`|el9wtu9Uaa	No|`|jgw1buUAaa	I have someone who is the same way. It's almost as if you are a 2nd rate friend to her; meaning that if her other friends aren't available, she calls you. Personally, as hard as it may be, i wouldn't make her your maid of honor. It sounds like you are just making her the maid of honor out of principal.  You probably have much better friends than that so i would pick one of them to be the maid of honor and make her a bridesmaid. That way, she is still included in the wedding party so she feels special but you have someone you deserve to help you plan the important things. After everything with the wedding is over, maybe then you could bring up the fact that she is treating you like a 2nd rate friend. I hope that helps you. That's what i did and it worked out wonderfully. :)
8pw8qDjPaa	It sounds like love.     As long as you need him because you love him... not love him because you need him. You always need to be able to be independent and support yourself.

AA10916001	If you want to live in the stone ages and have a man have to always pay for everything when you are perfectly able to contribute to the costs, I suggest you date another caveman and leave this financially saavy man to a woman who will appreciate him.     Are you implying that if you get married the man has to pay for everything and you get to keep any of your money for your own selfish wants?    You are NOT a princess to be pampered...you are just another woman here on this earth. It is time to grow up, dear. If you want a man to always take care of you, perhaps you should just stay home with daddy. There are plenty of self sufficient women who would appreciate your man.    This is the 21st century. Welcome.|`|jfwmelYgaa	Reminiscent of George from Seinfeld.|`|S9bEtVCSaa	I understand completely - my bf is just like that. I was so used to being treated all the time - I formed this "diva" complex. The very first time he and I went out for dinner I offered to  pay my half (that's a little something I've always done just to test the guy) HE LET ME PAY MY HALF!!!   I was so mad - then I realized he is just really cheap - we'll call him frugal. I'm with him now (almost 3 years) and I'm glad he's cheap. Because of him we're getting a house in December, we have brand new furniture, a new TV, I have a new car, etc. So - it's a blessing in disguise.|`|HRJkHuw4aa	he isnt stingy or cheap, he probably just doesnt have alot of money.

I sorta go with the concept that if it's his idea, he pays; if it's your idea you pay; and if it's just a casual "let's go out!" from both sides, then split it.|`|BcrYBSJmaa	It's difficult because feminists say they want to be treated equally, but then complain that a man isn't a gentleman if he doesn't offer to pay. Personally, I do think it's polite for the man to offer to pay, but just because he doesn't, it doesn't mean you can't have a nice relationship with him.|`|u70TaWI5aa	I always pay when I am out with a lady, that is just my nature. But I hate it when woman assume that I am paying. I like it when they at least offer, at least it shows that they care.

I am used to paying for my half... this isn't freaking 1950.|`|k4fd4jnjaa	Just imagine how it would be if you married him!! He is cheap. I could image if it was every other date,but come on. If you really like him then ask him If he wouldn't mind paying for every other outing. Chances are this will get old real quick for you. Go get pampered-you deserve it!!|`|395c377076280782e3d71dbcfe6ad589aa	Sweetheart, its time to hit the highway, i mean, why should you split bills with a boyfriend. Society since the age of my grandfather has always stated  that men should take care of women, so if  he cannot do that, why waste your time thinking about it whereas you can meet guyz ready to treat you like the queen you are?    No romance without finance! They say only bitches say that, but its better to be one than split dinner bills with a man!!!|`|ab01551f60d9bedfb7b67497fae0953daa	let him pay or send him on his way.|`|Z5amlOkAaa	yes  unless things are really serious   you should split things|`|0s93q8Ocaa	If a person doesn't meet your expectations and you're not willing to compromise, then it's time to move on.     He may be cheap, or just testing to see how high maintenance you are.    He's looking out for his interest.  You should do the same with yours.|`|YVO3WyU1aa	Ah yes, you cry for equality, but when you get it, you don't get it.  You might want to consider why you have so many ex's.|`|UrMqFBjbaa	maybe he is a greedy person and probaly he has millions of dollars hiding in right in his pockets|`|Hwh7Brq9aa	i think your just expecting too much, wots to stop you from payin? exactley!! Half is better then all of it so i wouldnt complain so much if i was you.|`|YcWGDKvkaa	I thought it was normal for guys and girls to split up. But in a way, I understand how you feel...it's great to be pampered and guys should never forget to treat a girl from time to time! however, maybe you'll get used to it because it's probably a new thing for you but it's not so bad. Sometimes a guy whose stingy is really annoying! but as long as your having fun it doesnt matter.

Yg2iIneKaa	love is un conditional.|`|eCKNRcIVaa	Yes I believe all love is conditional except maybe the love between a parent and child|`|8txWayVnaa	Are you asking about unrequited love?  Or unconditional love?  Because I'm confused.|`|QTiTDz4yaa	In order for it to be a healthy working relationship..yes.    In order for it to be extremely unhealthy and self abusive..no.|`|dKkFdVpvaa	You can love, maybe like or even enjoy is a better word, someone  who doesn't love you back.     It's usually a crush!    However, I wouldn't go telling that person, I love you everyday or even at all... this usually ends in arrest!    After all, The Good Book does to love your enemies!|`|JKuTvdfeaa	you get what you give.|`|VNum3TKyaa	It shouldn't be but sadly sometimes it is.
vTvsgVJiaa	Yes he is.  You need to explain to him that he can be a father figure, but this child has a biological father as well and you can't prevent your ex husband from seeing and caring for his own child.  Say that you don't love him any less and the child will have plenty of love for both of them, but he needs to understand that he will have to be more understanding about the situation.  Just because your ex husband bought some gifts doesn't mean your boyfriend can't!!  I bet he is just feeling slighted and left out, so try to make him a bigger part of the pregnancy and the child's life and he will come around soon enough!|`|LV9l8EFkaa	man you bang em out dont ya|`|9e27b32bc3fee1168b70cd3e85c70c90aa	he is overreacting, he needs to understand that he isnt the father and that your ex will always be around for his child.     i know he wants to be a father figure to this child, but your ex is the real daddy and he has to understand this!|`|FyhzmgRUaa	yes he is overreacting.|`|aRP51lSyaa	Yes because the blood father has every right to buy his OWN child presents if he wants, your bf can't stop that especially if the father is going to be persistent about it.|`|b3zGfYMpaa	Your ex is the father of this baby whether your boyfriend likes it or not. No one will take the place of your soon to be son's biological father, but thats not to say your boyfriend cant and wont be a big part in his life. I think its good that your ex is giving gifts for the baby, some father's dont want anything to do with their children and offer no support or help in caring for it, your a lucky woman and I wish you all the luck. Talk to your boyfriend and help him understand this.|`|8pw8qDjPaa	yes. it is your ex's baby whether your boyfriend likes it or not. and while your boyfriend can try and be a father figure in your child's life, your ex has every right to love and raise his children as well... you might be doing most of the work to have the kid, but it is also your ex's responsiblity because without him there wouldnt be a kid. i think your boyfriend is more insecure about you and your ex over your ex being a father to his own kid. but he could also be jealous you have all these kids with your ex and none with him. hard telling.|`|JwnHKTabaa	He's way overreacting.  He needs to take a chill pill, seriously.|`|57af3cd106168b01009e4dbbc6d55acbaa	Yes|`|tU7JVMinaa	your ex-husband is the babies daddy, your bf being a little stupid, your ex is still and always will be the farther as long as he cares about the baby.|`|uIg6an6Jaa	yea its your exs child|`|klzmFfjZaa	Yeah. The baby isn't his child and your ex is. The father is always supposed to buy his child things.|`|eM8dg4knaa	Personally, I think he's overreacting. He's not the real father and is never going to be and he should face that. You ex husband is just trying to be nice. He can still buy gifts himself for you and your unborn baby. Talk to him about it.|`|rvviZvOSaa	Of course, tell him that buying gifts won't make your ex the real father. Being next to you makes it.    If it's really about being competitive (oh...men!!) suggest him to buy something even nicer, something that you really need...|`|DtEjIcIbaa	Yes.  Your ex has the right to his child, its not your bfs.   Hope its all ok!|`|JPXgLx6waa	Love, you can't shut your child father away. To hell with your boyfriend, you child need HIS father not some stranger not related to him. It's not a good idea to let this "boyfriend" of your become the father figure. Children need their REAL father just as they need their mother.|`|RfwOQUPGaa	I think he's jealous.  I doubt he is overreacting, he just wants raising the baby to be something you do together!  It's like eastenders with sean, roxy and their baby.  Then again, it's you ex-husbands baby, so, i don't know, your boyfriend might just have to get used to the idea that your ex-husband might be helping more often.  They should both be father figures!! :)|`|LSqHgFBDaa	yes he is overreacting|`|UgcPxd4maa	yes he is overreacting. That baby is the other mans child and he has every right to want to be in its life an buy it things.|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	your boyfriend needs to understand that you have 7 children with this man. He is the kids' father weather your boyfriend likes it or not. If you allow your children to see thier biological father and you get child support from this man, he will always be a part of your life. It was kind and thoughtful for your ex to buy a babyshower gift. If you dont want your ex to be part of your kids' lives anymore, it needs to go to court and your bf should stay out of it until its settled. If you allow your kids to see him and your bf tries to intervene, he needs to hit the road. He needs to understand that he can never replace a true father.|`|6zVISNTZaa	A little bit, yes. Explain to your boyfriend that your ex-hubby is the biological father and he can't stand in the way of that. However explain that your boyfriend can be a fatherly figure to your baby, but he can't expect to be "Dad" as that resides in your ex-husband as it sounds like he wants to be involved with his child.|`|QLPyLRrDaa	He's definitely overreacting, the father of your child to be and your six other children is doing what he can to provide for you and his unborn child. Your boyfrirnd should be greatful that your ex hubby still wants to help support you.|`|KXmcx8sRaa	YEA! YOUR EX IS JUST TRYING TO BE THOUGHTFUL AND NICE!  WHAT A JERK OF A BF YOU HAVE! I'D DUMP HIM! WHAT A WASTE HE MUST BE!  he sounds like the type who just bosses you around. you can't let him think that you still have a relationship with your ex! what a *****
iJqYC0vkaa	The first thing that has me worried is the suicide comment. seek help.  but as far as the kids, As a step-mom of 20 years now with a jealous ex-wife ignore her. As long as your home is happy who cares. Now my step-son now 26, called me when his child was born than a week later he called his real mom because I pestered him enough. Kids know who love them and who care. I am not a step anything really. When I married my hubby it was a package deal. If the real mom doesn't want help she is nuts. Because it truly does take a village to raise a child. A child can not have to many eyes, or hands watching it as it grows though life. Especially in today's world.|`|nJ33E233aa	Do what feels right in your heart,in the long run their mother will appreciate it, maybe not as soon as you would like.|`|lYZ71zYAaa	Have you had this conversation with your husband? Does he know how you feel? What you do with the children while they are in your care is really none of her business, unless you are hurting her children which I doubt. Just because your not a biological mother doesn't prove that you can't take care of children, It comes naturally to most women, It is what feels right at the time, on how to care for them. How would the children feel if you harmed yourself? That is no solution to your problem, You need to have a serious talk with your husband , he needs to talk to his ex wife, and tell her to chill about you, You have been married long enough and have been around those kids to know how to take care of them. I'd tell her to mind her own business while you and your husband have the children in your care. Just do what is in your hart when it comes to those kids. Love them and take care of them.
el8yX5q3aa	you don't see a guy for a long time and when you do see him he tries to have sex with you?      It is an uncomfortable situation  You want to be interested and you aren't ...he wants to and he doesn't want to.....    The communication isn't there...  because what you both feel can't be talked about.  Something isn't right and if it was you two would be together now.    I say move on.....this relationship is too confusing ...he doesn't want to talk about it....so stop trying.    EDIT..    After reading your edit...he rubs your butt when you are sleeping?  what is going on?  GET AWAY FROM THAT IDIOT....I can't see why you can't see this guy is bad news....    good grief...anyone who rubs someone's butt while they are sleeping is abusing them.  and why you didn't open your mouth and say something or kick him in the nuts is beyond me.  If you can't stick up for yourself...tell your dad what is going on and let him kick his azz.|`|GWmkKF5jaa	I've noticed American men take rejection very very very harshly.

HES JUST NOT THAT IN TO YOU!!|`|3aWASsCXaa	it sounds as though he did like you at one point. he would not be defensive about this subject if there was no feelings from his side. however, it also seems like he is trying to avoid these feelings. if you cannot ask him directly, the only thing you can do is look for clues whilst trying to get him to like you.|`|I9mEKOhVaa	the guy is afraid to be turned down the 2nd time, it looks like he wants to hang out with you and afraid to tell you his real feelings.  He is afraid that if he gets turned down again you will feel uncomfortable again like last time and will he will loose your closeness.      my suggestion tell him how you feel in a letter  and in the letter put at the end " if I am wrong about your feelings just disregard this letter and we can still continue to be friends"    the worst thing is to ask your self 2-5 years from now "What If"        Just a thought.... hope it helps

Its human nature to be unsatisfied with our surroundings. Its part of life. You just have to accept it. Deep down inside, we know there are good guys out there. We just don't know where to find them.

ma6Re8B1aa	Sweetheart>>CALM DOWN. It's probably nothing serious at all. It's probably because he didn't eat and it was hot in there. Thats all it probably was. it happens sometimes to us all. Everything will be ok alright. It's nice you worry about your husband so much. But take some deep breathes. I'm SURE he's fine. Just needs some food and water in him. tell him to EAT!!! OH one more thing. Ignore some of these IDIOTS on here with the wiseas* answers.

I work for cardiologists (heart doctors) and normally, the first thing they have someone do when they feel dizzy is to increase their fluid and salt intake but that's after the doctors see them.  I'm not recommending he do that on his own.  I'm just saying it may just be as simple as that and most times, that's all it is in our patients.  Still, a checkup can't hurt.  It could have been low blood sugar.  There are a lot of very simple explanations it could have been without it being a big deal so I wouldn't get too worried until you get to the doctor, okay? Good luck to you and him and I hope everything turns out okay!!!|`|fc1n9vBjaa	If you don't eat and are in a warm environment it's not uncommon at all to get dizzy, that's nice that you care about him so much but I don't think you have anything to worry about. Unless it happens continually. If you're still worried ask him to speak to his doctor to give yourself peace of mind but it's most likely nothing at all.

Good luck, and God bless|`|lsFDEx2oaa	Just because the first cut is the deepest, that doesn't mean the others don't hurt.  Cat Stevens understands your pain.      To put it bluntly, if you are putting all your eggs in one basket and expecting things to work out like a fairy tale, yes you are bound to get hurt because it's not reality.      While things are good, men will say and do most anything because they are happy.  As soon as things get too real or too comfortable, a lot of men start to freak out.  They feel suffocated.  They feel guilty.  Eventually, they flee.      Also, if you allow them to treat you like garbage, you become garbage.  Self esteem and confidence is a must for anyone.    You will meet a guy who won't hurt you eventually, but the thing you have to do is first heal.  Then stay out of relationships for awhile, that is the common factor here.  Learn some independence, date around.  Have some fun.  When you have fun, the picture becomes clearer, ex's fade into the background.  Good luck.|`|AA10986891	It sounds like things started moving to fast for him and he freaked out and did the first thing he thought run and hide.

Remember this. They will only hurt you if you allow them to. Not by giving your heart. By all means, the key to happiness is falling in love. But when he does break your heart, pick yourself up. There are a million fish in the sea. Dive back in. I know how you feel. I was in this INCREDIBLE relationship for four years. Then he left me to find God. Out of nowhere. I didn't date for two years. I gave up two years of my life to be alone and miserable. Don't put yourself through that. The perfect guy is out there somewhere. You may not even know he is the perfect guy for you when you first meet him. It may take years to realize he is the one.

No man is promised to us even when whe get married there still not promised to us because we are human.  You need to focus on what is important which is yourself.  I know this seems kind of ironic to say but you say that people have called u attractive.  Just because a guy breaks your heart or treats you like **** does not mean ur ugly.  It has nothing to do with looks.  Look at Hally Berry Christy Brinkley all these beautiful women have been hurt by some loser housband or boyfriend.  Belive me the situation that ur in has nothing to do with you, its all him.  I don't belive that every guy your going to date is going to break your heart but when you are in the dating game thats the chance that you take. Focus on youself and your job and if any man has something negative to say about what ur doing with ur life then they don't deserve U anyway. Tell yourself every day that u are all that and a bag of chips and that u are a diva!!!|`|8emYO8DFaa	24 years of age is young.... I can guarantee you that, you still have not experienced a real relationship. The most recent man you speak of has doubts for one reason and one reason alone. He is asking himself, Will this relationship last? The number one reason Men today won't commit is that we are afraid of a failed marriage.     Now, to answer your question, will all men hurt you? The answer depends on what type of men you choose. I know men who would never hurt a women in their entire life, and I know men who would hurt women.|`|a7u3RZYJaa	well no not every man will  hurt u just the dick heads|`|ruczpWrGaa	no they wont.  its just a matter of finding what is right for you.  If dating and relationships were easy then we wouldn't have speed dating and dating services and personal ads and all that just.  you will be fine. just give yourself time and just enjoy life because life is an adventure.
ReJrLxh7aa	you want someone to text you? you might not get the attention you are looking for.. Yahoo Answers is to try to help you if you have an issue or question... otherwise i would not give my number out to strangers. besides you sound young. please becareful.     If the guys that are texting you have girlfriends you should probably not talk to them beyond a friendship conversation. All you can do is tell your girlfriends your real intentions and if they do not want to believe you they might not be your real friends.|`|RZfoszJFaa	what did you do|`|MYbRICxqaa	What is wrong? You can not worry about others. There comes a time where there is only you.|`|3MEQeHtWaa	this is pathetic.|`|RwlaVgqvaa	don worry|`|i6ZR1y1naa	why they didnt talk to you ???
dFwwCxKYaa	Let her read your book. Gary Chapman also has other books available. Check at your local Christian supply store. Good Luck!|`|lGS1zOd6aa	penthouse|`|d5368f798fac0323fe025ec0d32f5be6aa	that is probably the best book. just gotta make sure she reads it and not just scrim through it or skip parts. Try going to a seminar sometime.    Men just want respect and girls just want love and to feel loved.    My love language is Touch and Quality time.  Hers are words of Affirmation and i completely suck at it!|`|9xgGd9praa	What the hell are you talking about?|`|7sxGW40qaa	Try the Gary Chapman thing, it seemed to work for you.|`|0rt5oCQCaa	give her the one u got????|`|ktDZjbH7aa	WHY NOT YOURS??"THE FIVE LOVE LANGUAGES",,SHE MIGHT REALLY GET INTO IT,,CAUSE YOU LIKE IT SO MUCH,,,,PEACE|`|pGsVIqdyaa	what the hell you talking about wud help if you gave more info|`|ab01551f60d9bedfb7b67497fae0953daa	"The Five Love Languages for Dummies" by Gary Chapman's cousin.|`|qegWdsNLaa	Maybe Gary Chapman's, "The Five Love Languages"!
brd9Z8VRaa	yes, this is very true. I've been in a relationship where I was VERY un-happy with myself and didn't like anything going on in my life, EXCEPT the fact that I had a boyfriend. At that point, I relied on him to bring me happiness and fullfill my needs. That never happened and obviously I should have never been with someone in hopes of them solving my issues. Now that I've accepted myself and who I am, I have no problems meeting men/dating and things seem to go smoother and I'm less stressed out or un-happy because I'm at peace with myself and it's usually a turn on for guys when girls are happy with their life and self. Also, I am able to help others more now that I've helped myself. : )|`|WyCmQBuvaa	100% yes|`|FxpE8ivMaa	yes I do cuz if you're not confident or happy with yourself physically or emotionally. you may seem cold or mean or arogant. but if you are happy with yourself, it's easy for people to see the good in you and you will attract more people  (potential lovers) because of your positive vibe.|`|jFFNm9eYaa	yes
qmSDWteDaa	it hard trying to get over some you loved over tree months but it will all be over with in time just be timeful in what your going to do but dont show him that your weaker then he is just look as joyful as you can that will make him regreat that he broke up whith you.now make him suffer.|`|hazucBxbaa	best thing to do is let him go, if he comes back to you, then its meant to be, because was meant to be will find its way, if not then move on he just isnt the one if it doesnt work out|`|HRJkHuw4aa	give the guy his space, let him bring his grades up. he is being responsible. just be glad its only been three months and not three years.|`|55bf89b95658e65af7827cede5ad23b6aa	Do you SERIOUSLY believe this:    "He says he's failing because all he can do is think about me and skips his homework to talk to me"    COME ON! Read that one in 15 years and you'll feel pretty stupid for saying you understand!     Seriously.    Just chalk it up and he didn't feel like spending money on you for Valentines Day.    There's other fish in the sea honey! And they DON'T make up crappy excuses like THIS one does!|`|mSedRDDsaa	Then let it go because he wants to get good grades so that he can go to college! You'll be fine but I'm sorry that you guys broke up.|`|vTkAre7zaa	get over it|`|UrMqFBjbaa	seriously he IS cheating on you he's with another girl.|`|AA11370170	im sorry bit you will get through it i know it.. sometimes thigns happen for a reason and we cant control them,.. good luck
J1rrfQk0aa	He should have called you to follow up, but the phone does work both ways. Perhaps if you had called him to let him know you were still waiting for confirmation on his ticket. However, with only 4 days to go until the event, I can understand him not wanting to miss out by having your plus one not pull through. It should have been handled differently though yes, communication is key :)|`|YZ4ozLyyaa	ah well lifes too short to get annoyed  just shake it off  enjoy yourself|`|AA10747402	you have every right to feel the way you're feeling, but, in this case I think I'd just be glad he at least called you and told you he'd see you there. Now he knows for sure that he'll be able to go and you all can hang out for sure.I'd let the small stuff roll right off you and have a good time. :o)|`|AA10628838	Absolutely. How rude. It really makes no sense for him to accept the other invite after you already inviting him.|`|UDX3qgy5aa	maybe, he should have waited for you but seeing as this other invitation was certain it was fair enough    depends how you look at it  tell him how you feel
sJ4swVwHaa	tell her how you feel and see what happens<br>  or just ask her if she likes the guy shes been hanging out with if she says yes maybe she just wants to be good friends|`|VP2T5LeHaa	look. i know you cant let her go and you shouldnt. <br>  <br>  dont tell her your feelings quite yet. instead of a hug just give her a goodnight kiss. see her reaction. then when you feel comfortable and you think she is comfortable, tell her. <br>  <br>  its your job to drop hints also to show her your interested|`|u2lYbPT2aa	You both need to communicate!!  Sounds to me like you both are very good friends! What better than to be friends first??  It could grow into  a wonderful relationship!! Try not to be jealous, for that just poisons a relationship!!  My best to you! xoxoxo|`|6a221e63714f9d33724ccb40cd162c0aaa	This girl sounds great. She probably likes you but wants YOU to make the first move, meaning she is deliberately giving you clues and hopes you'll make a move soon. Don't be afraid! If you don't make a move, you'll regret it for the rest of your life...you may miss out on your only one :P Ask her out to the movies, or something one on one. If she says no, you can still be friends. Go for it!|`|HmAVSNe6aa	idk about this girl. she seems like a player, but if u feel she really likes u then ask her before someone else does. ;)|`|f8F5kfHVaa	JUST ASK HER!! if u like her tell her she wont wait forever|`|qq84piBLaa	Seems to me that she likes you to and shes scared to make a move also..so i think you should go for it|`|yHsXAlP8aa	Communication is essential to successful relationships. It's important you let her know how you feel for her and see if there is any common ground. If you're both not heading in the same direction, don't invest your emotions into it. It won't benefit you or her, and will only make you miserable.
I51D6slHaa	They are detailed and the girls worry if it looks like them.|`|KonX926jaa	well i don't know<br>  but thank you for the compliment tho<br>  i just designed mine for a reason to....<br>  and avatars have to look "good" in some way ugly or pretty when piking the right outfit, face, hair, etc. so any avatar is gorgeous!<br>  ;D|`|g9RQ7ediaa	they're so attractive because they are not real .If you think cartoons are good looking I THINK you might need a real woman or you ARE lame ..lol (dont worry .I expect to get WORST answer..)
