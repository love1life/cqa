20070716182315AA5RB4A	Business & Finance;Investing	Is everybody aware of the power of leveraged index funds?	I know, I know, the old mantra says that leveraged funds (whether they be 1.5X, 2X or 2.5X the market index) work both ways: yes, it can make you extra money (if the market shows positive returns), but it can also lose you extra money (if the market shows negative returns).      I've done a little experimenting and I've found that whatever time frame you're looking at, if the period annualized positive returns for the market (and it is hard, perhaps impossible to find any 15-year period where this didn't happen), any leveraged fund makes a GREAT DEAL more than a regular index fund.      From 1950 to 2006, $10,000 in the S&P 500 realizes $628,744.20 in gains.  With a 1.5X leveraged fund, $2,818,647.36!  And here's the whopper: with a 2.5X leveraged fund, that $10,000 turns into $17,411,902.42!!!       I always thought leveraged funds expose you to extra volatility, and nothing else.  I assumed that leveraged and non-leveraged funds arrived at that same point in the future.  They don't!

20070630111033AAiJLCR	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Can we break our lease and still get our security deposit back?	Our landlord has now decided to sell the house we live in.

She keeps saying that if she does have a buyer she'll give us at least 3 months notice, but we don't know if we believe her. We've found a really good deal on a new place already. I've read our lease several times and it says nothing about her trying to sell the house. Is there anything in Florida renters/tenant law that says if she's selling that we can just go if we find an oppurtunity, or do we have to stick it out until November, or when she finally sells?

20090128152234AAjVR30	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Confused about SBBT's refund status?	I am suppose to have my refund DD into my account on Friday. The IRS website says so (and we know how accurate that was today). Anyways, I checked SBBT and seen the following:   Income Tax Refund Status      The IRS issues refund deposits each Friday, so your delayed deposit may not arrive until the following Friday. You may visit www.irs.gov to check the status of your refund.      The IRS did not deposit funds to your account as originally expected. The IRS usually makes refund deposits within 9 to 16 days, but your deposit was not received within that period of time. At times the IRS will delay a refund deposit by one week, so you may check back at this site seven days from now. If no deposit is made by then, you should contact the IRS. For more information on the status of your refund, we recommend you visit the IRS website at www.irs.gov and select the "Where's My Refund?" link. Thank you.      I called SBBT and spoke to a representive who said it was still set for Friday, plus their automated phone system says the same. Anyone use them last year and get this message and still get their refund as it was suppose to be? Anyone have any ideas here?

He has been living out of India for the last three decades.  Average one to two times in a year he visits India.  He has no income in India but he has some properties - some he got from parents and some he bought himself in his own name long ago with his own savings.   As he has no any income in India, he has never filed any income tax returns though he has PIN from income tax deptt.  Since he has got some properties, he may sell these properties which may or may not show income,  please advise if he needs to file Income Tax returns or not.  If yes, why and if no, why?  These answers are very important and should peferably be replied by some experienced people, having similar experiences in life.  Also, kindly advise if he can buy a property in his minor (PIO) child or not.  Pleast, go through my question closely and seriously as I am looking for a serious and matured reply, preferably, from experienced Indians, residing overseas for long time and preferably, facing similar situation.

I'm 22 years old, and about to apply for my absolute dream job, but i have a problem.      I saw the job advertised in a national newspaper (online version), and e-mailed my CV, with a very brief note attached.       However, i have now discovered who the job is for (in the newspaper, it was directed to a job agency who would forward the details on), and went onto their website. On their website, they list a few extra skills that i would need, and i have all those skills, but because they were not mentioned in the newspaper advertisement, i didn't put them down in my CV. Also, they said please attach a covering letter about why you want this job etc, but my additional note/covering letter was extremely brief.       I want to send my CV directly to the company, rather than through the newspaper and job agency, because it would be better than the earlier one i sent. However, would sending 2 CV's in, one with a better covering letter, mean that they would get annoyed and not consider me.       What would be your advice? Should i leave it as it as, or go ahead and send them my reworked CV.

Have just started collecting unemployment (Pennsylvania) and was offered an independent contractor opportunity that is strictly commission.  Will earning one or two commissions jeapordize my unemployment status?  I would like to try the job but am scared that making one or two commissions will make me ineligible to collect unemployment and that if I can't make enough to sustain my household, I will be screwed.  Please let me know if there is a way around this, I would like to be able to collect unemployment (for my designated weeks) when I don't make commission, but I'd like to try my hand at the job to see if I can make it.

20090128194156AAzycdF	Business & Finance;Taxes;Australia	As an American working in Australia, what are the US taxes like on Australian earned income?	I'm thinking about a fixed term position of up to three years in Australia and am concerned about being double taxed by both the Australian government and the US. The US tax code is notoriously arcane. I've read what seems like the most relevant parts but that hasn't instilled confidence in my conclusion that as long as I pay more taxes in Australia than I owe in the US, that I will be exempt from owing taxes to the US. Is this so?      I collect no dividends or have income from interest and I am single with no dependents.

Say on the website that FHA will approve multi family properties.  My loan officer said that the loan would not be approved because it is a multi family property.  The FHA appraiser had no issue.  Is it up to the lender on whether they will allow it or not?  Why would a lender deny this?  Putting 20% down and the property is very profitable and it will be considered my primary residence as well.  Not sure why the loan did not go through.  Thanks in advance
