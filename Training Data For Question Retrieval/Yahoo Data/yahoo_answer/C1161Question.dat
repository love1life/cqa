I went to a salon over the weekend... i had medium brown hair & was looking to get highlights of blonde.. platinum.. the stylist for some reason did not use bleach but just a lifter so my hair turned orange & the highlights were horribly spaced far from eachother far from the roots... everything! so I went home.. and dyed it brown again so it looks okay still a little brassy... so I'm wondering to keep my hair in good health when would it be ok to dye it again? I just want it darker for now.. Im giving up on being blonde.       thank you!

Well I've purchased a good amount of Steve Madden shoes in the past, ranging from sandals to flats to boots. In total I've realized that the quality of SM shoes is pretty bad. The heels fade away quickly, and the tips get easily scratched. I now have small holes at the tips of my SM boots!  In 1 or 2 months, it looks like I owned them forever. They are not sturdy at all! For the sandals, the sole changes color and they look worn out pretty quickly. I now vow not to buy anymore SM shoes, as I feel they are not worth the money.      So what do you think of the quality of SM shoes? Have you had any bad experiences with them? Thanks for your input!

They are darkest in the inside corners of my eyes, they are a shade of purple, going out, they get lighter. There are also a couple (small) veins showing.      I've tried covering them up. The concealer I use for the rest of my face doesn't hide them, and even when I try to, after I put some power on, the area around my eyes looks orange while the rest of my face is fine. I heard that using a yellow shade of concealer works well with circles, but I can't seem to pick out a shade of yellow in the make-up aisle, they all look like normal skin tones to me.      I've even tried to treat them using ice cubes, tea bags, cucumbers, and I even went as far as purchasing Clinque's All About the Eyes (for $30), which was suppose to cover them up as well as treat them, but it didn't work.      As a side note, it's just discoloration, no puffiness.

Personally, after showering, I blowdry my straight hair so that it stays put and doesn't look flat. Then I put my leave-on thing that makes it shiny and holds it in place. I don't wear much make-up; it's loose powder and light blush for me. I put eye-liner only at the bottom because I like standout eyes--not so much that I put eyeshadow. But I curl my eyelashes because I think it looks pretty. Swipe some lipgloss, spray some perfume and I'm good to go.      Sorry, I'm not good at being girly. I don't know about you guys. I'd love to hear them.  Oh, and let me know if I'm doing something wrong. XD

When I used to work as a waitress, I was talking to a customer at the counter about my tattoos and this extremely religious couple started lecturing me about how I was going to hell because I defaced my body and all this other fire and brimstone crap. They told me I needed to repent for my sins and instead of a tip they left those little pamphlets about "accepting Christ" and all that jazz. I was just wondering if anybody here with tattoos has ever had that happen to them or if it was just my luck?

I was reading an article about how a high school in texas sent home a few hundred students over belts.The belts were made with too many holes, belt buckles too big, too light brown, whatever.      It made me think about what dress code items either you or someone you work with or go to school with have been sent home/suspended/fired over?      My work has an issue with Capri pants forsome reason. I have no idea why.We can wear skirts above our knees.Capris show less skin.      Also,there is a debate as to what is a flip flop (not allowed) and a thong sandal (which is allowed). My last job was like that too.Sometimes when managers would walk around the office and do "shoe checks" I just put my toes over the straps so no one would see the thong piece.Even though they were leather I didnt want the arguement.

But is someone that is beautiful to you, not beautiful to somebody else?  Or not necessarily that, but not as attractive to someone else?      It seems like, if this is true, that there would be a reason for this...       For example, someone thinks their gf is the "most beautiful girl in the world" however, say, for example, to me I wouldn't find her attractive at all, or not nearly as much, since I have my own definition of what I find beautiful in a girl...      I'm interested to hear both guy's and girl's opinions tho...  Like is attraction that you feel for someone else or finding somebody to be beautiful...  Is it just a matter of personal "taste" (i guess is a good word)?

Hey, i have acne slightly, but it's jus brown marks from previous spots and there are a few bumps here and there.   Therefore as a girl, i want to cover them up using makeup. However too much make up can irrtate the skin and clog pores and make the skin worse and acne worse too.   However i heard that mineral foundation is good for the skin, ok not totally, but it doesnt contain harsh chemicals, but it's light and enables the skin to breathe etc.   So does anyone know any gently make up that is mineralled and is good for the skin and doesnt contian a lot of oily skin, cos my skin gets VERY oily easily!   thanks   xx

It might not be exactly the same, but it'd be nice if I could get your opinions on whether I should wait to get it cut or not.   I think my hair grows a little faster than most people, because I do a lot of things I read make it grow faster.         Anyway, do you think if I got it cut I could get it to look kind of like in the picture? I know it would be a little shorter, but would it still look okay until it grew longer?

I could tell because the earring was a little deeper in my ear than the left one, and when I tried to push it up to clean it, there was almost no gap to clean on the right piercing. It is a little red and swollen, but the only problem is that I have had my ears pierced for 5 weeks now without any infections, so how can it be an infection as of right now? I was thinking maybe the stud in my right ear got pushed in more so it is constricting my right ear, but I don't think that's it. So is it infected? And if it is, how should I treat it? Thanks!
