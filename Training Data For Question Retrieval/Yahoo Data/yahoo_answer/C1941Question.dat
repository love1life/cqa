20090205091607AARNbFO	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Letters of complaint?	I am planning on writing a letter of complaint to a cell phone company who's name I will not mention, but basically I was wanting to know if it is a good idea. I am very disappointed in their warranty service plan. My phone broke just yesterday and I have only had it since Dec and my husband and I bought the warranty service plan but we are still having to pay a detectable because the phone is broken because of me. It fell out of pocket and I didn't realize it until later on and it was in the cold for and 1 hour and a 1/2. So I am responsible for not taking care of my phone however I thought the warranty service would cover my phone breaking, it would almost be cheaper to buy a new phone than my detectable. So I guess my question is should I write a letter of complain or just take responsibility for what happened and pay the detectable.

Please also tell me how to package the Ipod Touch the way I got it.     One more question, I have an app on the Ipod Touch. Its called IMob Online. Its an online game that requires your Itunes account password. Oh and speaking of the Itunes password, could I get that back on my other Ipod Touch? IMob requires a user name and password. If I do switch my Ipod, will I be able to get that same account back and use it on the new Ipod.     I really need to know this stuff, please don't just put a random answer because your answer might just cost me a lot of money.  Thank you.

I've never encountered any frame rate, or "choppy graphics" issues with my 360, but Skate 2 usually starts to get choppy after playing it for a while. I thought it was a heat issue (but having never experienced this before, I was a bit hesitant) - but I've moved the 360 to increase the air flow and nothing has corrected itself. Is it an issue with heat, or have others noticed this "choppy graphics" or slowed frame rate issue when playing this title?

I have a Salt Lake City, Utah real estate investment business and have a pretty large client base. I've also done a lot of advertising with my cell number that I've had for 5 years now. I just moved to Phoenix, Arizona to start up a similar business there. People in AZ don't want to work with someone with a Utah phone number.   What I need is some place to port my Cell number in Verizon wireless that is cheap or free. so that I can get a Phoenix number on my phone. That way both people from Utah and Arizona can reach me on a local number, but when I call, my cell will show my Phoenix number. Any suggestions?

I have Shaw cable and a Motorola HD cable box (non-DVR) and over the last 2 months or so a problem has developed. Sometimes, say 50% of the time, when I switch from an HD channel to a regular channel the picture is completely screwed up. It's all pinky/purple and the left and right halves of the picture swap sides. If I turn the digital box off then on, the problem persists, but if I turn the TV off then on, the picture is good again. It used to be just fine, back and forth, for about a year but now....not so much. Does anyone know what the problem might be and what I could do to fix it? VERY annoying!

My mother passed away and she had a prepaid cell phone that has a lot of minutes left on it and they won't let me close the account until I use up the minutes. I'm wondering if there is some way to call a number that wouldn't reach anyone but that will use up the minutes fast, like some kind of automated international number or something? I don't want to call family or friends because then it uses up their minutes.
