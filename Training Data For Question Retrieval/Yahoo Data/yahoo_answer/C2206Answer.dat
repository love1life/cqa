3Iyu7hrcaa	Depends on the table... depends on the casino...|`|pAqfWJ8Haa	with the exception of keno, the worst bet in the casino is at the craps table with over a 16% house advantage ..i think it is the any seven....if you want to make that bet i'm sure you could get the table maximum raised to about a hundred thousand dollars..............win or lose you probably get a suite.......
z48D2oLoaa	It's illegal to do that, but does it matter if it says Steam install.|`|AWSAnX3iaa	Steam is a game engine, you need it to play games like L4d counter strike, TF2,etc, once you do install steam counter strike u have to pay for, i saw it last time at 10 dollars,but to get a game free is probably a virus and people will probably report you,resulting in a fine.

0JcwHT8Vaa	I had the same problem. What worked for me was keeping my eyes closed when going up the first hill. It seems like it takes forever to get up the hill and for me personally that was the worst part plus your also pretty high up. So I suggest keeping your eyes closed. Once you get past the hill the rest of the ride flashes by. Then it becomes addicting lol. A word advice though: make sure anything in your pockets are nice and secure. The ride jerks you around a lot and I almost lost my cell phone because it bounced out of my pocket. Hope I helped.|`|NA3HDsNnaa	close your eyes & dont think about it|`|Y1Af49sDaa	lol, dont blame ya.

8HunHw3Uaa	Give No Limits a try!<br>  <br>  its really advanced though.|`|GDKBqwwJaa	I dont know of any software you can buy that is specifically for designing coasters, but there are a few games. Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 is my favorite. It is older, but I think it is the most realistic. Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 you can actually ride your coaster from a point of view once you build it, but I find the game less realistic then 2. There's also a game called Thrillville, but that one is more "kiddy" than roller coaster tycoon. Then there is a few on the link below. I had Roller Coaster Factory about 6 years ago and it is very basic. Check out some of the others tho, they are new to me.|`|JvLKLxyFaa	Roller Coater Tycon 1,2,3,4

mn2aMSjZaa	7.5 is the spread. the favored team is expected to win by that margin or more. If you bet on a favored team and the spread is 7.5 and they win by 8 points you win-if they only win by 7 points you lose because they did not cover the spread. The .5 is so there are no ties you either win or lose.

lin0jVvXaa	From start to scratch the average is about 10 months.<br>  This is from designing the ride, to acually constructing the ride. Theres ofcourse forms and things that need to be passed and they can take up to a month or two. Flat rides such as maXair at Cedar Point arent usually designed specifically for the park (like alot of coasters are). These rides are usually picked out from a range of rides. Eg. Frisbees, Drop Towers, Pirate ships etc. They come in pieces and only have to be put up by cranes. This can take anywhere from a week to a month. Carnival rides can be put up in a day or two. This doesnt mean that they arent safe. It means the rides have been specially designed to be portable and able to setup/teardown quick so they can move from show to show. Eg. The Zipper just folds up and the cars just have to be attached. This wouldnt need anymore than 5-6 hours to do including tests. <br>  <br>  But yeah. If you hear a press release for a ride, for example when SFMM announced Terminator, the ride would have been deisgned several months before and is just about ready to begin construction. This coaster is being constructed right now. And from the time the first piece of wood arrived on site, till finished product.. It shouldnt be more than 3 months of acual construction.|`|2n6HSiF0aa	it all depends on the size of the ride and what season it is.<br>  small rides usually take 4-5 months. big roller coasters take about 1 year. rides usually go up during the offseason(when the park is closed).|`|GDKBqwwJaa	It usually takes around 1 year. Some rides can be built quicker, but probably at least 6 months. Parks usually start building rides in late summer and they open up in mid spring.|`|YVfz3KxBaa	Depends how big the ride is<br>  Most parks put rides in in the off season<br>  (when park is closed)<br>  so most go up in 4 months(few months of prebuild from manufacturer)<br>  <br>  <br>  Harry potter land is supposed to take 2 years(universal IOA )<br>  Pilgrims Pride at holiday world is going up in 4 or 5 months.<br>  most parks announce in fall the new rides for next spring.<br>  Some park rides (flats mostly) are prebuilt and just need<br>  power and tied down.|`|cCAGstnpaa	It depends on wht kind of ride you have in mind. Roller coasters take at least a year, because they do it in off season, but here in California our amusement parks are open year-round. For flat rides it usually takes up to 6 months at the most.
KAuPPyxDaa	Add allure of darkness since you have dark armed dragon in. Might as well add in destiny hero malicious since your making kind of like dark synchro deck. Add in goyo guardian, the prices dropped alot for them.
KAuPPyxDaa	Pulling the rug is a card that negates monster with priority effects. You cannot use Pulling the Rug on it. You can use cards like Divine Wrath or monsters like Dark Ruler of Ha Des, Revived King Ha Des, any monster that negates monster effect when destroy as the result of the battle. Solemn Judgment is another good card.|`|QY2Bqvifaa	no, he can't negate pulling the rug's effect since it springs and activates as soon as it's summoned and before Cyber Phoneix's effect can activate.

I have a scrapbook, and it's really funny, because on the first few pages I was all like "WOOO A SCRAPBOOK :D" but now, towards the middlish, it's more like "Okay, now I have to figure out how these pictures can fit on one page and then I can get it over with".<br>  Point is: Add little cute designs or paper cutouts of stuff, it'll really help with it not just looking like a bunch of pages with pictures on them.
127766aa9c415a074e2f444c6c56e4b4aa	No one can help you for it is impossible to grade a coin from a photo. It needs to be seen so that one can twist and turn it to look for hairlines and imperfections. I also must admit, I at least in the last 20 years have not seen a double eagle in a cardboard holder. The mylar makes it even harder to grade also. If you own the coin it would be best to either submit it or see a couple of coin dealers that have a good inventory of gold coins. That does not mean they can grade but you will have sample to compare. Best I can do
95c065274173702e7fa3abcdf4f5d394aa	I agree with Taiping. If the date on the coin holder is 1644 it means it is a coin from the Ming dynasty era. Coins from this time frame are fairly common, it would have to be an unusual size or truly exceptional condition for it to be worth more than a few dollars. Chinese cash coins of the common size, (about the size of a quarter or a little smaller), are commonly available cheaply all the way back to Wu Zhu coinage 100 bc. There are many rarities, and if you wish to look up your specific coin I would suggest "Chinese Cast Coinage" by Hartill. If your library does not have it, they can borrow from another source. It will list relative rarity.|`|127766aa9c415a074e2f444c6c56e4b4aa	Since Chinese coins are not dated from that time how does she know the date? If it is a round coin with a square hole and has 4 Chinese characters on one side then it is a cash coin and one needs to know which one. Most are common and sell from .50 to a couple of dollars and there are a few rare ones. No one can really help with out seeing the coin.

KAuPPyxDaa	If you want to make a light deck, a lightsworn deck would be the best. Go on yahoo answers or google and search for "lightsworn deck" and find one that has a deck list of lightsworn. I suggest you add in Honest, you can activate its effect during anybody's damage step.|`|2Vka5CJlaa	this is just coming from me because i like traps have a play set of trapholes bottomless trapholes and at least 2 acid trapholes<br>  then have another 10-11 traps have about 5-6 spell cards that are Jinzo killers also don't have a lot of situational trap or spell cards they ARE bad!<br>  have the rest be monsters. also have the traps slow down your opponent have a lot of cards like torrential tribute basically to nuke the field when you need it! have 2-3 of your spell cards be cards that help your monster like rush recklessly or black pendent also don't run alot of monsters that have abilities have maybe 4-5 of your monsters have abilities that way you can run a skill drain! they basically say NO to Dark Armed Dragon and Gladiator Beasts along with Light Sworn decks then run some BIG normal monsters that way you have the strength to blow away your opponents monsters but also have 1-2 monsters with HIGH defense that don't require a sacrifice because that can stall them until you get you big monsters out.

You imprint Blaze or Fireball onto Panoptic Mirror for how many ever mana you want to use and then at the beginning of EVERY one of your upkeeps (until they kill the Mirror) it's like you have a copy of Blaze or Fireball ready to go in your hand with that amount of power that you imprinted for THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY TO DROP. Think about it... My boyfriend unleashed that combo on me awhile back and I thought I was going to wet myself. He was loosing the game BAD and he turned around and beat the three of us in 4 or 5 rounds. It was sick. :D|`|uRqm4Bxcaa	I like it.  You could also side in Lightning Helix for additional creature elim and since some of these cards can be rendered useless by opponent sideboard.  This is an interesting deck though...  Get it down to 60 cards as well.

pjdb70Zaaa	3/10<br>  <br>  Glads + LS = DISASTER<br>  <br>  Its a horrible idea (no offense) but yea. He could mix Lightsworn with Zombies or maybe DAD but definitely not Glads. They just don't synergize. Although Darius relies on the graveyard for his effect to be used properly foolish burial or a destroyed glad beast takes care of that. Tell him to discontinue the deck immediately.<br>  <br>  Have him decide if he wants Lightsworn or GB's and then tell me. I can help then.<br>  <br>  Btw some of the cards in the monster line up are wrong.<br>  Normally players run 1 Jain if any at all.<br>  No one runs Aurkus. At least form decks I've seen.<br>  <br>  Dimicari and Andal are useless and normally one equeste is needed in the main body. If your friend belives in running 2 tell him to side one.<br>  <br>  Sorry to seem harsh and cruel but yea lol.|`|QY2Bqvifaa	7/10. Your friend should choose 1 set, either Gladiator Beast or Lightsworn cause those two don't mix well. Use the Waboku cards since they save your monster cards from being destroyed, use 1 Shrink and 1Enemy Controller. Add a Scarp-Iron Scarecrow and if he can get the Gragonith, The Lightsworn Dragon, Morphing Jar and Judgement Dragon, he might be able to make a few spectacular wins

A very good example of Role-playing games [RPG] are Fallout 3, Fable 2, Lost Oddysey, and Mass Effect. For shooters and action packed fun, I would Recommend Both Gears of War 1 and 2, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare [excellent], Rainbow 6 Vegas 1 and 2, Mirrors Edge [very innovative]. I am not adept at naming good sports games, but I do know the obvious are ones like Madden. Xbox 360 makes pretty good games, but it just all depends on your preference in games, and just take a look at some of them to see if they are right for you. If all else fails, it never hurts to rent a game!

DsWgAqS8aa	Once you arrive in Balance Valley, enter the one house in the area to learn that it is up to you to save Lin. Return to Palm Brinks and get Dr. Dell to join your party. He resides in the house next to the Palm Brinks Lake. Go back to Lin’s house with Dr. Dell to find out that you need to rebuild Balance Valley to help save Lin. Enter the Starlight Canyon dungeon and collect the Geostone on each floor. When you reach Yorda’s Valley, return to Balance Valley and begin rebuilding the Georama according to the checkpoints. The Balance Valley Georama is slightly different than Sindain. The reason it is called Balance Valley, is because you have to balance the four pillars in the valley evenly with the georama objects. In other words: try to place one house on each of the four pillars to keep the pillars at an even level. The chart in the lower right side of the screen tells you which pillar is lower, etc. Refer to Balance Valley Georama page for more detailed information. Rebuild the town to at least 60% complete and travel to the future via the Red Time Gate to visit Starlight Temple. Enter the heart-shaped doors to Lao Chao’s Bistro, and Chao will express interest in helping the duo, but needs a White Wind Flower in order to make the medicine to cure Lin. Head back to the present via the Blue Time Gate and enter the dungeon floor named Barga’s Valley. Here you will learn a new game called Spheda. Find the Handy Stick by the water and talk to Monica to get the Spheda lesson. Refer to the Spheda tips for further information. You will need to complete this tutorial to receive the White Wind Flower from Barga. Take the White Wind Flower to Lao Chao in the future to make Miracle Dumplings that you need to take back to Lin via the Blue Time Gate. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps.
aoyiPTmGaa	I think you should get it. Theres PLENTY hours of gameplay. As for nearly every game, there is maybe a level or too that may make you say "aww i hate this place" but that doesnt mean its not enjoyable or fun, its interesting and may get a little scary from time to time. The levels and things you must do in the game are important in the game. <br>  <br>  There is no "you gotta do this for no reason." Especially with some of the puzzles, there was a few that had me tryna figure it out for half an hour until i watched a walkthrough on youtube. As you play it only gets better with time. Plus its 5 games for the price of 1. Be a gamer and buy it!! its worth the money.|`|MDf0BoiNaa	yeah people are definintely still playing it. a friend of mine is always playing it.|`|227b14cb2ec949a2ecdd4ba7068ff421aa	Yes if you like it get it. I'm not sure who told you that but it's a great game. Oh yeah but if you want to play online you probably won't find alot of people.|`|FPsMtmThaa	Do not question. Just got get it.  It's a great deal and yes people are still playing Team Fortress 2. I was on it yesterday and got a match pretty quickly.  It's not as populated as it used to be but once Valve releases some more DLC, which will probably be sooner rather than later, you'll see people coming back to it.  Plus you get 4 other incredible games.  Looks for a used version and it will be the best investment you've ever made.<br>  <br>  Portal won game of the year.  Enough said.|`|8rwa9zJbaa	I play OB online every day so I'm not sure what people are talking about when they say there aren't a lot of people on there..<br>  <br>  The only lack of play would be if you were trying to play Hydro as no good server ever seems to host it.  But if you're a dustbowl, well, granary, or 2fort fan like me, then you'll have no problems finding a game.<br>  <br>  And as some one already mentioned, once the DLC that valvE has promised, the online 360 community will explode again.<br>  <br>  Basically TF2 is the greatest thing that has ever happened to the 360 and I feel bad for anyone who hasn't played it.<br>  <br>  Having said that, there are some issues a pc user will find disappointing...<br>  <br>  there are no voice commands mapped to any buttons (or able to be mapped..), there is no button for "last disguise" for the spy, and you can't spray paint.|`|lOuz0nU2aa	You should get it for the Xbox 360 if you are just going to play the story mode. The game is very old and no one plays online anymore. So once you beat the story mode, you'll probably never play the game again.

Some gym leaders have new pokemon, you can catch Dialga, Palkia, and Girantina all in one game.

0qN0eUbUaa	uggghhhh brain hurts....<br>  Anyway the only real problem isn't with your theory, but with the sports themselves. Any given game has a variety of possible outcomes.Unforeseeable factors such as injuries during the game will affect the overall scheme of things. Lets say a starting wide receiver takes a big hit and is taken out during the 1st quarter. The spread hasn't accounted for it and in most private(and illegal) groups the spread will likely remain the same. Good work on the math though the principles sound, its just that its really unpredictable.|`|85AoQYh8aa	I would say very tourgh, but possible and the more you do it the more likely you end up down money.  <br>  <br>  Just think about it you are really betting against the people who are making the odds whos whole career is to get your bet to as close as 50/50 as possible and so on the bet the house will roughly break even, on occassion lose big or win big but overall the bets come down to around 50/50, but the house has a vig on every bet which is gonna make them the winner and the gambler the loser over time.  Now the only way you can beat the house is if you believe you know more than the people making the odds which face it, it's there life to know this stuff so I would say most people dont have much of a chance.|`|b952dc4daef7cdac170e8b48c85a490daa	It is not probable to stay ahead with betting, even with that random stuff like injuries you are still at 50% odds of winning and any juice charged onto this only hurts your winnings.  Parlays are even WORSE when it comes to odds. Your best bet would be to bet though someone who wont charge juice, like a friend/family, but even then you are still at a 50/50 chance of making money in the long run.|`|tBsMH9kGaa	Yeah with your friends or family members|`|AA11868171	You can bet for free @ <a href="http://www.bettorfan.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bettorfan.com</a> They give you money to bet with so it is risk-free.
127766aa9c415a074e2f444c6c56e4b4aa	The cent is not old enough to have any collector value unless in a high mint state grade. The 1903 Liberty Head or Barber dime has a value of $2.50 in grade good up to $17 in grade extra fine & more if it grades higher. Your coin may have a mint mark, if it has one it is on the wreath side at the bottom under the bow. The 1903-O is worth a little more and the 1903-S starts at $60 in grade good and goes up from there.

AA10247494	Hmm I use Wonder and Somnophore in my blue white deck but I'm running soldiers. Perhaps your could find some cards that boost warriors or consider making your deck a theme (like elves or soldier, ect) to give your deck more synergy. Every card you drop should boost another and if it doesn't help the deck in whole get rid of it. <br>  <br>  Your spells look good but think about adding a Holy Day and a Piety Charm might help you out.

If it's a card where extra copies would be useless you could run 2 or 3 instead. You want to run more copies of your best cards so you have the highest chance to be able to use them

Noobs will often insult others, calling them newbs for not listening to their (often bad) advice, and will get greatly upset if anyone tries to critique their play or give them advice.<br>  <br>  Over time, the differences between the two phrases have kind of faded into the background, and the term "noob" is generally used to refer to either.|`|YSrDeg5Xaa	noob aka n00b = newbie|`|rtRBtFGbaa	a noob is a a new person that is not used to the video game|`|SFW3hSrQaa	if you are unskilled, or not good enough = noob|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	someone who is new or unskilled at a game.  often it gets thrown out there by players who dont seem to realize we were ALL noobs at one point or another, and is most frequently abused by people who THINK they are good at a game, but actually suck

At the moment there is no golden method to earning money online but rather separate smaller ways to make your money.<br>  <br>  Six of the most common;<br>  1. Blogging and running adverts or affiliate products alongside<br>  2. Write articles for associated articles.<br>  3. Selling photos to istock or fotolia<br>  4. Fill out online surveys for money<br>  5. Make money on Secondlife or other online games (poker e.t.c)<br>  6. Freelancing, writing, graphic design and programming<br>  <br>  Again you will probably need to do ALL of these to really start earning money and of course some pay quicker than others. All will take hard work though and as the old adage goes you only earn what you are worth!<br>  <br>  Thr site below has more in depth info on how to earn from the above methods and all of them are free to do.

59AZ4GKVaa	Hello fellow Pokemon trainer, here I am to resolve your question & hopefully get my points in return. Guess what? I have the code you are looking for. Are you ready, you sure, well, are you? Well then, here's the code already:<br>   <br>  -ALL Shiny Pokemon-<br>  <br>  12068AC6<br>  000046C0<br>  <br>  Ok, you're welcome!! Anyways, this code turns all your Pokemon into shiny, the 6 Pokemon that are with you, the Pokemon that are in the PC, even the wild ones too. If you want to keep a few of them from not turning shiny, then you should trade from versions. Well, hope this helps you in your quest. Good luck & good bye !!

T5DbLLgQaa	Well, basics are easy to learn but then again the recorder is NOT a "children only" instrument if you decide to take it seriously!! Yamaha recorders are all good enough indeed, but if you decide to play it a bit longer I suggest you to change over to a wooden model instead of plastic to ensure much better sound quality. In addition, recorder players usually play also other than just soprano recorder, there are lots of sizes and recorder types there (mainly for professionals) but I suggest you to try to buy at least the soprano and the alto recorders for yourself. I have 5 sizes of recorders already (sopranino, soprano, alto, tenor, bass), all of Yamaha brand, and they are all very reliable instruments indeed. Needless to say, I love my hobby of playing the recorders but I also highly respect virtuoso recorder players such as Dan Laurin, Michala Petri and Pamela Thorby who help make the recorder more than just a "school instrument"!|`|NA3HDsNnaa	not hard to learn i could play one perfectly in 4th grade! lol!

TTn6KDp5aa	An excerpt from serebii.net:<br>  <br>  Mirage Island, you probably have heard of it. This Island, situated on Route 130 in Ruby & Sapphire contains one of the mysteries which has confused many and still eludes thousands of trainers worldwide.<br>  <br>  Now this island can only be seen one way, and it's complicated. Each day, Mirage Island gets assigned a random number. Now Mirage Island only appears when a Pokémon on your team has the same number as Mirage Island's number. Now the number changes every day and it must match the Island's. It also has to be a Pokémon on your team. This makes your chances of seeing Mirage Island very rare.<br>  <br>  What you should do, instead of surfing there every single day is do the following;<br>  <br>  # Go to Pacifidlog Town<br>  # Go to the Bottom Right House<br>  # Talk to the Old Man there<br>  <br>  If he says he cannot see Mirage Island, then none of your party's Numbers match that of Mirage Island's...so you'll have to keep trying. If he says he can see it, then leave and surf to it.<br>  <br>  <br>  There isn't much to do there, though; all it is is a berry patch(with a berry you can't get anywhere else: the liechi berry) and some tall grass(with only one pokemon: a wynaut). So all in all, it isn't really worth your time.|`|FH2rD2aUaa	go to passive log town or whatever its called and talk to the old guy in the house looking out the window, he will say i see the island today or something like that if u have a pokemon with u at the desired lvl now there is no way of knowing what lvl pkm to bring i got there with a lvl 54 gardivor the first time the a 36 milotic the second time i new gamed<br>  <br>  what im trying to say is that its totally random oh the pokemon has to be first|`|tgzGcu5uaa	Mirage island sould be located east of Pacifilog Town. I've been there once and found alot of Wynauts- so you should wander around and try and find the island with a Wynaut or Wobbafet (?) in the front of your party. I've also heard its random to find it.<br>  <br>  To 'locate it' you'll have to find it once and count the steps back. I'm pretty sure its VERY far east of Pacifilog, though.|`|bZcHoo8caa	Mirage Island is located east of Slateport, past Pacifilog Town. There is an old man in the southeaster most house, and he will tell you when he can see Mirage Island. It only appears like twice a year or something like that, so you should probably check every day.

No le pongas mucho chile, porque eso puede ocasionarte sensación de nauseas a la hora de hacer ejercicio. De preferencia no comas justo antes de irte a los aeróbicos. Hazlo por lo menos media hora antes. Toma agua sin azúcar, y de preferencia sin saborizantes, porque eso también puede provocar naúseas.<br>  También puedes probar, si eso te cae muy pesado, comer unas siete nueces o siete almendras antes de hacer tu clase. Las nueces y las almendras te proporcionan energía y no creo que te provoquen náuseas.<br>  Saludos y me dices si te funciona!

2a57e0f09857ea9f8fd6a81caf945966aa	Amigo:<br>  <br>  Si lo que quieres ver son ovnis, te recomiendo que mejor uses unos buenos binoculares.  Los telescopios tiene mayor alcance, pero son mas dificiles de ajustar y enfocar, mientras que los binoculares son mas sencillos de operar y puedes seguir "algo" con mayor facilidad.<br>  <br>  Aqui en mexico hay un lugar que se llama sanborns, donde puedes encontrar muchos modelos y para todos los bolsillos.<br>  <br>  En lo personal te recomiendo que ya sea binoculares o telescopio que adquieras, asegurate de que sea hecho en Alemania, y que los lentes tambien sean alemanes.<br>  <br>  Ultimamente hay una invasion de productos chinos de muy mala calidad.<br>  <br>  Saludos|`|SDHvDNGJaa	En todos los centros comerciales existen tiendas especializadas de regalos, allí encuentras telescopios en México.|`|259163bb3edc7e1906281f1edda52e27aa	jaime maussan vende.<br>  <br>  SALUDOS !!!|`|67v30YVqaa	Las cámaras igual sirven pero debes salir a la ISS en el próximo vuelo.<br>  Lo otro sería adquirir un telescopio en otra galaxia, ya que desde ésta no podrás verlos, un telescopio sirve para ver cosas lejanas y que no cambien de lugar tan rápido como se dice que lo hacen los OVNIS.<br>  Te recomiendo un prismático de 30-50X con zoom.|`|7832875efc5f6bec44a0240d97a7c26eaa	ud tiene razon , opino que nunca habra , ya que es algo que esta hecho para verse de lejos y borroso, asi como el yeti y otras cosas raras del planeta en que vivimos.
