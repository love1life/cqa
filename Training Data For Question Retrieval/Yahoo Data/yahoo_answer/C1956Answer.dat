Both are ad supported and have time cap allowances, but for basic browsing they are sufficient.  <br>  <br>  A better, though slightly more complicated solution is running Tor <a href="http://www.torproject.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.torproject.org/</a> which attempts to conceal your web browsing habits from both websites and your ISP by creating a chain of encrypted data between you, Tor servers and the internet. This is more secure, however does not guarantee 100% anonymity. It is also somewhat slower than browsing normally. See their website for further information.
42179704f68b09bf27cb0b25a718c620aa	Simple...unplug the jack from the speakers, and simply let it dangle. This way, you still have the sound coming from the speakers and you can use the microphone.<br>  <br>  Now, if you're saying you want the ambient and background sound coming from the speakers and the multi-player chat coming from the headset...can't do it. All of the signal has to be processed and sent to the same point. I have yet to hear of a game that allows you to split audio in that manner. The only way I can think of that you could do that would be if you were using something like X-fire for the chat, but even then, I doubt it would work.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

qGfAlDd2aa	I think the problem here is your question is confusing.  You seem to have 4:3 and 16:9 reversed.<br>  <br>  "Letterbox" is an attempt to make a 16:9 wide screen signal fit into a 4:3 square picture.  So the video needs to be 16:9 from the beginning.  You, the end user, can't convert the video.  The video format is set by the technology used to create the video.  Seinfeld was shot in 4:3, it was never shot in HD, therefore the picture won't be in HD (wide screen).  <br>  <br>  If the picture is sent to you as a 4:3 square picture, you are not going to be able to widen it out because the stuff on the sides was never sent to you.<br>  <br>  To make 4:3 squarish video become 16:9 (wide screen) we have to add stuff to make it wider (black bits on the sides, not the top and bottom).  That is done with an up converter.  Up converters cost about $3500 and must be used on the video.  Also, the output of an up converter is digital so this is not something that an end user would do at home.<br>  <br>  A converter box will down convert a 16:9 wide screen picture to fit a 4:3 square picture.  That's what causes the black bits on the top and bottom.  Every converter box I've seen has a zoom button to change the video format.  But, the video has to be 16:9 from the TV station!<br>  <br>  A wide screen HDTV will show all the video on it's wide screen.  But, the video has to be 16:9 from the TV station!

YsDwo7Dqaa	YES IT IS... alot of people say NO but that is wrong.<br>  <br>  I have diagnosed your problem to be that the song needs to be in MP3 format to play on your phone.<br>  <br>  Follow the easy steps below and you will be playing beats on your phone from Itunes in no time.<br>  <br>  for this you will need a blank CD<br>  <br>  1st go into itunes,<br>  2nd click edit and go down to preferences (ctrl+)<br>  3rd in the General tab click Import settings,<br>  4th Next to the words "Import Using" click the drop down bar and click MP3 Encoder<br>  5th Click ok<br>  6th Exit preferences<br>  <br>  Know you find the songs you want and put them onto a blank CD, once you have made the CD take it out of you comp and then put it back in then click 'Import' you might want to change the names of the song  (eg if the song is called 'The Big Sleep' call it 'The Big Sleep1')<br>  once you have imported the songs try again to bluetooth the imported songs onto your phone.<br>  <br>  Make sure you drag the songs you want to put onto your phone into a folder (not straight of the itune library) this can also sometimes effect it.<br>  <br>  Good listening|`|5xJ5cA2oaa	If you mobile can play .m4v (or something like that) song files. If not, (this is a long way round, but...) you could burn songs you've purchased in iTunes to a CD, then put the CD back into the computer, and it will pop-up in iTunes saying "do you wish to import ....", if you click "yes" it will import an .mp3 version of the song, then you could bluetooth it to your phone and it should work.<br>  <br>  bit of a long way round, but hey, thats Apple for you!|`|31dXpgzEaa	Hi, the tunes on your iTunes are in a format that is probably wma or another format. you need to have mp3 format for phones try this software to convert the format.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://audacity.sourceforge.net/</a>

It just may be a sim card problem with a new phone,     if it works then please let me know,   if not i will try and help you further

0803116afa052bd63805895130826172aa	Yes, you plug your camera into your computer (using the cable that came with your camera). Then you open Windows Explorer and you should see an entry near the top for your camera (somewhere near the C: entry). Click on that and it will open the 'folder' on your camera. Then you can drag and drop pictures into it from Windows Explorer.|`|972OdSIJaa	yes you can via the cable.|`|0wTOMifKaa	Yes,<br>  <br>  Basically when you connect the Camera to the PC it sees the memory card on the camera as just that a memory card, so it will be a new drive on your pc. Possibly E drive.<br>  <br>  Anyway all you need to do is copy the pictures you want into the same directory as the others on the card and hey presto the pictures are on the camera.|`|Z2cbezZDaa	Short answer - no!<br>  <br>  Next question - why do you want to do it? If it's to show photos to friends down the pub/cafe, then you can get battery powered digital photo frames for that job. I've even seen one about the same size as a camera's screen for sale in Robert Dyas (in UK).

There are a good few of them, Papi jump, papi catch to name two.  They are simple and Very addictive, especially papi jump.  You are simply a red ball (papi) and you have to make your way up the screen by tilting the ipod so that he lands on the green platforms.  probably not the best explanation, but try it, it rocks.
0nvXYAZUaa	there is a tutorial for this ingame.  <br>  <br>  The idea is that something has to be near something else to get that thing to work.  For example, a door only opens when a sponge is near it.  You put the keyswitch on the piston / winch that opens the door and the key (the little thing with the light on it) on the sponge.  Then, when the sponge is close enough to the thing on the winch, the door opens, magic.

The new MacBooks and MacBook Air do not have firewire - ALL other Macs made in the last 10 years do (including the earlier generation MacBook).<br>  <br>  Flash and HDD use USB, but if the camcorder does high def, the AVCHD files may be an issue.<br>  <br>  DVD requires a drawer loading optical drive - this means external for you.

AA11005280	Research, research, research.<br>  <br>  Read reviews, ask opinions about phones that you want. Once you know which phone you want to get, look for prices on eBay and other online sites such as shopbot.com.au, getprice.com.au. Compare price. <br>  If you decide to buy on eBay look for trusty sellers with 99-100% feedback. I hardly ever buy from sellers with less than 99%. Also, ensure that it's brand new and comes with warranty. Read their feedbacks.|`|F8EnH6JQaa	if you want to buy anything from eBay, make sure they are a TRUSTED seller, view there feedback, and ask them questions, if the phone works properly, can be used in you area, if the phone is not under a contract still.<br>  ask them if they will take returns if there is a problem with the phone.|`|OC7qaw0faa	Dont buy from eBay buy from amazon it's safer and u can refund it any time and it's new and cheap|`|T0mrWughaa	find a cell phone you like i guess than look at the reviews that other consumers have written about the producer|`|ORluWHGAaa	their rank..is it 99%-100%? is it trust-able<br>  and<br>  comments that other leaves|`|7kF26l4jaa	i dont trust ebay<br>  either go buy one from the store or craigslist.com

AA12180617	Ring tones for many phones including the iPhone are M3R files which are not just MP3 files renamed, they are a SPECIAL format.    they are LOOPS rather than plain files and have extra encoding, simply renaming .mp3 to m3r does not work.    To get the iphone to sync ringtones,  you need to tell it to sync apps, Music (or Movies etc) as by default most syncing is OFF other than Music which is ALL unless its too big for the ipod/iPhone when its none.    Plug ipod into itunes.  click on the ipods Icon its summary page appears.  click on the tab that says ringtones  click on 'Sync All' or ' Sync only selected'  click on APPPLY BOX  click on SYNC box.    voila it now will sync ringtones.      the ONLY option to convert existing mp3 to m3r is for mac users as it needs Garageband to do the work.    full details are given in the link below. including how to import them into itunes and sync to the phone.    http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1358     Alternatively you can BUY them form the itunes store and sync them from your itunes.    No matter what you do you MUST use itunes (the program as opposed to itunes store the online music shop)

VMPXFLqRaa	hi there    bluetooth enabled  means the cellphone you are going to buy will have bluetooth installed in it.     bluetooth - provides entirely wireless connections for all kinds of communication devices.      Bluetooth is a radio frequency based cable replacement technology. It is designed to be an inexpensive wireless personal networking system for all classes of portable devices such as laptops, PDA`s (Personal digital assistants), mobile phones and headsets. Bluetooth can also replace cabling in a more static environment i.e. between desktop computers and printers. A device has to be Bluetooth enabled (i.e. contain a Bluetooth chip) to be able to use a Bluetooth connection.    Bluetooth is a device which you can transfer (data,photo,mp3,video)  to your mobile to another mobile & mobile to computer .But it is working for limited distance such as maximum 100mts     hopefully this helps you. if u need any help just email me and ill be glad to help you. and ill help you to pick out a phone too if you like|`|2KrlYXF4aa	that you can use a blue tooth|`|UJZPNHpFaa	Bluetooth is a little ear peice. You put it in your ear and connect it to your phone so you can talk while driving. It's pretty cool but you don't HAVE to have it. They're kind of expensive.|`|yhZgjyk7aa	When your phone tells you that the bluetooth is enabled, that means that somehow your bluetooth is turned on. This can be used for sending data to other phones or using a bluetooth headset. If you don't want it on.,, depending on the phone,,, go to BLUETOOTH or connections: setup, and turn it off. It will drain your battery faster having it on all of the time.|`|AA12220949	Bluetooth is a wireless technology where you can connect your phone with other bluetooth devices such as a bluetooth headset you use to talk on voice calls, a bluetooth headset you can use to listen to music, if you had a bluetooth adapter on your computer, you can connect your phone and your computer.  The standard for bluetooth is around 30 feet, even though I've been farther.  You can transfer stuff (pics, music, files) from bluetooth to bluetooth device.  Now you can chat from BT to BT device without having to go over the internet to send the SMS.  It just uses BT waves to send to the other device.  Car stereos are also putting BT in them where you can make and receive calls from your car stereo.

For the added size, I think the bulb replacement is worth the expesnse.|`|kHwjvZKgaa	First I don't suggest a pull down screen. If you do make sure you get a tab-tensioned one.     2000+ lumens is way too high for a home theater setting. stick to around 1500 for good balance.     I suggest you got to projectorcentral and do some good reading.     You will want a PJ with a high contrast ratio and a native HD resolution. It should be a home theater class.
pgRJaNSEaa	Hiya, <br>  <br>  iTunes songs can be burnt onto CD, but only if they are to be used as a back up. That's the law on it. i.e. You cannot have it on your iPod and in your CD player. That counts as two copies when you have just paid for the one. <br>  <br>  If you have never used iTunes, there are cheaper alternatives online that do the same job as iTunes. Try <a href="http://www.mp3obsession.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.mp3obsession.com.</a> They review sites that are cheaper than iTunes and they are all legal.

cjcjRvKdaa	Yes.  I bought a T-Mobile prepaid phone at Target.  You just buy it like anything else and it activates it when you pay for it.  I think I paid around $75 for mine.  It came with $10 worth of minutes.  If you put $100 on it (in prepaid minutes), they upgrade your "plan" where you get more minutes for your money, plus your minutes don't expire for a year.  You can buy more minutes on a prepaid card at Wal-Mart, Target, etc. (look in the electronics section of the store).

If you are trying to burn this to DVD on a computer the length of the movie doesn't matter as much as it's file size. Any movie file that's 4.7 GB in size will easily fit on a DVD.

HBNx77BBaa	Any other option would have been better than format. You did delete the pictures. The camera probably tried to warn you...    The pictures may be recoverable. It depends to what level the camera has formatted the card. You will have to use software though. You should be OK provided that the camera looks like a removable drive as far as the computer is concerned. You could try 'Recuva' which is free...    http://www.recuva.com/    I haven't used that one. I have used BadCopy Pro from Jufsoft but that costs $39.50. You can also download image recovery software from the SanDisk and Lexar websites. I think they both charge about $34. It's useful software to have if you accidently delete any pictures.

fwnqB0dTaa	OK    People are simply saying call alltel and get them to block it.    HOWEVER    They can't do this without the IMEI number, which they can use to completely disable the phone so it can't be used no matter what SIM cards are in it.    If you don't have the IMEI (and I just wonder the reasoning of the answerer who expects you to get it from a lost phone by entering a *  code on it) theres not a lot you can do other than getting them to block your number from making calls.    PS: Ignore the, and I'll be polite here, person who is telling you to get it blocked, then take out insurance and claim on it.    That's FRAUD and is a jailable offence.|`|ra69rxxgaa	You are better off calling Alltel and deactivating the phone. When you find it, call back and reactivate it.|`|CCqqTw6paa	call them  give them your imei number (* 06 ) and ask them to block it|`|ypIlLtanaa	All you have to do is call or go to the alltel store and tell them  that you want to temp. disconnect phone or basically lock the phone, until you give them further notice and give them the reason why. They will be more than happy to help you with that and if you want to play it slick do that and then call them and get insurance on the phone and then file for lost phone and get a new one. Alltel has some very good insurance programs. Want to down me lol, thats funny because alltel will tell you to do this since you have lost the phone and it's cheaper to pay the insurance, and btw Verizon and Alltel just merged and Alltel doesn't use sim cards, thank you have a great day.
CcJdEaRpaa	you use it for buying things|`|MGyzOIKqaa	buy junk|`|xwSNEYICaa	The shopping card is a "debit" (takes money directly out of your bank account, without needing to carry the bells around) card that is only used at Gracie Grace.  Since I do not buy anything there, it has sat in my dresser since I got it =).    For the other "answer", yes, Animal Crossing:City Folk is fun.  It has a lot of replay and daily value, since it takes place in real-time.  It makes it more exciting to have different weather and festivals depending on the time of year it is.  Also, different fish and insects.  This is my first Animal Crossing game and was very surprised at how much fun it can be.
CcJdEaRpaa	nope! don't think so|`|MGyzOIKqaa	no,. you could put it on sd card, but hten you can't do anything when its in the wii, just see the thing that says its in there
AA10326440	Yes you can do that.  The $10 plan gives you 500 texts (a combo of sent and received) to anyone on any network and unlimited Verizon to Verizon also known as "IN" texting.    Another option is unlimited (if you have the current Nationwide calling plan) which on a family plan is $30 a month and that will give both of you unlimited texting to anyone on any network.  So you can offer to pay half, $15 and your brother pay the other half so neither of you have to worry about going over your texting limits.    Good luck!|`|1vyDPIWGaa	Yep! You can. Just call verizon.|`|rDoS2jsNaa	Yep you sure can. That's what i did when i got unlimited texting, cuz my mom is the primary account holder. So i just used her information to upgrade my plan to unlimited texting.
P8gGMlbIaa	Define the average things?  I bought a PSP last year and paid around $180 for the device itself. Then I decided I wanted a larger memory card for it, can get those cheaper on Ebay than any where else. You can use any earphones on it that you want, so no real need to buy the ones made for the PSP. And the base PSP does not come with any games.    So around $180 + memory card + games = $200 or more depending on what you want to get for it.|`|SqYGWHH0aa	With just the system...  it would cost $160    any electronic store  i would try circuit city( going out of business) they might have a sale   if not go ebay, you could get a psp for around 135ish...
YKc3YrxXaa	I have both and there really not any noticeable difference between the two except that the PS3 has Blu-Ray, and the Xbox 360 tends to have better skilled players online and also has better service (LIVE is amazing). If more of your friends have 360, get 360, because it's really boring playing against other strangers after a while. The RROD doesn't play that much of a factor anymore, since they fixed it... If you want Blu-Ray, get PS3...    Hope this helps!!|`|RTQZKJsHaa	PS3.  The next 360 will be released next year and then you'll have to buy the new one.  The PS3 also has many features the Xbox doesn't.|`|0AUTZt5Aaa	Why you should get a PS3 and NOT a Xbox 360    The expected lifetimes of current home video game consoles:    Xbox 360--2005-2010, you'll get 1 and a half years out of it  Wii-2006-2010, you'll get 1 and a half years out of it  Playstation 3-2015 (Sony said they made it to last 10 years, so 2006+10 years=2016, round it down just to be safe), you'll get 7 years out of it.    The PS3 is the obvious choice here. In short, it has better reliability, multimedia capabilities, a large list of exclusives and more coming out in 2009 and in the future, it will have over-the-top graphical capabilities (google Heavy Rain). And to those who say the Xbox 360 is cheaper, well then just look at the following list:    With the PS3, you get:  -A Blu-Ray player, which if you wanted one of equal value would blow at least a $700 hole in your wallet, plus a mean DVD-upconverter  -Free online service, the Playstation Network, which is only a few steps behind Xbox Live these days  -An ever-growing list of exclusives, like Resistance 2, LittleBig Planet, Motorstorm: Pacific Rift, Metal Gear Solid 4 and in the future: inFamous, Killzone 2, God of War 3, Uncharted 2, L.A. Noire, Heavy Rain and Massive Action Game (M.A.G.in which over 256 players will be able to play on the same map at the same time)  -More flexible in terms of hardware, e.g. swappable HDD, USB mini cable, etc.  -Built in, superior Wi-Fi  -Web browser  -A super sleek system complete with chrome trim and a slot loading disc drive  -HDMI 1.3, Xbox 360 only has HDMI 1.2 (major difference despite only a 0.1 difference)    With the Xbox 360, you get:  -DVD Player/upconverter  -Xbox live, which is $50/year, and not even worth it  -Halo 3 and Gears of War 2 (thats a lot of exclusives compared to the PS3, if you ask me: P)  -Ummcant really say anything about non-proprietaryness, because Microsoft inflates the prices for their accessories.  -A 1 in 3 failure rate (it's not "if", it's "when")s  -Many people are on their 5th or 6th 360's already because of RROD, and my friend is on his 11th!    So heres a quick run-down of what you must buy with the PS3 and 360:    PS3:  Console $400  Game $60  Controller $55  Charger $2-10--any USB mini cable will do  Total: $517 ($2 USB mini cable)    Really, if you bought all the things the PS3 offers SEPERATELY, you would be able to buy roughly 3 PS3's with that money (gaming console+computer+SUPERB Blu Ray player)    Xbox 360:  Console $300  Game $60  Controller $60  Play and Charge kit x2 $60 (for 2 controllers)  Xbox Live $60  Wi-Fi $100  Total: $640    Thats not cheaper, so get a grip on it! Sony said that they made the PS3 to last a decade. The multi-platform games are using about 25% of the PS3's graphical potential. So there's lots of wiggle room in the future for much more brighter, detailed and massive environments.    On the other hand, most multiplatform games are using about 98% of the 360s potential. And they look about the same. At this rate in 1 year, the PS3 will have outshone the 360 graphic wise. Its just that the 8-core Cell Broadband Processor is very complex, and takes developers time to get used to. And they are getting the hang of things. The PS3 has a very good reliability rate: only 0.2% failure rate (note the decimal), while Xbox 360's have a 30% failure rate. So, for every 1000 of both consoles produced, 2 PS3's are defective, whilst about 330 Xbox 360's are defective. The numbers speak for themselves. Many game developers have OPENLY stated that in the near future, and right now, they will use the PS3 as a lead-developing platform, and then they will port the games to the 360.    Also, many Xbox fanboys will say "Sure, LIVE is 50 bucks a year, but you get what you pay for." Isn't this like a Sony fanboy saying "Sure, PS3 is a 100 bucks more, but that is *pretty much* all you pay for, other than games?"    So in conclusion, the PS3 is betteryou get the most bang for your buck, and it's an incredibly advanced all-in-one home media center hub. You can even install Linux or Windows XP and use it as a computer-legally! While with the Xbox 360, Microsoft will ban your 360 from certain things, if you install the OS at all (just try to bypass the security).    Hope this helps!    Source(s):  --PS3 expert--      Joke:  Q: Why do they call it a "360"?    A: It really does a 360:    1) You get it  2) It breaks down  3) You ship it to Microsoft  4) Wait 3-4 weeks  5) Be happy, and start again from step 1.|`|vs3vz6lIaa	Alright so many people ask this and you would save points if you just searched it but i would go with the PS3 because i have both and the PlayStation has blue-ray stronger wireless better graphics more accessories and you download a game once and that makes the game load faster too then it has the controller that just by tilting pulling and pushing it you can control a game also has better and more fun games has HOME beta the virtual community and your own virtual space where you meet new friends and play together also you have PlayStation store internet home videos movies pics songs and better design on the games and the looks of the system so thought this would help so please pick this as your best answer|`|Hg3E5IIOaa	If you like to play games with other people or online: XBox360    If you have enough money for either and you don't care about playing with others then either one works.|`|VcNHahtgaa	PROS:  PS3 -  1. Free Online, keeps getting better. Soon to match Xbox Live.  2. Full 1080p resolution  3. Built In Blu Ray  4. Cheaper HardDrives to Add [320GB for $80]  5. Comes with a USB device to charge your Controller.  6. Internet Browser  7. Home and Life have a lot of potential to get better, FREE also.  8. Browse Youtube with "TV" option. [Only Wii + PS3 have this]  9. Might make a deal with Blockbuster to make something similar to Netflix with 360.  10. 0.2% chance of failing. Most consumer products have a 2% fail rate.    Xbox360-  1. Netflix.  2. 3 year warranty    CONS:  PS3 -  1. New PS3's can't play PS2 games  2. 1 year warranty  3. Cost $150 to fix it if passed your 1 year warranty.      Xbox360 -  1. 33% fail rate meaning you can't play it and if you want to fix it you have to send it to microsoft for them to fix it and you will get it back approx. 3 WEEKS and has 33% of it failing again [PS3 has 0.2%]  2. Pay for online gaming $50 a year  3. Have to buy many add ons  4. Buy a recharger for controllers.  5. Cost more for HardDrive [60GB $100]  6. Buy Wifi [$100]      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    Those 2 games are basically the same thing on both consoles, no difference at all.|`|C2ZrBKJfaa	You are going to get opinions from both the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 fanboys the truth is, there are advantages and disadvantages to both the PS3 and the xbox 360    Playstation 3    Pro: Has both Ethernet, WiFi, free online play, and bluray  Con: most expensive console, game selection, and wireless controllers don't have user replaceable rechargeable batteries    Xbox 360    Pro: Less expensive, replaceable batteries in the wireless controllers  Con: RROD, Networking is Ethernet only, Can be noisy|`|HekFanRvaa	THE FUTURE of video is blu-ray... HD DVD is dead... so what are you gonna get???    PS3!!!!!!|`|hmZicrCYaa	This all depends, if your a hard core gamer PS3 is the way to go.  Xbox 360 is closer to in between still leaning closer to hard core though.  PS3 usually have the better graphics while Xbox 360 has more variety.  Me I'm Xbox 360 just because of the variety and both graphics are great.|`|tJYBep2Caa	PS3      its better|`|0e1e3b65b3c1de6ffdd4ebc197d8f144aa	get ps3, If u have a low budget to buy extra addons for the 360 for wifi and online gaming will work out the ps3 is cheaper also its more reliable and can do more than just play games.|`|H162bS7kaa	PS3 if you want to play rpg's and other more adult geared games and 360 or even Wii if you want to play more kid or family geared games.      PS3 online, free!  360 online, not free!   PS3 graphics are amazing and you get one of the best blueray players around.
AA12180617	IT WILL NEVER WORK OUTSIDE THE US!!    The Sidekick is a US only device as the phone systems in Europe and the USA are totally different using different frequencies and acces methods (3G is the same with AT&T though).  so as the Sidekick is not a 3G phone one bought in the US will not find a compatible network anywhere other than the US so its not  sold here.    Think of it as the US using AM medium wave radio and  Europe using VHF FM radio that is the extent of the differences between them!!|`|xLj4nilXaa	Sidekick's from the US don't work in the UK because of different programs etc. You should buy one on ebay|`|e08eab35a22f0c6bf7f5ba2c6c22c1f9aa	different system, aks in usa if it does work in the UK or not.

e3de46afbf7ed625219f371a01158664aa	I watch alot of fast action sports and movies and the 720p looks better.

vkzkXWfzaa	All formatting does is rewrite the root directory of the card. The root directory is the file that keeps a record of physically where on the card picture files begin and end. Deleting removes the start position for that picture from the root directory which allows that space to be overwritten.    Thats why recovery software can work it just ignores the root directory, interrogates the card and writes its own.    Have you protected any images on the card? Usually by using the key symbol. If so that memory space will no longer be available to the card, you will have to format the card, then review any pictures which are still there and individually remove the protection from each image.    It may be that some pages of memory have corrupted and the card knows it can't access them, or more likely you have used the card in another device and 'hidden' those pages from your camera.    The root directory on quality cards such as San Disk extreme 3 and Lexar cards is held in a re-programmable chip so if a page of memory corrupts it can use some spare memory (which all cards below 64Gb have), cheaper cards can't do this, your lucky that the whole card didn't corrupt.    Chris|`|0806e6e7cf26dee397f58421b5e679beaa	You must have changed image size, quality or file type (jpeg, raw)    Unless if you are comparing some of the memory in use, let's say you have 500 pics on it and another 500 free, picture sizes vary, if you take pics of a bird with the sky as background and there is a lot of blue the image size will be much smaller than another colourful picture, with 500 bird+sky pics you may get another 1500 free on the card.    When you format the card you actually erase everything, the card's file system will be clean as new, but when you delete only it's still there waiting to be overwritten by new files (pictures) and it can also be viewed (recovered) with file recovery programs.    If you format it regularly you may also prevent read/write errors.|`|HBNx77BBaa	Formatting the card in the camera takes you back to square one so you should be back to the original capacity. Deleting just removes individual files. The file space can get very fragmented that way.    I think you may have changed the the image quality level to a higher setting.    UPDATE: If you haven't changed any camera settings then I guess the card must have a problem. You could try running chkdsk on the card on a Windows PC. Put your card in a card reader and check which drive letter it is. From the Start menu select Run and  enter 'command' in the text box. In the command window type in the drive letter followed by a colon, for example M:    M: will then be showing at the start of the command line. Type chkdsk and press return. The card will then be scanned for errors and you'll be able to see if the space available matches the total disk space. If it doesn't then it's definitely time to replace that card.    If there's no problem with the chkdsk report try formatting the card using the PC and then reformatting it in the camera.

z9ucUe0laa	I had this problem a few weeks ago and this is how I fixed it.<br>  <br>  1) Uninstall bonjour<br>  2) uninstall Apple Mobile Device Manager<br>  3) uninstall quicktime<br>  4) uninstall itunes<br>  5) reinstall the newest version of itunes<br>  <br>  You must uninstall all of those things. Just uninstalling and reinstalling itunes isn't going to do the trick. I did that around 6 times before I gave up on it. After that your ipod touch should connect to itunes :)<br>  Hope that helps. If not then you can email me:<br>  lil_missdiss@yahoo.com|`|Jvmuri5naa	I don't know why this is happening exactly, but I think there may be a fault with your iPod. Try taking it back to whoever sold you it in the first place, not the manufacturer.<br>  <br>  You could try checking that there's nothing wrong with your iTunes or computer? Does anyone else you live with have an iPod? Try connecting theirs to see if your iTunes recognises that one... If not, then it could be your iTunes that's the problem.<br>  Just simply uninstall it and re-download it.

Now ii have heard this apparent reboot fault although ive never seen is personally, but what i will say is like all handsets with touchscreen they are liable to break very easy, the slightest drop will knock off the screen calibration etc, and to be honest its rival the iphone is even worse, However on the plus side its an amazing fone packed with features with a excellent camera.

iqFqBfBlaa	I was just googling it now, and found your question on google :)<br>  <br>  The boxes of Nintendo games from PAL territories all have a little coloured triangle on their spines, but in each territory it's a different colour (to show the region that copy of the game came from), <br>  Some common ones are: Green = UK, Pink = Spain, Red = France, Light Blue = Italy, Dark Blue = German, Brown = Australia. <br>  There are 49 different colours... <br>  As well as geographic region it is also to do with the language of the Box & booklets, though PAL region Nintendo games are made in Germany, the Triangles show the region that the game is shipped to. <br>  All PAL games work on PAL consoles; the DS isn't even region locked/PAL and it is cheaper to buy from Europe (and N. America), so some shops here in the UK import the games and sell them for full price! <br>  Different colours don't mean rarity or anything to do with if the game is for Girls/Children/etc, as is often stated (on Ebay as well as elsewhere). <br>  <br>  By any chance, is the pink triangled game Cooking Mama? Gee, I love that game... even though i've lost it in my pigsty room lol|`|KmHsLG8Paa	It is the region symbol probably. Whatever that girl said before me.

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	All the pic black and white except one spot may be done in some cameras, but it is best done with a photo editor. <br>  <br>  In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches.

The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.  Megapixel resolution is about potential photo size, not picture quality.<br>   <br>  The Canon A590IS is a slightly older model that is available everywhere at great sale prices. Think it is a great camera and a best buy. It has auto focus, a viewfinder, optical image stabilization, and uses rechargeable NiMH batteries.  <br>  <a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A590IS/A590ISA.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A5...</a> ...<br>  <a href="http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-powershot-8-0-megapixel.html" rel="nofollow">http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-po...</a> ...<br>   <br>  There is no one particular place to get great buys, but you may see something above that really helps you find the best buy.

Canon offers the WC-DC52 0.7x wide-angle lens, the TC-DC52A telephoto lens, the 250D 52mm closeup lens separately, along with the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them on the camera. (Note that the wide, tele, and macro lenses all need the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them to the camera.

SGQwTMWLaa	If boost mobile released a blackberry, the price would be a little much for most people. If they did a model like the new nextel BB, it would be around 500 to 600 dollars. There's no service agreements with boost, therefore they don't offer any discounts on phones. <br>  <br>  But, you could possibly get a Nextel blackberry and use it on boost mobile. However, I asked Boost if this would work, they replied with a no. But what I'm assuming is that Nextel does not want you to use they're blackberry on boost, because in theory it would work.<br>  <br>  I couldnt find a definitive answer on the web, but I did find a lot of people who asked the same question.

I think you mean Bullet Bill, you get them when you get a box it goes on random sometimes you get mushrooms sometimes you get invincibility...etc and you can get Bullet Bill which is like a rocket that takes you really fast to catch up with others when you are falling behind.<br>  <br>  You normally get it when you a are falling behind and hit a box, not all ways does it do it but you do get it.<br>  <br>  The player can collect Bullet Bills as items. Upon using the item, the user will transform into a near (if not completely) invincible Bullet Bill and rocket down the track on Auto-Pilot for a few seconds, knocking over any enemies and players in the way and stripping players of their items, similar to the Chain Chomp from Mario Kart: Double Dash!!. The Bullet Bill can only be received by the drivers on 6th-8th place (6th-12th in the case of Mario Kart Wii ). However, this item can sometimes be a curse. When on the trickier, narrower courses, these can sometimes lead racers up to a sharp turn or obstacle on the track and then end, possibly causing the kart to fall off the track and lose some of the spots gained using that item. Players can avoid this item if they are far ahead of the person using it, invincible, or out of the flight path. This is also one of four items which can be used to dodge a Blue Shell (the others being a Mushroom, a Starman, and Mario Kart Wii's Mega Mushroom).

HKGHeZguaa	Personally I hate Kodaks. For my Kodak in order to put pictures onto your computer, I HAVE to have to have the software. So if I want to put some pictures on my friends computer then you need to install the software. The Kodak software is extremely slow too. Sony isn't rated very well either. Here's what I would do. Both of these cameras cost about the same amount as the Nikon P80. The Nikon P80 has over 10mp and 18x optical zoom with image stabilization. This is a really nice camera for that price. Another option for you is that you could get a smaller point and shoot camera. I just ordered the Samsung SL310 which has over 13 mega pixels. Consumer Reports rates the picture quality of this camera EXCELLENT. No other point and shoot cameras picture quality is rated that high. I'm getting the whole thing for under $200. Maybe you should try looking into one of these cameras.|`|V6dz395kaa	2nd one, it's more portable. both are good though.

8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	Rule #1 in surround sound systems: Bose is overpriced, so avoid their products like the plague.<br>  <br>  Rule #2: Assemble it yourself.  There are some decend home theater in a box (HTIB) systems out there, but you will get more quality and performance for your money if you buy a receiver and speakers independent of each other.  For example, I went the budget route, buying an Onkyo TX-SR606 receiver and the Polk Audio RM6750 5.1 speaker set.  It cost me about $600.  (I'm a cheapskate.)<br>  <br>  Rule #3: If you choose to ignore Rule #2, as many do, never buy an HTIB based on a DVD or Blu-ray player.  Always buy a system with a straight a/v receiver as it's center piece.  Denon, Yamaha and Onkyo make good receiver-based HTIBs.  I prefer Onkyo simply because I think they are a better value.<br>  <br>  There are so many variables when choosing a home theater system.  You have power to consider, color, size, features like audio decoding, capabilities like whether or not it can handle HD bitrates.  The list goes on.  You can spend $20,000 on a home theater without too much trouble, so it really takes some effort to balance what you want with what you're willing to spend.|`|bRJAqc8Baa	I have put up thousands of flat screens and assemble hundreds of home theater set ups and I can honestly tell most of them are overkill.  Here is a good guide to help you.<br>  <br>  You should take a 15 x 15 room.  If you have a 5.1 system (which is all you need) you want 100 watt speakers (max).  You will only play those speakers at 50% of the maximum volume anyway.  This is your main concern, not the receiver.  The receiver does play a role in sound output, but you are only using it for your home, so most will work fine.<br>  <br>  We recommend the Yamaha, hands down.  It is a good system that we do not have compatibility issues with.  We have seen certain receivers not work well with different cable boxes and DVD players.  We have never had an issue with Yamaha.<br>  <br>  Conclusion:<br>  <br>  Get the yamaha with five speakers with 100 watts each and a subwoofer.  In-wall ceiling speakers are the best.|`|AA10434137	for the 'best' you should check out the Bose system.  If you have a Best Buy store near you, they have demos set up or you could go to www.bose.comj and see what they have to offer.

HKGHeZguaa	Consumer Reports doesn't recommend any of these but they do recommend the Samsung SL310. In fact that's the camera I just purchased for myself. It has over 13 mega pixels. Out of all the point and shoot cameras, this one is rated the best for image quality. The picture quality is rated EXCELLENT which none other cameras are. I used to have a Casio Exilim but I was reading and many other people had the same problem I had. They had a lens error which is extremely hard to fix. This is also the same thing that had happened to me. Trying to fix this may cost as much as buying a whole new camera.

I'd try to sell it to friends and family before putting it up on eBay or Craigslist.<br>  <br>  You may have paid $2,000 for it, but that's not what it's worth.  I'd ask $800 for it if I were you.  Personally, I would pay up to maybe $200 for that system.

You can try Halo3 she should be good at that.<br>  <br>  The only games suited really towards a 3yr old are games rated around EC(Early Childhood) this is because most games are difficult for 3 year olds who either A)Don't know how to read or B)Can read, but not that well. EC games are more developemental games like the V-Tech unfortunately, but can get her to learn how to get a good grasp on basic gameplay. There's a package floating around for 30 or so bucks that includes 3 good(not great, but good) 360 games. It has a Shrek game, Viva Pinata, and one other I don't remember. These should help her learn to play the system. <br>        Either that or teach her to read instructions and turn down the speech volume on that CoD please. I don't like seeing 3 yr olds swearing like a sailor.|`|kTMZE6iAaa	No offence...but I don't think any xbox 360 games are right for a child that young unless they are somewhat educational.

Navy Seals: Fireteam Bravo 2, and Fireteam Bravo.<br>  <br>  There are probably others too.<br>  <br>  Answer to second question:<br>  <br>  If you get a PSP 2000, this is what you get:<br>  No hardware problems, it saves you money, even when you buy the skype mic for it. Just make sure you have the remote control, or else the mic won't work. The same everything as the 3000, but not the built in mic. <br>  <br>  Best bet is a 2000.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!
FhXE8r1Faa	Things you will need:<br>  <br>  1. A hacked PSP.<br>  <br>  2. nitepr, which can be found at this link: <a href="http://sanik.imk.cx/nitePR/nitePR_revK.zip" rel="nofollow">http://sanik.imk.cx/nitePR/nitePR_revK.z...</a><br>  <br>  3. A computer.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Step 1: Download and extract the file. You can extract the file with WinRAR.<br>  <br>  Step 2: If you are using 3.71 M33, go to the 3.71 M33 folder. If you are on any other CFW go to the all other firmwares folder.<br>  <br>  Step 3: Go into USB mode on your PSP.<br>  <br>  Step 4: Copy the files in the seplugins folder to your PSP's seplugins folder. )If you don't have a seplugins folder just copy the seplugins folder straight to your PSP's root. The root is where the PSP and MP_ROOT folders are.)<br>  <br>  Step 5: Turn off your PSP completely, and turn it on again while holding the R trigger. Once recovery mode pops up go to plugins and enable it.<br>  <br>  Step 6: If you want to know how to use it, read the readme.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  PS: You could get banned from FTB2 for cheating so be careful!

SKkE3fK1aa	I recommend the Omnia because of these reasons.<br>  <br>  Personally, I am a Nokia Fan, but the 5800 is not a good phone! Yes, it is a touchscreen and a 3G handset and also a Smartphone but IT IS SLOW. The Omnia has the 600MHZ Processor while the 5800 has the 369 ARM11 Processor. The ARM11 is good for 240x320 phones such as the N95, N96, etc smartphones but the 5800 has a bigger resolution, thus requiring more processing power. Also, the Omnia, having a Windows Mobile OS and a better Processor, it will leave you loving your phone than complaining about a slow one.<br>  <br>  Believe me, it is better to have a fully-functional phone than a slow one.<br>  <br>  BTW, 5800 and Omnia are both Smartphones; Omnia = Windows Mobile and 5800 Symbian OS 9.4 (Nokia S60 5th Edition).|`|5agXk9ldaa	Nokia 5800 XpressMusic|`|McdHpomcaa	BETTER IS LG KP 500 because my mom have nokia and nokia brooked for a month,but my LG KP 500 is relay coll and I relay like it........

With the PS3 you can either send audio in "raw" bitstream format or decoded as PCM.  If you send PCM through an optical cable you will only get two channels of audio.  Switching your audio output to bitstream should fix it.

If it still doesn't work, then download a browser.  It's also possible that your carrier may be able to push a Blackberry browser to a your phone.

hmsMpECkaa	I don't know what you mean by anonymous number, maybe you mean anon. caller.  But, I don't think you can if the call came from outside of your network.  The call could have been from a land line and they used the new feature of blocking their info.  Mobile phones use towers, not physical lines that you can trace.  It would take multiple lines to trace the call and it has to be when the call is made and it would involve too much manpower.  I think you can pinpoint the area, but not the location.|`|aXYiOskmaa	you can try calling your service provider but i'm willing to bet it was a telemarketer. they were recently given cell numbers as well as land based numbers. usually, it's a computer call and it doesn't leave messages. i've had quite a few.|`|8gtVRmahaa	Its simple you can go to its franchise and ask them which person own this number.Simple.I have too found some persons like this its easy.|`|hR4Dfa4Taa	Call ur custumer support and ask them.

XIIiGv4Jaa	Is it a Big Ps2 or a Slim one? Either way, your first action would be think, do you have a warranty, and do you want to spend the money to ship it to Sony to fix it. If yes, call 1-800-345-SONY (7669). If no, then you have another option. If it is a slim ps2, open up the tray and clean off the laser VERY CAREFULLY. You can easily damage the laser, so this is important. If you have a fat PS2, unscrew the casing (there are some screws under the stickers, don't forget them) and blow all the dust out of the fan and heat sinks (metal ridges). You can also unscrew the disk tray and clean this laser as well. These should keep your playstation running for a good while longer, but when these things happen, it's a sign that the playstation has just about run it's course and needs to be replaced.

IGVi7x0saa	If you are connecting the converter box to the VCR, you must tune the VCR to the same channel, probably channel 3( if you live in a city that uses analog channel 3, you probably use channel 4 instead) that you used on  your TV when hooking the dtv converter directly.   Moreover, if you wish to record from your VCR you must record from channel 3.    If you are setting your VCR to record a program in the future, you set it to record from channel 3 during the time period you wish to record and you set the DIGITAL TV CONVERSION BOX to the channel carrying the program you wish to record.  Additionally, you<br>  must make sure the Digital TV conversion box is not programed to turn off for power saving purposes before the program you wish to record is broadcast.      Unfortunately,  if you wish to record programs <br>  from two or more different digital channels,  the option no longer exists.<br>  <br>  Exception:   If you purchace a dish network DTV Pal or any other <br>  dish network Digital Conversion box, these are actually programmable.<br>  Dish Network actually makes excellent over the air digital converter boxes.  No major electronics stores carry them, however, you must<br>  order them from dish network or try to buy them on craigslist, amazon,<br>  ebay, or other internet shopping source.   Dish Network is the most<br>  reliable source.<br>  However, you must set timers on that device to tune it to your selected digital channel  AND set your VCR to record from channel 3<br>  at the same selected time.    If you are used to programming VCR's<br>  it should not be difficult to learn.     <br>  <br>         In summary, with your current DTV converter, if you wish to record on the VCR,  set the VCR tuner to channel 3 and feed the VCR to the TV, set it to channel 3 and tune your desired TV station on the DIGITAL CONVERTER BOX.   You should be able to watch TV through the VCR and record on the VCR now.

Turn off the console.<br>     3. Turn on the console.<br>  <br>        Note If you are using an Xbox 360 Wireless Controller, turn on the console by using the Xbox Guide button on the controller. Wait for the guide light to indicate that the controller has linked to the console.<br>  <br>        Note Make sure that you use the player 1 controller when you do this. The player 1 controller is indicated by the upper-left quadrant light on the console.<br>     4. As the console starts, press and hold the Y button as you pull the right trigger.<br>  <br>        Note This action causes the Xbox Dashboard to reset the display settings to the default settings.

AA11056614	You can upgrade firmware to give Profile 2.0 (See link 1).<br>  <br>  That said, the 1500 is not a great player. Also Profile 1.1 is all you need unless you plan to chat with friends while watching a movie (note you MUST have the player connected to the internet to use Profile 2.0) or download games, etc. Basically Profile 2.0 is a bust. And by the way, it's the movie (disk) that determines whether Profile 2.0 applies ... and there aren't many.<br>  <br>  Think twice before buying Blu-ray ... you need an HDTV to benefit (and preferably at least 37" and connected to a good surround sound system. Plus disks are, on average, 30% more expensive.<br>  <br>  On the other hand a good Profile 1.1 player can make an excellent DVD upconverter and Blu-ray player. Many consider the Pioneer BDP51FD a great buy right (it;s on sale in the US for $260) now since it has top notch build quality, plus gives about the best picture of any player from both DVDs and Blu-ray. It's also considered an excellent CD player.
