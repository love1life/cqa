aKBqMLuhaa	WOW! tough one. <br>  Being that I was much more into big hair bands than grunge I'm gonna say Bon Jovi; but if you ask me tomorrow I might feel differently.<br>  <br>  BTW: I like Nevermind more now than I did when it came out. It had to grow on me where as Slippery When Wet was an instant hit (to me).|`|qThmcR1Aaa	As a Gen Xer, I'm supposed to say "Nevermind." But I never did like that album, and I still don't.<br>  <br>  In contrast, Bon Jovi irritated me when I was a teenager, but their music has grown on me now that I'm in my 30s. I like it just fine nowadays.<br>  <br>  I know, "Nevermind" changed the face of popular music. I recognize its cultural importance. It's just not my taste.|`|yS61H04haa	No brainer.... Nevermind. <br>  <br>  <br>  Why? I destest...no wait.... I DETEST Bon Jovi and their cheesy pop rock. I like the raw emotion that Nirvana, Cobain and the album had.|`|euZRbiA2aa	Bo Jovi why because i dont care for nirvana.<br>  <br>  EDIT hey gnab im the same didnt like bon jovi till my late 30s must mellow when you get older.|`|b7FbWNmlaa	oh my god that's like asking us to chose between chocolate and ice-cream, both are the best, but sometimes you want one and sometimes you want the other, but in a crisis both will do the job!!|`|7bIrMvziaa	Both are very overrated but I would say Nevermind because it is probably more influential.<br>  Both bands have better albums than the said ones though|`|vidiDXxBaa	Nivana's 'Nevermind'. Why? Because Bon Jovi SUCKS. End of discussion.|`|HFJd3e1laa	bon jovi. i just always prefered him in general|`|XHwhhSgaaa	Nevermind. no contest.|`|r0ngxMWSaa	Nirvana for me<br>  <br>  I don't really like bon jovi, i prefer gritty over girly|`|gO3aZ72baa	nirvanas nevermind<br>  <br>  coz its better!<br>  <br>  :P<br>  <br>  xxx|`|vZUHSNn6aa	neither, facelift now thats what you call an album|`|625IwsqAaa	Nevermind, hands down.<br>  Bon Jovi's music has always sounded dated and cheesy to me. I can listen to it and know it's from the 80's.......blehhh. Nirvana is timeless and doesn't sound like it's from the 90's.|`|AA11497797	Nevermind. Bon Jovi took what people were already doing and (sort of) made their own groove. Nirvana changed the face of music and Nevermind has a sound all of its own.|`|zHZOxfbVaa	nirvanas nevermind it sounds better|`|yVZR0N0Haa	Nirvana, Bon Jovi is POP rock|`|FDt7cC8haa	Bon Jovi's "Slippery When Wet"<br>  why?<br>  I never cared for Nirvana...|`|UDAeKt7Eaa	Slippery When Wet. <br>  <br>  It has higher song quality than Nevermind does. Nirvana is far from being my favorite band, although I do like them to an extent.

5czjPzaVaa	I definitely agree. Thank God someone else also thinks so. I don't see why people brag about how amazing she is. Why in the world is she being compared to Whitney and Mariah? I have no clue. <br>  <br>  Yeah, she can sing. But there's nothing really special about her voice. I hate that nasal sound. And sometimes she struggles to hit those high notes in bleeding love live so it's like she's whining.|`|De8z6qH4aa	Forget her voice, get that chick a tampon because she keeps bleeding, keeps keeps bleeding.|`|pKrsOPOkaa	disagree. i love her !

I dunno how those froobs do it.<br>  I think Immortal Technique is a good example of a rapper. Black Thought is a good example of an MC.|`|HL8W9yU6aa	All seriousness in play: LMAO @ Ski<br>  <br>  I always look at them both the same, so i'd be interested in what the answers provide.|`|O6FgX9lVaa	anyone can be a rapper, but only the greats can be MCs.

It's found at <a href="http://www.learn-magic-online.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.learn-magic-online.com.</a> Here's one that I grabbed from it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Switching Cards Card Trick<br>  <br>  The magician asks for a spectator to take a card. He then tells the spectator to place their hand over it to ensure that he can not do anything to it. The top card no the deck is taken, waved over the spectator's hand, the turned over to reveal that the two have changed places.<br>  <br>  How It's Done<br>  <br>  So how is this great trick performed? The secret is simple: a double-card lift. If you don't already know how to perform a double-card grip, you will need to learn one now, as several card tricks require it.<br>  <br>  All you need to do is put one card on top of another whille making it look like just one; this is much easier to do if you slightly bend the card back.<br>  <br>  Once you've got the double-card lift down, you're going to need to apply it to the trick. You will also need to memorize the top card.<br>  <br>  Ask for the spectator to choose any card that they want, memorize it, and not show it to you. While they are doing that, (and it might only take about a second) you will need to slightly raise the card with your pinky.<br>  <br>  Now that your spectator is content, take the card from them, and very quickly place it under the top card. This will take some practice, but that's not exactly what your audience is looking for, and thus you will most likely get by with it.<br>  <br>  Using a double-card lift, show the audience their card, with the top card on top so that they know it is still there. Set both cards back down on the deck, and slide off the real top card, and tell your spectator to keep it under their hand; remember, right now they think they are keeping the card they choose under their hand, while it is really still on the top of the deck.<br>  <br>  Lift up the back of the spectator's choosen card so that only you can see it saying something like, "Okay, the next card is the [fill in card]." In a casual movement, wave the choosen card over the spectator's hand, and tell them the two have just switched. They will now discover that what you say is true.<br>  <br>  Tips<br>  <br>  *To show the spectator the false card, use a triple-card lift of a duplicate top card from another deck.<br>  <br>  *Make sure that your spectator doesn't turn over the card you give them!|`|RaBFHLk5aa	This magic is very simple and easy to learn.<br>  You just need a coin and you can show this magic anytime ;-)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.magictube.coo.my/coin-trick-tutorial-coin-thru-hand-trick,177.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.magictube.coo.my/coin-trick-t...</a>|`|uAqgwKgGaa	just share<br>  hope this can help your effort<br>  <br>  Beginner's Guide To Magic Tricks!<br>  <br>  >><<<a href="http://tinyurl.com/magicsbook<<" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/magicsbook<<</a><br>  <br>  keep learn n success for you|`|BosXJUoFaa	i would but cant be bothered
G26O8ecfaa	2nd Grader asks Pregnancy Questions<br>  <br>  In a second grade class, a little girl asks, "Teacher, can my Mommy get pregnant?", "How old is your mother, dear?" asks the teacher. "Forty." she replies. "Yes, dear, your mother could get pregnant." The little girl then asks, "Can my big sister get pregnant?" "Well, dear, how old is your sister?" The little girl answers, "Nineteen." "Oh yes, dear, your sister certainly could get pregnant." The little girl then asks, "Can I get pregnant?" "How old are you, dear?" The little girl answers, "I'm seven years old."

So, he went bear hunting. He spotted a small brown bear and shot it. There was then a tap on his shoulder, and he turned around to see a big black bear. <br>  <br>  The black bear said: "You've got two choices. I either maul you to death or we have rough sex." <br>  <br>  Frank decided to bend over. Even though he felt sore for two weeks, Frank soon recovered and vowed revenge. He headed out on another trip where he found the black bear and shot it. <br>  <br>  There was another tap on his shoulder. <br>  <br>  This time a huge grizzly bear stood right next to him. The grizzly says: "That was a huge mistake, Frank. You've got two choices. Either I maul you to death or we have REALLY rough sex." <br>  <br>  Again, Frank thought it was better to comply. Although he survived, it would take several months before Frank finally recovered. Outraged he headed back to the woods, managed to track down the grizzly and shot it. <br>  <br>  He felt sweet revenge, but then there was a tap on his shoulder. He turned around to find a giant polar bear standing there. <br>  <br>  The polar bear says: "Admit it, Frank, you don't come here for the hunting, do you?"|`|POqwp3Fiaa	A young businessman had just started his own firm.

xUs56AwOaa	As a Cancer, you should know that Cancers take everything as a threat to themselves, whether it was meant to or not.  Essentially they take everything personally and he may have been hurt or something, maybe he read a little too much into your words and he was hurt.  I would say step forward and be forward with him, because Cancers will tend to wait it out and see what happens, but if you don't talk to him about it, he won't do anything.|`|g8QMrSzwaa	ok this is exactly like my friend's case: for now lets keep the sunsign aside. my friend is a cancer though... and he is like ur boyfriend..  .. he had told me once that he was not sure if she liked him so he was giving hints for her to pick it up.. and she sometimes acted as if she knew he liked her and sometimes like as if there is nothing between them.. so he was confused and din't know how to approach her... and when she said that she was getting proposals he was like "ok i think its the end. we may not continue. if she is saying they are looking for a guy it means she is telling indirectly she is not interested in me and wants to marry someone else."<br>  <br>  in ur case.. its the same.... he is giving u hints that he likes u and he dreams about you and expects the same response from you like you know to say something nice back to him.. when you sounded cold he felt that maybe she never liked me .. so he tried distancing u. <br>  <br>  now coming to your sun sign, cancers.. if u like someone you really take it slow on a relationship... like your feelings for each other don't come out so quickly .. the best would be if you approach him first saying you like him or he approaches you first...

It's all about his voice!!!  The guy can sing ...he may even be the best on the show right now...<br>  Sure, he's really nice...and he may not have star style...but they can give him a makeover.  It's his amazing voice that is winning him all his votes.  <br>  He is my favorite right now and the one I am hoping will win. If you don't like him, that's fine.  Everyone is entitled their own opinions.  <br>  I like Adam too but not just because of his style or because he's a "bad boy" like you said (which I don't even think he is).  I like him because I like his voice and he's a great performer.  <br>  I don't really like Megan...she's pretty and she has a unique voice, but she doesn't do anything for me.  Ps. I don't understand how you think she has a "rock style".  She's far from rock.  She sounds more like Duffy or Adele.

Or maybe they just need to have an age limit on myspace where it's only for younger kids, and leave facebook for the older more mature people.

I saw Brokeback Mountain and I am not "into" cowboy meat.<br>  <br>  Not that there is anything wrong with it if you are Revenginator...I mean you are what you eat, and your avatar is a cowboy, so aparently you eat cowboy meat.<br>  <br>  No worries, I still think people fear you because of the avatar pulling the heart out of its chest. It's not quite as fashionable as some pink leather chaps would be, but it does add the bad *** gay cowboy mystique.|`|fbbb1919a6be870cfe6b62811bef94cbaa	No, but I'd really like to have some cowgirl meat.|`|iIWWeD7Taa	Word around the campfire is that ur cowboy meet is really just an Oscar Meyer "Little Smokie" in disguise|`|HCL7FpTqaa	Medium rare please.

wDJRyzE9aa	No sorry.  The ability or inability to spell has no correlation to intelligence.|`|rEWZWZi5aa	at times<br>  but it spells a lot of words the American way instead of the correct english way|`|kqk1Mqqsaa	nah, 'cause half the time it misses stuff anyways because you misspell a word and it ends up being another real word.  like when you leave the l out of public and it ends up being pubic (it's so funny when my teachers do that!)<br>  <br>  plus if you really meant to spell it that way then it's sorta annoying when it underlines it.  too distracting for ADHD people like me!  :)|`|QuokZhuqaa	No not really.

Yes they do act quite un-ladylike or without class in their videos/music. I think they do what they do namely for the money but yes some of the women you mentioned are hoes.. it's very hard to determine and in fact the whole hip hop industry does have quite a few hoes but don't forget about the women that are real and that don't act like hoes like rihanna or alicia keys.. or ashanti.|`|zp8gLEz8aa	what kinda question is this? :\<br>  lmao.<br>  trina is a ho.<br>  listen to her song "look back at me"<br>  talkin bout "slap it in my face, shove it down my throat"<br>  psshh, and lil kim's been a ho since...forever.<br>  she was fukcin bigg.

Pretty simple really.<br>  <br>  -Nov|`|zhjXam01aa	what song?|`|AlJ557gHaa	because when you forget something, it really bugs you.  or they are trying to look up the song|`|t0K6Haoyaa	that's what Yahoo is from. I do it all the time on here b/c I like to get the real answer from someone really quick instead of going look on a bunch of items that hopefully maybe get the answer.|`|CRuxWsi0aa	Because they want to know what tthe song is so they can listen to it again. Google doesn't always work.|`|3RmwBjLwaa	Why do people ask why others ask about who sings this song?|`|FdixIDR1aa	They want to know who sang a song?|`|u9NxzS1Uaa	cause they dont know how to search for stuff cause they are dumb|`|wvPwc4PGaa	because they don't know|`|sJNoTGQVaa	because they don't know who does and hopes somebody on here does.<br>  <br>  Why are you stupid?|`|iSq3mh3waa	because maybe they don't know who sang that song.<br>  No complaints though.

AA11518036	South Park.
2l4pDvwwaa	Yes...That is very true...His 50 pound costume included a couple of real lion fur skins (PETA was not around yet...& noone said that the lions were killed for the skins..so calm down, they may have been harvested from lions who died of natural causes) His wig hair obviously was not from lion hair but probably was of natural human hair.|`|IDuA6JCxaa	Never heard of that rumor.  Could be true, but I personally doubt it.  PETA would have slammed the Wizard of Oz if it were true.<br>  <br>  Just an edit: It never matters with PETA.  They'll go back through history and find whatever they can be anti towards.  Throw eggs at an old Oz movie poster.|`|fAMpwF3Aaa	No it wasn't|`|B43x5RF8aa	No, not true at all.|`|y8WBcehmaa	The fur was made of real lion pelts, not the mane. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And to the poster above Peta was founded in 1980, wizard of oz came out in 1939, do the math. Peta was founded because of incidents of animal cruelty in earlier years

NqcnAnC1aa	They're definitely not rock like Fall Out Boy or the likes.  They're more like soft rock/pop.  <br>  But your friends shouldn't be laughing at you.  The Fray are an amazing band and make better music than a lot of bands out there...including Fall Out Boy, in my opinion.|`|eNR2iot8aa	Maybe they laughed cause it's girly rock, but who cares they make nice songs.
y8WBcehmaa	it's not funland, it's adventureland<br>  <br>  and<br>  <br>  you'd like supertroopers<br>  Grandma's Boy<br>  Forgetting Sarah Marshall<br>  Wet Hot American Summer<br>  American Pie<br>  The Girl Next Door<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I just watched sex drive, and andy and randy are my new favorite characters "do you wear thong underpants?", "is your mom hot too?". "our ***** our huge, you can see them from space"|`|y2XKYhsyaa	its not really like those, but its a very funny movie: Forgetting Sarah Marshall.|`|syZZflNpaa	Definitely Accepted or Pineapple Express! =]|`|ShRdColXaa	Maybe "Grandmas Boy"<br>  Its a great movie!<br>  <br>  Oh and Funland. It comes out soon
jJLc6uG1aa	I agree, the movie was terrible.  I don't know if the actors could have been better if there was better direction and production quality, maybe they could have been.  It was a disaster for such a good book.  <br>  I'm hoping that they do a MUCH better job with the second movie.  The actors will be the same but maybe they'll spend some money to make this one better.  I laughed out loud at some of the scenes and was really disappointed.|`|14UfFR3qaa	The movie was ok, and it is rather corny, and they left some special effects out, like when edward is carrying bella and running through theforest at top speed, her hair just stays hanging down on her face, its supposed to be blowing about in the wind!|`|OzAcn50qaa	i think robert was great although i do agree they should have picked a better bella but i do think they should make new moon and don't forget they are using a different director for new moon|`|LXWWbZNAaa	i prefer harry potter and twilight movie was kind of cheesy with the effects like when he "glitters"|`|1JMwV9giaa	i <<<<<<<<<<<333333333333333 twilight!! lol<br>  and as far as the cast, they def. coulda picked a better looking edward!<br>  but they did good with jacob =))))) he's freakin hot!!!!!!!!!!!!  lol|`|WqJk2yJiaa	i totally agree w/ you on Edward and Bella,  but they did a great job of picking Jacob, Taylor is so devoted to this movie when rob and Kristen are off running around drinking and smoking. they could have done so much better, especially w/ the special effects. but if they screw up eclipse on June 30th, 2010(in theaters) i will be so angry b/ that is my favorite book in the series. UGH! they better do a good job, but i still kinda like the move but only if i am having a good time w/ my friends seeing it.|`|rsZs0AuJaa	I think Twilight is really overrated, its mediocre at best. The characters are stock characters and it was designed so that it would be successful without any real writing and just try to romance tween girls into a fantasy world, make the standards higher for all men so girls only like 14 year old guys who wear their Fall Out Boy shirts that they got from Hot Topic.<br>  <br>  Harsh?<br>  Yes.<br>  True?<br>  Yes.

It's such a great service, honestly. It's like having the world right at your fingertips. There are experts from literally every walk of live gracing this website with their presence. <br>  <br>  It's sad to see you go. Yahoo Answers is what you make of it. Perhaps you have an addiction problem. Well guess what? It's not difficult to give into your vices and then sign up for a new account.<br>  <br>  Or, perhaps you are sick and tired of it. But one day, you'll ask yourself "well gee, how do I do this" and "how do I do that" and you won't know where to search. It might be something that you feel EVERYBODY else is well-versed on, but you aren't. You might be able to take advantage of this service in such a manner. You don't have to deactivate your account.<br>  <br>  Or it might be for something else. But I thought that I'd address two distinct and recurring possibilities.<br>  Good luck.|`|T40nPjg3aa	GAH!

Tens of thousands are in jail for getting busted with residue of a joint-has over crowded our prisons.|`|AA11518036	Yes and taxed just liked tobacco and alcohol.|`|m1JyB08Raa	yes,it would solve all the governments money problems in a month with the taxes it would collect.|`|89FgPZ9Waa	NO<br>  Weed is harmful to our body and is addicting.... so NO|`|yJZeRu5Vaa	no, stores like wegmans and rite aid would run private dealers out of buisness|`|XlFMwaasaa	next answerer is straight edge|`|JZMfUDylaa	YES!!<br>  here are my reasons:<br>  Weed is just a plant made from God. Tobacco and booze is 10 times more dangerous than weed. People who smoke weed aren't criminals for smoking. If tobacco is legal and people can smoke it (tobacco is more dangerous) then weed should be legal as well. Police are arresting more smokers than the real criminals such as rapist, murderers, and thieves. The main reason why weed was made illegal was because you can make hemp out of clothes, rope, and countless of other things. The other companies who make other materials that make your clothes, furniture, and other things would have gone out of Business. Weed can be very beneficial to sick people. People who have AIDs, Cancer, Even people who are anorectic. It doesn't cure these illness but helps in so many ways. If you would like to learn the true facts of marijuana then please go on norml.com|`|0F47hNHHaa	i would say no because it's just another form of tax, another way to tax you, prices would go up. wouldnt be some pot heads growing it anymore, it would be people getting paid by the government (and you knowhow over paid they are), people would still get it off the streets because it would be cheaper, and their names wouldn't be on a list that they could use to against you like the days of booze and prohibition. now if they legalized it with out taxing it, and with out paying people 60$ an hour to grow and sell, just let the dealers deal it I may be for it, but you realize if they make it legal it would be just another way for the government to keep tabs on you and tighten their grip of control.|`|7LWDRI2Uaa	Yes I do believe it should be legal, It may be a 'gateway' drug but no more than alcohol is. Prohibition fuels organized crime, gangs kill people, hard drugs kill people, alcohol kills people, weed doesn't..it makes you lazy.I've hardly ever touched weed myself because I personally think it tastes disgusting and smells just as bad but I would rather it be legal than alcohol, Ive never seen a woman beaten half to death by a man high on weed but I have seen it by a man that was drunk. There are worse evils than this stupid plant.|`|Tv8cuXmtaa	Yes<br>  I personally would not smoke it, but weed is much less harmful then cigarettes, and any other drug that is legal today. Laws don't seem to stop anybody I know from smoking it. <br>  I could be persuaded to think differently with a good logical point. But i think my reasoning is good|`|TLrRt8kOaa	I think it should but too a certain amount<br>  Couple of days ago I watch on National Geographic Channel that they say alittle weed is actually good for you but just don't overdose it|`|w9WsA8NNaa	If everybody will be doing it...honestly, no, because imagine trying to talk to a bunch of high people in public! Ridiculous!|`|J30Gh5O6aa	no, its just an excuse. the way i see it is if you have to smoke week to be happy/have fun exc- then u need help.|`|A6MQuHfbaa	No, it should be decriminalized.|`|4MVIJvbiaa	F*CK NO.!<br>  <br>  That sh*t is bad for you.<br>  It kills.|`|cecdbc877f6fff9ded598d3e06b00188aa	no.<br>  because.|`|UVOpjpkyaa	Yes, but don't expect me to use it.|`|bgd2Utboaa	no america's already plenty messed up|`|3866f8902aa539f737e362949ec4f25baa	Yes, its no worse than alcohol and in some cases better|`|QKdpO2Wtaa	only for medical purposes<br>  I don't think people should just get high for no reason.|`|jgNFA3HDaa	no cuz its messed up crap.|`|AA11109457	NOOO !<br>  <br>  that sh*t is bad for you.|`|YZZW7Ycuaa	ABSOLUTELY-weed does no harm if you are in a private place and in a safe place.  I don't reccomend doing it all the time like "pot heads" do because then theres no real point to life, you would be high all the time.  However, I feel that it's recreational and gives something to do for those who are young and do not have children to watch over and set a good example for.  weed is harmless and enjoyable-helps to put you to sleep and/or relax =) the only down side is weight gain frum the muchiess|`|EUdCd3Uxaa	yep i do i mean the only side effect it has is weight gain now ask urself this take beer and weed how many people die each year from each 1 of them beer wins they a person killed every 15sec cause of beer and stoners they too stoned to put a dent in a mudhole let along kill some1|`|HG7USP9Faa	I thought there would be way more yes responses what with all the super liberals and hippies on yahoo answers. <br>  <br>  smoking marijuana responsibly is no more harmful then drinking responsibly. I think making it legal for people over the age of 21 with careful restrictions is a perfectly reasonable option.<br>  <br>  I don't do any drugs or smoking or any of that at all.i have no stake or bias in this.<br>  <br>  BTW,kids think it isn't harmful because cigarettes are loaded with tar and all sorts of other crap.They are partially correct,but overuse of anything is harmful.|`|4g2EAbtMaa	Yes, I do. And no, I don't smoke pot. But our government spends billions of dollars trying to stop something that will never be stopped. If it was legal, that money could go to something else, like the appalling education system in this country. Farmers could make money growing it. Factories would hire people to process it. There would be jobs wholesaling it. Retailers make money selling it. And the government gets to tax the crap out of it. It's a financial win-win situation. And given a choice, I'd much rather be on the road with the stoned guy whose driving 20 mph and thinks he's driving 70 than the drunk who is driving 70 mph and thinks he's going 20.|`|48lxS4pPaa	yep.. too many reasons to list.  it's recreational us is minor compared to its industrial application.<br>  <br>  wow.. all the haters.  don't you know alcohol is worse for you? alcohol is legal.  why shouldn't marijuana be? and to say that 'our country is messed up enough'.  idk if you know, but most people smoke pot! also, it is bad for you like cigarettes.  idk where young people get the idea it's not.  it is actually worse.|`|AA11197832	Yes...Ive had plenty of experience with "weed" and to me it posts no hazard.  I mean if it did why would Doctor's prescribe to there patients right? Right.. Therefore it should be legalized and beleive it or not it is in certain states and countries.  Dont ask where cuz if I knew Id move there jk.|`|3GIykj9Saa	Well honestly, everyone who wants it gets it. And normally if you are in a small town or something they won't arrest you for it. I think weed is bad, but what's the point of it being illegal if everyone can get it so easily?|`|XxnOIOaxaa	Certainly. Eight years ago it was reported that weed cured brain cancer in mice. What the hell happened? I mean nine years ago. I forgot it's 2009.|`|gMsR5oWDaa	weed actually have some health benifits!!!!!!<br>  <br>  but it also causes bad things so IDK!!!!!|`|sq2EnZK4aa	yes & no. yes because,well...some people need it to stay sane.no because then people would blow all their money on it.A total waste of money.also i could scare people high as f*ck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|ZUNmcAmmaa	Yeupp.<br>  It would make are economy WAY better. & its not that bod for youuu. Its non addictive.|`|SGrd8ubpaa	because it can mess up your life, i think it should totally not be legal|`|X7SVHR3Gaa	yes,it acts as a pain releiver & it doesnt kill you like cigarettes.|`|wBJdh6Njaa	yes, dont panic its organic haha it says it all :)|`|NKKdfoXWaa	no.<br>  drugs are bad.|`|AGnXddI9aa	Yes<br>  <br>  Here's Why:<br>  <br>  #1<br>  Its Not Dangerous <br>  You can't overdose on marijuana, nobody has ever died from marijuana, ever, in history. Not 1 person. But this year over 400,000 people are going to die from smoking cigarettes, and 100,000 will die from alcohol. Once again, not 1 single person will die from marijuana this year. NOT ONE. <br>  <br>  It doesn't make people violent or have any bad effects. They already legalized it in Canada and Amsterdam for example, and there was no rise in crime. It doesn't cause lung cancer either like cigarettes do, 2 years ago they did the largest study on marijuana ever and concluded it does not cause cancer. There were some before it which said it did cause cancer, but they didnt study as many people as they did this time, so its more conclusive. Below is credible links to verify this.<br>  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/25/AR2006052501729_pf.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/con...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/04/070417193338.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/200...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/lung-cancer/news/20060523/pot-smoking-not-linked-to-lung-cancer" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/lung-cancer/news/20...</a><br>  <br>  Even our own government website on cancer, The National Cancer Institute says that marijuana does not cause cancer, but helps slow tumor growth, which is one reason cancer patients get it prescribed now.<br>  <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Support/marijuana" rel="nofollow">http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/facts...</a><br>  <br>  #2<br>  It Costs Us Money<br>  It costs each taxpayer $100 a year. This april, all tax payers will have to pay taxes, and thats how much it will cost us. Last year it cost them $14 billion to arrest, prosecute, and incarcerate marijuana users. There are 138 tax payers, so thats how I got that number. I realize some people pay more of that bill then others, but if you divide it up individually, thats what you get. So this april, everyone you know who pays taxes, in theory, will be giving the government $100 of their hard earned money to lock up people who pose no threat to their safety in the first place.<br>  <br>  #3<br>  It Could Erase Debt<br>  California is now considering legalizing it and a bill has been proposed because they think it may be a harmless way to reduce their state debt.<br>  <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29374351/" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29374351/</a><br>  <br>  #4<br>  Marijuana Does Not Make You a Failure<br>  I'm 27, I own 2 businesses. I'm very successful. I'm not going to post personal links on here, but just send me a message and I'll show you my youtube account, my myspace, with videos and pictures of me in Thailand and other countries, living on both coasts, websites I own and the value of them. I live in different countries half the time and have the videos to prove it. I smoke weed all the time and I worked for Google, USPS, Cisco, and a lawfirm. I teach other people how to set up businesses online and physically. People who probably think they are too good to smoke marijuana. Isn't that ironic? So it doesn't make you stupid either. It doesn't affect your athletic ability obviously if Michael Phelps can smoke it and be a world class champion. I think just smoking it occassionally does not harm you, it's when you are doing all day long and love it so much so that's all you do, that's when its a problem. But it could never take lives like tobacco and alcohol. So there is no good argument from the other side on this debate, marijuana is not bad, end of story.<br>  <br>  #5 <br>  Its Not a Gateway Drug<br>  There is no such thing as Gateway Drugs, only Gateway People. The people who try marijuana first, then move on to other drugs, are the ones who are prone to doing the other drugs anyways. If marijuana didn't exist, then they would go straight to the pills, or straight to extacy, before moving on to crack or heroin for example. It's in their nature to want to try everything, wether marijuana is in the picture or not, they are going to end up at heroin or crack or wherever anyways. I know alot more people who have only smoked pot and they're in their 20's and 30's now.<br>  <br>  Why is it illegal?<br>  Because it's difficult to tax since if they legalized it many people could just grow their own. It's much easier to grow than tobacco, so any average joe could do it, so this is why it's still illegal in the USA. Also, because the other half of the country still believes it's bad and are not really educated correctly on the subject.|`|QWeh9Xmoaa	no!!!!<br>  drugs are terrible|`|80fmX78yaa	nope!|`|jb0MLVMuaa	no|`|wp2LaPxdaa	no|`|i4QPLfEVaa	That's a hard one. I can see both sides of the argument.|`|5vgnrvcmaa	It is legal in some places.|`|5faa7df1dbf6be8d22c72f7cca966e7baa	Yes and all other drugs.  The drugs would be government regulated so it would be of good quality and not cut with poisons, antifreeze, drano and so forth.  Sale of the drugs would be taxed and those taxes could go back into the treasury.  More importantly, I would make buyers have to sign for their purchases,  just like you do for prescription medications.  The only difference would be the purchase of any drugs would become a public record, so  parents, employers, prospective employers, coaches, preachers, teachers, your family physician, other family members, and friends could view your record, see what you bought, when you bought it, and how much it cos.  Drugs being legal would help halt the use of drugs in this country because very few people would be willing to make their personal business known publicly in a world where drug users are ridiculed.   This, however, is just my opinion.|`|qcflj3umaa	No, It is a drug, and makes you high, and causes you to have poor judgement. It controls your life, and can eventually kill you. I don't agree with any drugs including Tobacco and Ciggarettes. Drugs cause huge problems, and make you do things you would not normally do, that are wrong. The only drug I even think the only "drug" that should be legal is Alcahol in moderation (one to two glasses per person)|`|De8z6qH4aa	NOOO.<br>  I don't take away the good things in your life, why should you take the good things away from mine? Lmfaoo.|`|9iNCQkWlaa	oh ya sure just when they're making herbicides illegal|`|CmJwqeJ5aa	Yes... so i can make some money
NQ3eETlYaa	Yes. If I can't win, accomplish, or beat something (ex. a game), then I get really pissed. Also, when I wake up (after a nap), then I get pissed at the smallest things: It's hard for me to get my cell (when I get it I throw it cause I'm so mad) or the car door was shut, when I'm the only one in it (I'll kick open the door and cuss). LOL. :)<br>  <br>  Also, if I don't get math...which is probably every other lesson. :P I hate math.|`|9iNCQkWlaa	i'm on my 40th dumbazz question and you're asking DO I GET FRUSTRATED EASILY ....NOOOOO!|`|fC5X8swbaa	yeppers. xD|`|KQJPWWjeaa	Yes.  Especially when I'm on Y!A and the questions are lame.|`|7HEZhx46aa	Yes. I have no patience.|`|2624d3bf8e4e63e26e8d8d37caca1505aa	yes|`|556f6a84a1e72fa5f9fa440c37251fe4aa	Yeah...though I really think at this point, it's not so much that I *get* frustrated, so much as it is that I never get to *calm down* and be *Non* Frustrated.  o_o  If that makes sense.<br>  <br>  It's rather like the situation with my shoulders right now.  Both of them have been overrotated and dislocated repeatedly.  And now, it's got to the point to where their being *in pain* is the ordinary, normal state, and I have to do something to not be in pain.  Usually that something involves my taking *one more* tylenol or something than what the label says....<br>  <br>  But that's where I am with regards to frustration.  Already there, constantly, and typically.  I have to actively do stuff to not be frustrated, and it usually doesn't give me more than an hour or two's worth of relief from it.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps: remember, things can always get worse (well, until people start dropping dead, but hey).|`|aitD50yuaa	Yes, <br>  I get frustrated with my parents easily, espically when my mom just gets back at me, and I blow, when she says Bill is gay, and all this stuff since she knows I like them so freaking much it's not funny, What I say back XD<br>  <br>  But then it stops and then it's over lol, Its' stupid what we argue over, I mean we all know bill is not gay I just think she likes when i get mad to see what I say. and I come back hard and I know it's my mom then later on I go I'm sorry but Bill's not gay lol when its' all over with.|`|c7GGP3Qlaa	I try not to be.lol<br>  But sometimes I fall prey to frustration just like everybody else.lol|`|DhUMjZxtaa	all the time<br>  <br>  wish i didnt|`|ZnXk0nlYaa	Yup !|`|cdpy5iv5aa	Yes|`|cYFAo75Yaa	no...|`|4MVIJvbiaa	Oh yes.

m1JyB08Raa	only the 28% of republicans that voted for mcshame.|`|36PrVK7Oaa	Because he is a socialist and fraud is inherint in socialism. Also he is a democrat who collaborated with America's enemies by spreading islamofacist propaganda to try to engineer America's defeat in IRAQ for their own political advantage.<br>  *<br>  The democrats have done with the communists could never do, destroy America's wealth. Maybe the communists have taken over the democratic party to destroy freedom from within.|`|QKdpO2Wtaa	I don't think everyone hates him.|`|2ca8aeddbc2242e1f6bb6f0d7dc98cc7aa	Not everyone hates him<br>  I don't hate him.|`|556f6a84a1e72fa5f9fa440c37251fe4aa	Honestly, they don't.  I think it's just the political obsessives buying ad time and complaining loudly that their "boy" didn't win.  Basically, the same clique of pampered rich men that got G.W. Bush "elected" is having trouble coping with the idea that maybe they *don't* own the world after all, don't own the White House, and that they might, maybe, just have to take a loss for the good of the people around them.<br>  <br>  In plainer terms....we have more than a few imbeciles who don't *want to* admit they were wrong these past 8 years, and that times are going to have to change if life is to get better again for anyone.  They can't bring themselves to admit it, so they blame the guy who got elected fair and square in a landslide.<br>  <br>  Like I said, they're obsessed.  o_o  And they have too much time and ad money on their hands...|`|LgHQI1lEaa	Perhaps everyone's still all upset that their canidate of choice didn't win.<br>  <br>  I personally liked him from the start, and he's doing a great job despite the mess he was left with from our previous president.|`|At8D5Xu2aa	Everyone doesn't.

Oh, and the pointless Obama trading cards.  I mean, come on, how can you have trading cards of one person?  Oh, and how he signs autographs after he addresses Congress.  And, I also dislike anyone who believes in corporate welfare.  Let's see, he also appointed a tax cheat as the Secretary of the Treasury.<br>  <br>  Edit:  And I didn't vote for McCain or any democrat permutation of his name.  I voted Libertarian because I am strongly against the corporate welfare that has bipartisan support.

e81cb58413964229d6af24dd65970eadaa	you know, maybe congress should retract daylight savings time and we would go back to being just like the rest of the world.  That extra hour of daylight in America has to be contributing to global warming!!!  It's those damn crazy liberals that put the extra hour in there to begin with, now they complain about warming!!  What did they think would happen?<br>  <br>  In case there are some out there that don't already know, I am being facetious.|`|wbhqShh6aa	we receive the same amount of sunlight each day that we would whether it was daylight savings time or not...we just change the clock so that its stays light out later in the evening instead of being light out earlier in the morning.  Whether we used daylight savings time or not, the amount of sunlight coming during the hottest part of the day would not change either, so the simple fact of daylight savings time or not would not affect your lawn in any way.|`|zvnNHvNwaa	yes it will since there is more sunlight out and it help out the grass|`|za7pJkNNaa	Probably not.  But extreme heat will depending on where you live.|`|c99aa0d7f7f9c98be09c0cdfc426b916aa	Yes, IF you don't go buy some Grass Sunblock...|`|XxnOIOaxaa	Good one!

Why can't people just change what times businesses and whatnot open or any other time dependent activity. So a boss thinks it's too early to be working because it's so dark. Big deal.

AA10541300	Papercut, <br>     It's very good.  I would say that it's better than almost all other pre-ground coffee, aside from Millstone brand.   It's better than some whole bean, including starbucks.  <br>  <br>     The reason why is because it's not as bitter as most.  It's got a very mellow richness that just tastes delicious, like you hope it will when you smell it.  Most coffees fall short of this. <br>  <br>     However, it's not better than roasting it yourself then grinding it.  This is where I get coffee supplies for the best tasting coffee ever. <br>  <a href="http://www.sweetmarias.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sweetmarias.com/</a><br>  <br>    It's a pain to keep up with the amount I'd need to make it for work, so I get a large bag of dunkin donuts coffee for the pot at work.<br>  <br>  -Kevin|`|kkO87h0Xaa	They don't put enough sugar, for my taste.

I think American Dad is a better show because it actually sticks to the story and doesn't drag to random moments. Maybe Seth did run out of ideas for Family Guy and is still making it for the fans and maybe he has more ideas for American Dad.|`|vuBtF8FDaa	its always been horrible<br>  that is why i have never watched it|`|SpTVVeRhaa	its you|`|894aXFYUaa	yes i agree it is not as good anymore<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|d8C5qtS5aa	American Dad is made by the same people who make Family Guy....

N4Hktfmnaa	Let's see...*scrolls through episode list*<br>  <br>  Well there is episode 6, where we see that Kenshin cares about Kaoru. Not "love" care, but "I have to rescue Kaoru even though I might get killed" care. It was rather sweet. The ensuing fight was awesome, though.<br>  <br>  Then we don't really see evidence of the Kenshin/Kaoru relationship waaaaay until about episode 30.

E8ctvIr3aa	No, I'm sure he'll be a great president..<br>  cleaning up bush's mess :D|`|wI5bhnuBaa	Yes, I think he has already made some poor choices including where and how much with certain programs he's putting money "into the economy".  Futhermore, I have conservative ideas and he is a quite radical liberal, so I'm going to disagree with him on almost everything by nature.  I think race has very little to do with it for most people, if he was a moderate conservative I would like him much better.  As long as he doesn't outlaw guns, I want get intensely upset with him.  "Better than Bush", not at all.  Bush wasn't popular but that doesn't make him a bad President.  Almost everyone wanted us to go to Iraq as a result of 9/11, and it only makes sense to do the job right (stay until we're done).  Bush is man enough to do what he believes in, not what everyone wants him to do.<br>  Petersaywhaa you couldn't be more wrong.  Everybody pushes race on everything so much it's stupid.  I have more black friends than white and I don't like Obama as a President (although he is a very successful and courageous man nonetheless, which I think many people would agree even if they didn't vote for him).<br>  The economy is not Bush's fault at all.  You have to be really unintelligent to believe that.|`|wQz9qybgaa	I dont think hes going to be horrible and my judging him has nothing to do with the fact that he is black or muslim. I just dont know about him because during his entire campaign he promised to bring troops home, but now he has just relocated them. I dont understand politics and I wont pretend too, so this may be a good thing and it may not be but the fact that one of his campaign promises was to bring troops home and he didnt might be a foreshadowing of what is too come, but by no means do i think the world will end,<br>  <br>  <br>  only time will tell if he is going to be a horrible president, but in no way am i hoping he will be and quite frankly i think Rush Limba or however you spell it should get kicked in the face for saying he hopes as a country we crash in burn. it shows he is a racist piece of crap and who is he to say anything?<br>  <br>  <br>  i hope obama does great and the military thing is not a foreshadowing. right now we really need a president to pull through for us|`|skvzwS8Faa	No one man can change the world, that's for sure. It's not Bush's fault for the crap we're in now anyways, it's dumb people who buy things that they don't have the money for in the first place. It's America who has to come together and make things happen. We are the ones who have to change in order for America to change. So to answer your question, good or bad, it doesn't matter if America isn't willing to change their ways.|`|uVX0crKQaa	What a non-question.  People ask if the country is ready for Obama just because he is not white and because he has a different religious background that previous presidents.  When Bush Jr. was elected did anyone ask if the country is ready for an idiot president.  <br>  People need to stop judging people on thing that they have no control over.  <br>  <br>  <br>  IRS|`|EUdCd3Uxaa	well im still waiting for the spread of the wealth<br>  more like sell our guns for cheap gas<br>  even if he is better than bush he will never be honest like old bill clinton. he messed up when he turned his back on his church ya dont go to a church and just cause the pastor has a vision get mad and stop going<br>  myself i hope its a short 4yrs i think like who needs a leader when every1 is running their own race like ya know who the 1st country he visted it was mexico i mean lets stand beside israel if ya ask me if not read ur bible u might just find it where the nation who will rule the world will be the sickle and hammer either ussr or china so i hope he changes his mind next time he wants to change i hope its for the israel not some taliban scum thats what that a-bomb is for i could go on and on but i have said enough|`|Q7st7Uasaa	Yeah, and it's because he is a bad president. Not because he's black, and father was a muslim. Your trying to hard, try thinking of prancing ponies in candyland.|`|iz7iVS5Baa	It has nothing to do with the fact that he's black or that his dad is muslim. Quit using those as excuses. Am I too optimistic for him? No. But hey, I hope I'll be wrong just as much as you do.|`|ND1nFEWSaa	IF You knew EVERYTHING about him you may agree he was sponsored into the white house from 25 years ago for the future destruction of America, <br>  <br>  Like an inside job|`|Uq9qPZ75aa	war is at hand.|`|2LOa12xEaa	He already IS a horrible president.|`|4VdvTkilaa	I think he is a great president!! finally someone young and because he is much younger than those others grandpas I think he will make a change for BETTER!!!!|`|yvugbHpRaa	I think he's going to suck as president.<br>  He's all about change, but he has the same people on his cabinet as Clinton. Um...?|`|v0m9j4GCaa	yes|`|hprR6qfHaa	yes hes going to be a horrible president. he is just another corporate pawn.|`|03cd64db97799ad453f75f436a0f4b73aa	i think alot of people are going to resent him before things get better.. I believe it will get worse and then sooo much better.. but i think he will take a big hit from the american people|`|FPX6AcjFaa	PLEAAAASE! NEVER!!<br>  <br>  Plus, I think the line to beat Bush as worst president is preeeetty up there...|`|3uUAjjAQaa	democrat <republican|`|IgIlAiO5aa	going to be...umm he already is...|`|bCkw8E8faa	hes a loser socialist...|`|DS33Wl4waa	No, no one could do as bad as Bush|`|nVh0Ut5Gaa	No, he won't be. He'll do just fine.|`|9YwCx4dwaa	no|`|Ch9TedMcaa	Considering the alternative and what we've had the last 8 years, not in the least.|`|NEtVRjplaa	Yes I do. I can be wrong.. but it doesn't look good from my perspective.|`|VLlyZKYYaa	Umm, there are plenty of people that dislike him and it has nothing to do with the fact that he is black and a muslim.|`|9iNCQkWlaa	Nope i don't think he's horrible...i think he's just another cadillac-socialist...looking to spend other people's money every and any which way he can|`|mnintsvUaa	Not at all.<br>  I'm glad it wasn't Hillary.|`|hNa5oHxQaa	Not at all.<br>  I think he will turn our country around.|`|6pUzzsuhaa	first off he is NOT the first black president- he is part white too! so he's NOT our first black president, he's our first MIXED president<br>  <br>  also, i do not like where he stands religiously. and what he's for and against- i'm almost the opposite of him, ALMOST<br>  <br>  i honestly think that he wont do that good of a job- and people say that we need to put the race factor up, i have, why can't you? this election was all about race weather people want to admit or not. i've gotten past it, now its time for the rest of yall to get past it too<br>  fyi- it's NOT because he is HALF black and that his DAD is muslim.. his dad should have NOTHING to do with what's going on... after all, his dad isn't the president is he? nope!|`|D4eFh7Qlaa	i do not because he's black but because of the things he's doing in the white house with the taxes and ****. and for a gift he gave the prime minister guy 25 american dvds while the prime minister from england gave him some historical expensive sht what a waste.|`|nooi0ldjaa	i don't know. its to early to judge.<br>  <br>  but im really tierd of hearing people say "your only saying that because he's black!" who cares? its the 21st century <br>  GROW UP EVERYONE. everyone wants race to be a<br>  thing of the past, but no one well let it go.<br>  <br>  who cares what coloer he is? all i care about is he does his job, and he does it good. that's it.|`|gjAZeRyfaa	Yes, sorry<br>  Not because of his race, his lack of Biblical morality is<br>  his downfall, imo|`|RIZpDdNgaa	Who the frig knows people are just racist idiots, as long as he revives the economy who cares.|`|apUkTo3maa	NO ONE CAN DO WHAT BUSH DID. MESSED UP EVERYTHING. HE WILL BE A GREAT PRESIDENT.|`|qRKOWgS0aa	Not really|`|6TmJKvleaa	no he will probably be better..he alwayz trys his best|`|dwu1b36xaa	Well actually he probably will just like every other president we have had<br>  first everybody loves the president and as their run drags on people dont like the changes they make blah blah blah<br>  <br>  so he might be he might not<br>  but most presidents end up not being liked after awhile...<br>  Its not about black or white its about how he does things<br>  Lets just hope he does good or we are gonna be screwed.|`|lGdzb8aqaa	considering what he was left with from Bush I don't think he will be any worse then any one else and black has nothing to do with it, I hope for the sake of the country and the economy he does well.|`|APjnSYKuaa	He's already done better things in 2 months than Bush did in 8 years. Of course, most of it is just trying to fix what Bush let get messed up, or what he actually took steps to mess up.|`|w1IF79vJaa	no. not any worse than the last president. its not like the man is running the country alone. he's got a vice president and advisors etc.|`|AA10481071	I don't think people are judging him because he is black or muslim,  I think people are judging him because of his background,  they discovered that he is into some weird way of thinking.|`|4DK8Zk6Maa	well, we all know he's gonna be better than bush. XD.  <br>  <br>  but yeah, America believes in Obama-otherwise McCain would be in the white house right now.  ;)|`|2MZZ7Wtwaa	Its not because he is black, it is because he is IGNORANT!!|`|IqhD4JCCaa	of course he black,black people always stab you in the back at the end|`|Hek7MUNYaa	no he is going to be great as a president<br>  <br>  GO OBAMA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|TifUsG4Maa	No,he,ll do alright...At least he,s not an idiot like the one before him>|`|e0b72c5a543a2ac83d3bd8c89c44146aaa	no just the usa is going to end with him in office|`|cjdPh4Cuaa	Well in four years his record will speak for itself!!!|`|jeZmqhNcaa	No I think he'll do a lot better than Bush|`|Co9I2OMSaa	no i think he'll do great, a lot better than bush every could have done, and did|`|DbQKHNYsaa	No. I just hope he will be better than Bush.|`|NSWO27KSaa	yes it is and his mom was white dont forget that you left winger

Plus it won't even affect the Iris, where the colored section is. And even if you could get to the Iris without blinding yourself, people who have blue eyes have it as a result of loss of pigment in their Iris, less color, so you would have to take out the brown part of your eyes, it's impossible! The only way is to get colored contacts but they are very expensive and unnecessary if you have good eye sight.|`|XdgkK76iaa	No way! You are born with brown eyes and your eyes will stay that way no matter what you do. It's part of your body. Be proud of your eyes! It's just the way your body is. Or just get colored contacts.

gJoVBtnqaa	nuthin but a g thang, a classic
HxfLix4xaa	Seriously..There is not one movie that can come to my mind that can match this one. It was an epic, the storyline is simply subline, the ending is vintage Bollywood. It really is the best movie I have ever seen, it has it all, it's an entertainment package you'll never forget. It's simply mindblowing, I'm just bankrupt for words, this movie can not be given justice by describing it by words. You feel part of this movie, it's like a link that no other movie has ever created, it's simple amazing..The movie has it all - The best soundtrack you can get, the best actors, the best director and the best storyline..<br>  <br>  Really, if you haven't watch this movie you must give it a watch. 99% of people who watch this will love it, but 1% will hate it hard, so bear in mind that it might not be for everyone.<br>  <br>  This was by far the best movie I have ever watched..<br>  <br>  JAI HO!|`|K6AWbAdaaa	This Movie is one of the greatest movies i have ever seen!! I first heard of it on Ellen. Dev Patel was on there promoting the movie and at first i was a little interested. Before the oscars i saw the movie...OMG! i was so happy that they won 8 oscars. i have the soundtrack because Jai ho, the song with the dancing at the end, was stuck in my head. I LOVE THIS MOVIE. EVERYONE SHOULD SEE IT!|`|XGCHYkwFaa	very impressive at first i didn't want to watch it but after five minutes i was stuck like glue i thought it was quite unique|`|q71osfkiaa	Cheap. Just another day in India and it gets worse.<br>  <br>  If one of you want to win an oscar, you should just make documentary title: Slumdog: Decadence
A5FjN63Uaa	oK, to lay it out on the line:<br>  <br>  Michael Jackson until 1993 = Highly Influential<br>  <br>  Michael Jackson after 1993 = Tarnished Career<br>  <br>  I like his 70s stuff and songs from when I grew up (early 80s kid; 90s teen) & his super bowl performance from the early 90s.  After that, he creeped me out.  He's like that old guy that shakes your hand in a touchy-feely way where u don't know if he's a pedo or just shaky.|`|OjS2wJZWaa	Yes, I like his music and him...<br>  <br>  :)|`|9iNCQkWlaa	don't know the man personally|`|BBVfRheyaa	Once.<br>  <br>  Ugly surgery.|`|fC5X8swbaa	I love Thriller.

He's a musical genius.|`|Co9I2OMSaa	i don't like him personally, i hate his guts for what he's done, but some of his music is okay|`|xwEEfzY7aa	Nope, he's a child molester................|`|HQ1t2ayLaa	Michael is cool.|`|a8878aa5ea57903ab8121a0f2f95b0ceaa	Yeah|`|mlI5wPuTaa	no he's gay|`|y2t3F690aa	No<br>  because hes so......"wierd" now and he went TOO far and lost it when he bleached his skin O_o<br>  <br>  i like some of his old songs tho<br>  :]|`|J30Gh5O6aa	no hes a fricken perv.|`|fPsM1PUqaa	hes kool. he had to make him self ugly to shake the ladies  off em!<br>  <br>  his music is classic and always will be.|`|mvB53OvDaa	HES AN AMERICAN ICON!!

TifUsG4Maa	No way,this is 2009 not 1909.|`|v0FlUan0aa	no, a girl should ask too. you shouldnt depend on a boy to ask you out. what if a guy never asks you out, then you'll be single your whole life! you should step up to the plate, maybe asking will change your life :D|`|hFVPEkWjaa	yeah|`|Po4Lljjwaa	No, I don't think they SHOULD.  It's nice when they do, but some girls will be waiting around forever.  Some guys are shy, you know?  Or nervous.  Or they don't know how you feel about them...|`|ybwqYZ1waa	Mostly..... but 83% of the time the girl has to either ask him out or blow her secret crushing on him before he asks her out.|`|FvBj6bWwaa	no. if a girl likes someone they should go for it.|`|De8z6qH4aa	Yeah, it's weird the other way around.|`|ozmqdlEbaa	no way!<br>  a guy can be shyer than a girl<br>  and some appreciate the courage it takes for a girl to ask a guy out.|`|d4c9a4d52a9e77de4545721ac937c02faa	Yea i think they should, i think its fine for girls to ask out a guy, but i'd never do it|`|vPvRZBqGaa	I would rather they did but I don't have a problem with a girl asking a guy out if he doesn't have the guts.|`|Co9I2OMSaa	no.  i think that if a girl is interested, she should ask- the worst he can say is no.|`|y3qClcDyaa	yes|`|Xi6KGBG0aa	no, it'd be way easier|`|sMEni2Tdaa	Yeah.<br>  It's awkward the other way around .. but that's what my bff is doing. -_^<br>  The boy's too shy! >_<|`|NQq8i7gsaa	though its though to be traditional for he boy to ask put the girl, i don't think it really matters, a lot of times boys might be too shy to ask girls out and if a girl asked them out it would be a great relief, but if the girl is shy then its best for the boy to ask|`|ZGVZI3CBaa	I think it's perfectly acceptable either way. I asked my boyfriend out, and we have been very happily together for a year and two months. :)|`|48lxS4pPaa	no.. it is actually the woman's realm in this gender role confused era.  men are much more intimidated by women than women by men opposed to the days of our grandparents.|`|EUdCd3Uxaa	naw its a see-saw thing who ever thinks 1st wins the others ears and maybe heart|`|uGz7V9Zxaa	not really...sometimes guys like me need a push from the girl's side...ive been hurt so much in the past that ive lost confidence, if a girl asks me out is just the only way it can happen|`|dHYVE076aa	Defiantly not.|`|9087a58147211503cc7673b4ad6b1f4baa	No, it can definitely go either way.|`|9Pyx97uBaa	Not always.  I think it's endearing when a girl very shyly asks ME out.  :)|`|AA11367091	Not really.|`|zYXObP1Daa	Yes!|`|v0m9j4GCaa	yes

Then me and the victim (Billfred) would open the door and use hand to hand combat to disarm and subdue the second kidnapper.<br>  <br>  then In a fit of excitement me and one armed transvestite Billfred would jog down to the local for a pint of Guinness|`|upF3zojpaa	well i'd try and befriend the kidnappers. i always used to think someone would take me while i was waiting for my mom to come out of the gas station when i was little! lol now it just seems silly but i never let my guard down<br>  <br>  anyway, i'd sip on the water while asking the kidnapper where he got the doll. then i'd comment of how creepy it was and me and the other victim would tie the doll to the chair and beat it with the plywood! 8)<br>  <br>  then i'd ask the guy to get me some lighter fluid to douse the doll with after he thinks we're friends and squirt it him the eyes so he couldn't see then drive away on a forklift and have the other guy i was with throw explosive barrels out of the rear end while i drove it down the street til the bad buys die. then i'd go home and take a nap after having to come up with such a foolproof escape plan!|`|w6tQEuKCaa	I WOULD..seduce them by doing sexual things to the other victim..then id.then poor some water on my body.letting some drip on the floor in the process{in case he tried to get up..hed slip}..then id tell them to lay down..id have the other victim grab the ply wood while im riding them and bust them upside the head..then we'd tie him up to a chair and sit the doll in his lap..=-)|`|VArX90LKaa	i would smash the first kidnapper with the chair and then choke the other one and choke the one i hit with the chair put the plywood near a window Take Other other person and jump out the window,use the water to drink eat the doll if i have to|`|Drze0cUXaa	i would leave as much evidence as possible to trace police to me. I might knock the kidnapper upside the head with the ply wood and tie them up with the rope. Then I would run to the police and get their crazy *** in jail.|`|AAeK9EXaaa	pick the freakin chair up and get the other victim to get the ply wood and go after them with it. if that didnt work i would convince them that the doll was chuckie and tell them it was going to kill them if they didnt let us go!lol|`|X3QBqLSHaa	I would knock out the guys with the bottle (or the wood), tie them to a chair, and throw the doll at the door until it opened! haha|`|9fAHd15Caa	strangle him with the rope, with the help of the other victim, then kill him with the chair.. im weak so rly id prolly end up dead|`|TifUsG4Maa	Name rank and serial number....I,d choke one kidnapper with the rope.Then i,d lure the other one in with the creepy doll and hit him in the head with the chair.|`|0L5wlQlJaa	Me and victim arm ourselves with ply wood and chai, knock kidnappers @$$es out, tie em up and leave|`|qPb05tfQaa	ok, so you know how there's always the skinny bad guy and the fat bad guy? well the fat one would throw me into the storage space and there would be no light. i hate the dark, so i would start to cry. Then there would be this movement in the corner and a really hot guy my age would come into view in the light of the itty bitty window. He would be holding a bottle creepy doll. "Thank god!" he would say. "I have been waiting for some other victim to be thrown in here! Now i can put my plan to action." He would walk over to the other side of the room and disappear into the DARKNESS! he comes back with a chair in hand. He climbs up on to it then grabs my hand and pulls me onto his shoulders. "Hey, can you get that piece of ply wood?" It is on the dresser next to me. "Good, now could you slide it under the trap door there?" i do. It takes a little heaving and hawing, but eventually the door opens with a bang. We hold our breath, waiting for somebody to hear and come charging in. When there is no charging, he lets me down off of his shoulders and gets some provisions. He gets a creepy doll, a rope, and some water. we get back onto the chair in the same positions, and he hands me the rope which i proceed to tie onto a hook outside. We climb out using the rope. Once through the trap door, we see the two villains coming toward us. the boy takes out the creepy doll and starts punching it. Turns out, it was a voooooodoooooo dolllllllllllllll!!!!!! The skinny one keels over and lays on the ground. then the other comes towards us, but I quickly grab the rope and tie a hang man's noose. yeah, i'm good with knots. I throw it around his fatty neck and pull with all my might. Now that they are both down for the count, we race away and call the police. <br>  <br>  The end :D|`|jMRGnNjYaa	i would throw all that stuff at the kidnappers and run... then call the police to help the other guy|`|1RzQ3lK8aa	Certainly not come across Stockholm syndrome.

They would come in, slip or at least become distracted with the water, and we would hit the crap out of them. Then, while they're either hurt or unconscious, I would disarm them, and tie them up to the chair, with the creepy doll staring at them. Then I'd take whatever is left of the water and run.|`|CsEXxIC0aa	1. i throw the water over my pants to say i had an accident to go to the bathroom<br>  2. then i would use the plank of wood to rest of the toilet flush button so the kidnapper thinks i am still in the toilet.<br>  3. then i would escape through the door throwing the chair at the kidnappershead but that wouldnt work then iwould lasso the kidnapper; and throw the other victi on top of him :D|`|bRE26RDvaa	. two 2-lit bottle of water<br>  . a chair<br>  . a creepy doll<br>  . a rope<br>  . some ply wood <br>  . another victim<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  whenever the kidnappers were out of the room I would quietly plan out our escape to the other victim I would instruct to develop "Stockolm syndrome" (in which the victim attempts to speak to the kidnapper in a friendly human way) because many people have saved their lives by symphatizing with their captors, and this way the kidnapper will see you more like a person, not an object.<br>  act positive, DO NOT antagonize my captors, do what I am  told. <br>  always keep a relaxing image in my head like what I want to do when I get home. <br>  I would try to seek improvements in my envirement especially if I was being held there for more than one day. <br>   <br>  we would drink the water to survive. <br>  <br>   I would wait at the side of the door that they usually come in and knock the captors out with the plywood, me and the other victim would flee and there we would find a truck and I would hot wire it and drive it to the nearest town, and there I would call the police and give all the descriptions.|`|AAy127sqaa	show them the creepy doll then hit them with the chair, bang them over the head with ply wood and tie a rope around their neck and make them beg for their life, then grab my n95 and call the cops!<br>  <br>  oh and water..  uh pour it on their face when they're head is tied around the rope, a bit of torture for kid napping me. not to much, im a nice person<br>  <br>  i would also save some water for me and my victim to drink until the cops come<br>  <br>  i would kick them when they are tied up too.  and knee them in the face, give them a black eye, things of that nature.<br>  <br>  Also for the others answer if anyone is smart enough to plan a kidnapping and its a guy, they should have groin pads! seriously!<br>  <br>  :P<br>  <br>  and poo and pee in the empty bottle until the cops come.<br>  <br>  my n95 has GPS as well!<br>  <br>  and i not carrying my swiss army knife with me, right?|`|SrRsoLfmaa	First I would scoot over to the other victim and help each other on tie each other if we were tied up.<br>   I would take the rope/ply wood/water/chair with us<br>  <br>  leaving the creepy doll under stuff or some thing to look like us there<br>  <br>  Find a window or door and use the chair if we need to get out a high window =D <br>  <br>   Then try to find help, but run for a while Were the water would come in handy.<br>   ust in case our kidnapper was close and or anyone involved in it.<br>  <br>  Then get to help and we be free =DD|`|j5l2Nbsuaa	I would:<br>  1st.

So, if the recessive genes were to combine together (and yes there is a possibility of this; it is most apparent when an offspring looks more like an aunt or uncle then the parents, because the genes are still there just not dominant) they could lead to a human child.<br>  <br>  Sabertooth is part human, otherwise he wouldn't look human, same for Mystique and the son of Sabertooth. The genes are still there. The genes in Sabertooth (and hence his child) along with Mistique mutated, but more than likely only the dominant genes, not also the recessive.<br>  <br>  I hope this makes sense to you! =)

He did marry Lois, and Jimmy Olsen still knows, as always.<br>  <br>  But honestly...I think a lot of it is just that folks didn't figure it out for the same reasons that folks in *our world* didn't figure out that, for example, that G.W. Bush was an imbecile, or that our economy was in bad shape, for the past eight years.<br>  <br>  We get busy dealing with our own lives, and then stupid things happen, and instead of just admitting that it happened on our watch, we go into denial and say it's "someone else's problem".  And well, you know, even in *our* world, reporters and journalists are busy people who live and die by the deadline.  Nobody really has time to be nosy or introspective about their mistakes in that line of work.<br>  <br>  So it's human nature, exaggerated into a plot device for a fictional setting.  Nobody tries to imagine Clark with a spitcurl or Supes with glasses for the same sorts of reasons that nobody "remembered" that Buffy killed "vampires" in another fictional realm.  It just takes too much time and effort to break through the denial and wrap one's head around the truth.<br>  <br>  But hey, what do I know?

These services automatically re-size (or reduce it). So, the best you can do is re-size your image and re-upload it, but the end result is still going to be relatively small compared to the original size.<br>  <br>  1) Microsoft Paint is on most Windows computers with Microsoft software in the Accessories programs section. You can use a different photo-editing software if you like.<br>  - Open Paint, then open the image file from within Paint.<br>  - Click on the Image Menu and choose "Attributes."<br>  - Increase the pixel width and length OR use "stretch and skew" to increase the dimension (length and width) percentage. Try to increase by the same amount for each dimension.<br>  - Click on the Image Menu and choose Flip/Rotate. Choose an option in the pop-up window and click the OK button.<br>  - Go to the File menu and Save As. Make sure to save the image as a different file name.<br>  <br>  Then, re-upload the image to the personal profile pic module in your 360 space (<a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> ). Click the "use as primary" option next to the image, if you have more than one image in that module, before saving. You'll have to wait for the Y/A system to register the change.<br>  <br>  This is likely a trial and error process though. Try making the image maybe 3 times its current size and see what happens. Aim for a mid-sized image at first (200-400 pixels per dimension). Some people make the height dimension much longer than the width to get a "stretched" look.

JgCGpQaxaa	I think it's because there is SOOOO much anime.  Heck 30-50 new anime are coming out every 6 months.  <br>  <br>  And honestly, anything that's not ongoing now in Japan can be classified as "old" because a large portion of the people who watched it and discussed it did so as it was coming out epiode by episode.  Hence, the discussion largely ends after it is finished airing, as people have already moved on to the next 50 anime.<br>  <br>  There are two exceptions to that:<br>  1.  Long running anime.  Since they span multiple mutiple seasons people can continue to talk about them for longer periods of times.<br>  <br>  2.  Anime that aired on US Cable.  If it has done his, it has gotten a much huger audience then any other anime could possible get (for us English audiences).  Hence the increase in discussion.<br>  <br>  And sadly, Naruto, Bleach, etc... fall under BOTH of these categories.|`|hSpsroCXaa	Personally from your list i've seen.<br>  <br>  Grave of the Fireflies - Thought it was great<br>  Azumanga Daioh - Thought it was ok<br>  5 centimeters per second - thought it was good.<br>  <br>  But still i would put One Piece close to the top of my favorite anime really because im watching the storyline not the how its animated or the artwork, which puts alot of people off.<br>  <br>  And Bleach is close to the top of my Favorite manga, because i think they have ruined the anime beyond repair.<br>  <br>  Although i disagree on how scarce you seem to think Grave of the Fireflies is in answers, it comes up quite alot.<br>  <br>  Back to the question though. Yeah i do think its because the majority of people who answer here are under 14 or they are just beginning to watch anime. And i also think the reason anime like that are answered most often is because thats what people seem to want to hear.<br>  <br>  If theres a question like "What anime is like naruto" you can't exactly answer FLCL because its nothing like naruto and again with things like that people see 6 episodes and think "what can go on in 6 eps ?"<br>  <br>  Also remember alot of these people are kids, that dont want to see things that will make them think about hardships and cruel truths of war they just want something fun and exciting to watch.<br>  <br>  I just craft my answer depending on how the question has been asked, usualy i can tell roughly what they would want to see by how they ask the question.<br>  <br>  The way i ended up watching proper anime (yeah i started on naruto and bleach aswell) was, everytime that i saw the name of an anime i had never saw in someones answer, i would search it on wikipedia and then bookmark it and just work my way down the list.|`|bZsF1n0zaa	I did watch Grave of the Fireflies. It was good!<br>  <br>  The others I haven't heard of yet, but I'll see if I can check them out.<br>  <br>  What do you mean the same crap over and over? If you mean Naruto, then yes that is Crap lol<br>  <br>  If they get overlooked is probably because they just aren't as great as the other anime we mostly hear about:<br>  <br>  - Bleach<br>  - Death Note<br>  - Code Geass<br>  - Elfen Lied-<br>  - One Piece<br>  - FMA<br>  - etc etc etc<br>  <br>  These are just far better, so that's why we hear of them more.<br>  <br>  I'm sure the ones you listed are good, but maybe not good enough to be as popular as the regular anime we hear about.<br>  <br>  But thanks for mentioning these to me, let me see if I like them!<br>  ~~(^__^)~~|`|7c78402fd1142e6ed4496774eb33431baa	I've seen Grave of the Fireflies and 5 Centimeters per Second along with a string of Studio Ghibli films. I think they are so moving, at times I do cry. My first ever anime I've watched was Fushigi Yuugi (even though it was old, I watched it in 2007) - that was very emotional too. I haven't seen Bleach or Naruto, and I don't intend to either. <br>  <br>  Current popular animes disregard the realism of japan's/world's nature these days.|`|thyMAgFBaa	i think people tend to go for the things that have been dubbed in english recently, whether they are watching the anime subbed or dubbed or whatever, because its easiest to find.<br>  <br>  oh and add "i my me strawberry eggs" , "Clannad" ,  "sketchbook fullcolerS" , and "keroro gunso" to your list of animes you dont hear about alot. they're really good :)|`|bQgrMXEBaa	i dont kno, but ive read 2 of the series u posted. i really liked Aishiteruze Baby, but i wasnt the biggest fan of Azumanga daioh(tho it was kinda funny) lol, "roll with the punches." car accidents. good times|`|MX0s76pzaa	Some people just watch what they hear of/mainstream stuff and they don't go past that point. I bet there are way better animes out there that no one even heard of.|`|XoUfUl6Yaa	Most of the users who frequent this section are quite obviously under 13 years old(or just past it). I wouldn't assume, in their short years of life, that most have heard of those titles. I constantly recommend anime titles for questions that ask for it only to be overlooked myself. It seems the children of today only like anything published in "Shonen Jump!".<br>  <br>  [edit] A Vietnam veteran!? Damn, gramps, my father is a Vietnam vet. 25th Infantry division. You?|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Well, its because people have different tastes than you. They like something other than what you choose for them.<br>  <br>  Those series are great though.<br>  <br>  Only fans who first see Bleach and Naruto are just kids or new born fans. They don't like old school stuff.|`|gvOi9h60aa	ive honestly never heard of any single anime mentioned above maybe its just before my time but they sound pretty old<br>  <br>  <br>  and im 18 not under 13 i guess the fact that i like to read manga alot more than watch anime doesnt help though|`|cidwIuJRaa	Actually,when Ghibli/Miyazaki Qs come up,*Grave of the Fireflies* is mentioned quite a bit,as it was a very touching film in both anime & live forms.<br>  <br>  *Ai Baby* and *Azumanga* are also cool animes as well.And,I have never seen *5cm per Second*.<br>  <br>  <br>  Reason we keep seeing the same old BS repeatedly on this board is b/c no1 seems to look past things like *Naruto*,*Bleach*,and *Code Geass* to watch any animes that are actually touching in any way.|`|AA12397801	Most people start out watching the newer animes that are shown on tv. For example Naruto that's shown in cartoon network and Code Geass, Bleach, Death Note, Full Metal Alchemist that are shown in adult swim. Since that's how most anime viewers begin thats pretty much all they can reccomend. Usually later on they get into the more classics. Like me for example my anime days began when I first took a liking in Sailor Moon when it premired on Cartoon Network a few years back. But now I like to look up different anime no matter how old they are. Like: Rouruni Kenshin for example. Really good and a classic. But I have actully heard of 5 cm per sec. and Grave of Fireflies. I think they get over looked because most people stay focused on watching the newer and more common anime.|`|olLnjC7Gaa	i know of two of the animes u talked about and i give 5 stars for both of them.<br>  <br>  I dont know why some people don't like it but i like them both ^_^<br>  <br>  Grave of the Fireflies *one of the best*<br>  5 centimeters per Second *it is great*|`|xFrIGJEsaa	I really don't know. Some people just aren't interested in anything other than the mainstream stuff, or maybe they haven't thought to look deeper than that yet. They stick to what they know and seem to only care about what series are popular.<br>  <br>  You can add Mushishi, Monster, Kino's Journey, and Denno Coil to that list as well~<br>   <br>  I personally haven't seen Aishiteruze Baby or Azumanga, I've heard good things about about Azu, but Grave of the Fireflies and 5 Centimeters per Second are great.<br>  <br>  Edit: I do my best to try and mention the lesser known series as often as possible, in the hopes that the people asking the questions actually become interested in them
JgCGpQaxaa	Let's stay on the vain of Azumanga Daioh...<br>  <br>  How about when Osaka wanted to wake up Yukari with a frying pan- but in her half dazed stupor she accidentaly grabs a knife instead, and terrorfies Yukari.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Also, I'm loveing the Azumanga Daioh attention you are giving.

f2b1a09b580fe9049bc28c8e845abd3aaa	One time someone asked what I probably consider the one of the funniest question on here, it was "will I loose weight if I poop more?" and the thing that made it even more funny is that the person was dead serious.|`|2jMFurDoaa	how about just today i answered "what kind of steroid is good for a beginner?"<br>  <br>  ????????????????????????|`|tIoeOgJ4aa	how many times a day do you go to the bathroom.|`|mSt1LGfjaa	someone asked<br>  has your skirt fall off???<br>  what size is your kitty liiter box...??
aDXW1tMqaa	i have known several people over the years who have done it...from the age of 14 to 19-most of which, cut themselves. i dont do it personally cuz i know if i get started then it will become a habit that i wish i wouldnt have started.... and yeah, most of the people i know who have done it or do, are the typical angry teen who sits in their room and listens to metal and talks about how much they hate their parents, but they dont really have anything else to take their anger/sadness/whatever else emotion out on, im guessing... i dont really talk about it with them cuz most of them are going through bad stuff. i dont judge them on it though, its their thing, ya know?.....<br>  <br>   i mean, if you think about it everything is self injury, drugs, drinking,eating too much, i mean, shi*, sitting out in the sun too long is freakin self injury..... people are hurting themselves doing all kinds of things, so who am i to judge someone who chooses to do it in a different way...atleast thats the way i look at it.|`|tBJnxEjGaa	Mixed opinion ! Hard subject ! I have never done it ! But I do personally know of one person that I am very close to and care for more than life itself  - who does it ! It is disturbing - yet I can understand the reasoning behind it ! I watched the movie called "America" on Lifetime Network on TV. The way that Rosie O' Donald said it - made me understand it a lil better. I think most do it to them self when they get so stressed out - so they don't take it out on anyone else. Many think it is a trend or to fit in, or a cry for attention --- but not so in all cases ! It can be a sickness - like depression, alcoholism, drugs, etc. It is sad that people's sadness and stress gets so bad that this is the only thing they can resort to - to help ease the pain within them ! And for those out there who thinks counseling and meds is the answer -- I can assure you - it is the not ! I have suffered from depression all my life ! So no one has the right to bad mouth any mental illness, or cutting, burning, sadness, etc --- until they have had to walk in their shoes ! No picnic !|`|y3qClcDyaa	i've done it when i was 13-14<br>  i did it out of extremely low self-esteem and anger|`|ZjSgawcpaa	It's terrible.|`|M8kNmWuAaa	I did when i was 14.

Let's just leave it at that :/|`|r8s5j6zOaa	yes it wrecks your soul|`|7pJ8S0Liaa	Yes, it makes you feel like dirt.  Like you are not worthy of true love.  Like something must be wrong with you if your man is cheating on you.  It really sucks!<br>  <br>  I was with an abusive man for 11 years.  I would more than likely be with him still if it wasn't for him cheating on me.  I figured if I had to be beat then I wouldnt stick around for cheating too.  I figured if he was going to see others then he could beat them and leave me alone.  <br>  <br>  Being degraded by being beat hurt bad enough.  But I lost my mind when he cheated.  I was not sticking around long enough to end up getting a disease also!|`|jezA7yqtaa	Yes i do.<br>  That one person ruined my whole life!<br>  Now its hard to trust people i date, i think they will do the same. Its the worst feeling ever.

I don't care if people dislike me or not. I am who I am.|`|et9gdoDKaa	Sometimes it hurts my feelings. Sometimes it just makes me want to say "f\ck you" and then I move on.|`|BxkoRONOaa	First of all not everyone is going to like everyone. However, you might be projecting your fears and insecurities onto them which is "Oh they dont like me" when you do not even know if this true.  And the physical confrontation that they want to have with you is only because you are pestering them - that is enough to make any one mad.  What I suggest is stop racking your brains and just talk to people and stop being paranoid because that is what this boils down to.|`|xxS74ZsMaa	not exactly. not everyone is going to like you..no matter what the reason is...that's life and it sucks that people have to be so judgmental,but u cant change them and there not important..don't worry about them..just worry about the people who do like you for who u are and are your friends :)|`|7YuZOErRaa	I don't really care...well I do somewhat. I want to know the reasoning behind it. I don't like people just saying they hate me. I usually just shrug it off, but I am a very nice person and honestly don't have hardly any enemies. I even say hi to the smelly nerds and ghetto trash. :-)<br>  <br>  :P|`|Gy127q6zaa	life is too short to care about people who judge you when you've done nothing wrong. it hurts, but it is important to get over it too.|`|nw8ql9gdaa	umm no theyre this kind called HATERS. they make my world go round.

It was more quirky drama than 'cop show,' but what the heck; the main characters were two cops (Mountie and Chicago policeman.)

Xk5NWhvXaa	The song is called 10 Stories Down and it's by Michelle Featherstone.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I recorded the show and hunted down the final song of the episode myself, without referring to the official MTV list, so I'm certain that the final song of episode 11 was Chelsea Lee. I also just double checked the online version of the episode and the songs matched the tv version, so I'm not sure about the different songs online theory.<br>  <br>  I just re-read the question, and although she asks for the final song of the episode (which is by Chelsea Lee) I see she wanted to know the second last song playing before the scene at Amy's Bread. I have edited my answer.<br>  <br>  MTV doesn't seem to list all the songs that are in the episode, so that may be part of the confusion.|`|YlEZIT7waa	That isn't the song. MTV uses different music for the TV version of the show and the online version. Not sure why, but they do. The music on the MTV website is the music from the TV version.

hSpsroCXaa	I was looking forward to hearing Kids voice since i first saw them in the manga and now that i have heard it i thought i was awesome.<br>  <br>  I agree on Laws voice aswell he sounds alot more sinister than i expected, but with nicknames like "Dark Doctor" and "Surgeon of Death" what can you expect.<br>  <br>  I love the part in the manga where Zorro is about to cut up the World Noble and some of the captians speak about his power and that he is only the first mate <a href="http://www.onemanga.com/One_Piece/499/17/" rel="nofollow">http://www.onemanga.com/One_Piece/499/17...</a><br>  <br>  Thats the part i'm most looking forward too in the next episode.|`|RGWYij5iaa	LAW!<br>  Lol<br>  My favorite!!

There aren't really any "tricks" they do (usually.) You can tell by the tone of his voice. Is it happy? Playful? Excited? If you answer yes to all of those, most likely he is flirting. Obviously, it also depends on what he's saying. So don't just stare into his eyes. You might miss something if you do. Good luck!!

KAPakAh9aa	You have nothing to worry about. At least you weren't doing anything else with the guy. It is just a life lesson for you, we all have them and we all get through them. You won't be known as any kind of "anything" for doing what you did cause all it was, was a harmless make out session. <br>  The other girl obviously has some issues to deal with and needs to just worry about herself. Just let her know about how it makes you feel and tell her to get rid of the footage if it really makes you uncomfortable. Next time just be aware that you may be having too much to drink and that you should probably stop before something like this or worse happens. All in all just take it as a life lesson, and don't do anything harsh to get back at the girl cause it really isn't worth it.|`|w1IF79vJaa	omg. thats horrible. i dont drink, so i wont have that problem. and i only make out with my boyfriend.<br>  <br>  as for you....tell her that you'd like to see what she's been showing everyone. if she shows you...tell her she has to delete it right away, in front of you. if she plays stupid and acts clueless, tell her you know she's been showing the video around--you have sources, and you want her to delete it.<br>  <br>  its messed up that she would do that. let her know it makes you embarrassed and you feel hurt that she would show it around like that.

835ZC2jUaa	All you really need to play is a bass, an amp, and a cable to plug the bass into the amp. As for getting started I would strongly recommend getting some private lessons. They may be expensive but if you are serious they will really pay off in the long run. Also there are a ton of websites that you can look at. When ever I talk to someone who is starting I always tell them to learn where every note is on the fretboard (the fret board is also called the neck). You should work on each hand individually and then put them together. Also so that you don't get burned out you should learn some easy songs that you can play along with. I would recommend the song money by Pink Floyd because it is not that hard but it really sounds cool. You can find where people have made tabs on the internet for just about any song. So really my best advice is to get a teacher and learn the where the notes are.

The rest I either think are OK like My Chemical Romance, or I absolutely hate like The academy is, and red jumpsuit apparatus. But It is a good to like a lot a different bands. PEACE.|`|uGz7V9Zxaa	i would say<br>  <br>  I LOVE YOU!<br>  <br>  my favorite bands are there<br>  <br>  red hot chili peppers<br>  my chemical romance<br>  NIRVANA!!!<br>  blink 182<br>  green day<br>  velvet revolver<br>  korn<br>  etc<br>  etc<br>  etc<br>  <br>  =]<br>  <br>  basically we have the same taste in  music :3

hcqNXUH5aa	I would hope to be insanely great but not great enough where people would recognize me on the street (like J.K. Rowling).  I'd want to remain incognito.  I'm a private person, and if stalked by the paparazzi, I'd actually have to wear make-up and clothes that match "everyday."  And I probably couldn't wear my cheetah-printed or snowman-printed foot-pjs around the house (my front windows don't have blinds). <br>  <br>  I'm picking great for a couple reasons:<br>  1) I value quality over quantity.<br>  2) I'm extremely slow at writing, because I'm very thorough and detail-oriented (so, frankly, I could never be prolific anyway).|`|35JIECGRaa	Insanely great ... I would love to be able to keep a low profile because even if I wasn't great, I wouldn't have the spotlight on me (which I hate).

AA10246871	We've been married so long it's very comfortable. There aren't as many ups and downs as there used to be, but there are still plenty. We fought so much in the first two years I didn't know if we'd make it, and oddly, we haven't fought as much in the last 17 as we did in the first two. We just had our 19th anniversary, but we've been together nearly 20 years. Wow--writing that makes me realize how long it's been. Next year, I will have been married to him for half of my life.<br>  <br>  Being in love is funny. It's ups and downs, and it's hard if you're paying attention and trying to make it work. But it's also very rewarding. It's nice knowing there's always at least one person in your corner, and who has your back no matter what. My husband told me just tonight that the longer we are married, the more protective he feels of me. I am not some nice, quiet, flowery, feminine type of woman, and I certainly don't need someone protecting me, but it's nice nonetheless. I asked him what he'd do if I got into a physical altercation with another woman. He said, "Well, naturally I'd separate you two, but she'd go flying and end up on her a**." I don't like to think about what would happen to a man who messed with me. Men have tried before, and they don't like answering to my husband for it. An older man pushed me rudely once at a store, and when my husband found out, he got right up in the man's face, thumped him on the chest really hard, and said, "You want to push someone? You think you're a big man? Push me." I was seriously worried the guy was going to pass out. So was everyone else around us. It was hilarious, and I would bet he hasn't pushed another woman out of his way since then.<br>  <br>  He's a big man--built like a linebacker, but only almost exactly 6' tall. He thinks he's getting pudgy, but the truth is that when we were young and he was "skinny", he still weighed close to 250 lbs. It took me a long time to find shirts to fit him when we were first married--his shoulders are so broad (a holdover from being a weightlifter when he was younger) that he's muscle bound up there (limited mobility) and requires a really big shirt just to get it over his shoulders. He has big blue eyes, hair which has gone from blond to really light brown with some gray at the temples. Because of his size, and because his face at rest is not inclined to smiling, he is very intimidating to other people. He's actually a big teddy bear, unless someone makes him angry. He's one of those guys who steps into a person's personal space the minute there's a confrontation. It drives him nuts when we argue, because he does that with me, and I just step in closer, so we're nearly touching. Everyone else backs up, but I just get right in his face. He's extremely masculine, and also extremely gentle and kind. He has a wicked sense of humor, a mouth like a sailor, and isn't afraid to speak his mind. And the first thing people learn about him is that I am his queen, and that they shouldn't say anything bad about me. It gets tricky sometimes, because I am half Arab, and people like to spout off about Arabs in general. They get one warning from him. As far as I know, no one has ever had the nerve to say something a second time.<br>  <br>  I'm crazy about him. Oddly, so are most other women. I don't mean oddly because he isn't attractive, because he is, but it's a little stupid because he talks about me all the time, and the only times he's had his wedding band off are when he's had an MRI or had surgery. Women flirt with him all the time, much to my annoyance. I am kind of plain, and sometimes I can see they're thinking, "Well, I am a much better catch then she is, why shouldn't I let him know I am interested?" We just laugh at them because they don't know how it is with us.<br>  <br>  The other thing I really love about him is that babies, little kids, and animals love him the minute they see him. He scares the hell out of adults, but tiny little ones love him. He used to have a "girlfriend" who informed him that when she was old enough, they were going to get married. She was 4 when she first met him, and 5 the last time she saw him. Every time they went in to his work, she was wrapped around one of his legs immediately. She'd bring him cookies and things she made him every time she saw him. Sometimes they went into his work when he wasn't there, and there'd always be something from her waiting for him when he went back to work. Her mom tried explaining that the big gold ring meant he had a wife and was married, "like Mommy and Daddy are." She didn't care, and she told him so. She said to him once, "Maybe your wife will get tired of you and I can have you when I am old enough." <br>  <br>  Well, she's probably about 18 or 19 now, and I am still not tired of him :)|`|8BJQbTRqaa	my boyfriend is really funny, sweet, he's a great singer (we met at one of his shows) and he's super hot. people say he looks like gael garcia<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.starblogs.net/archives/gael.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.starblogs.net/archives/gael.j...</a>|`|TBZK5q78aa	I never been in love, but I been infatuated...

d33ff6b12876ab19368e1b44c245857caa	you know what!?!?! GO FOR IT!!! I think I ended up with EXACTLY the right career for me. Like a lot of schools, mine thought that I should plan out exactly what I should want to do with the rest of my life in the last semester of 8th grade. I JUST COULDN'T DO IT!!! I went through the motions, and ended up doing things my way through school. I was involved in sports, drama, art and the school newspaper. I was friends with all sorts of people and did pretty well with the whole grade thing without trying. I started working at 16 as a lifeguard, and began managing soon after that, Soon people started to see my creative skills, which to me is just a way of figuring things out. Now I am a Recreation Program Coordinator...which basically means that I get to do all the things I love...and PLAY for a living! I plan special events, summer programs for kids and it just gets better and better! I couldn't be happier that being so confused as a teen, turned out so well!|`|4sd4eeBdaa	I'd like to do something in Music<br>  <br>  i dont see it happening at all, too difficult and competitive, funny how most people on this page say they will achieve it but probably never will.|`|47l1Sumeaa	A lawyer.

Rm1zxWQmaa	Arrested Development|`|dMBSE8ilaa	Where do I start?<br>  <br>  Moonlight- brilliant but canceled after 1 season<br>  Journeyman<br>  Bionic Woman (the new one)<br>  ^ Those 3 got canceled because of the writer's strike, after only having 1 season<br>  <br>  Drive<br>  Dark Angel<br>  John Doe<br>  ^ Those shows were on Fox and they got canceled after having only 1 season too.<br>  <br>  There's more, but that's all I'm gonna put for now.|`|kfOpbbCyaa	There were two that came to mind when I saw your question. Then I read what you had written, and both of those made your list:<br>  -American Gothic<br>  -Nowhere Man<br>  <br>  In fact, I am in the process of watching Nowhere Man (rented the DVDs - there are 9 and I'm up to the 8th DVD), and American Gothic is next.<br>  <br>  I do remember seeing reruns of The Nightstalker on TV and thinking that was interesting. Of course, I was a child, so it may not have been as good as it seemed to young eyes.<br>  <br>  It wasn't a regular series, but I wish they'd made more of the Nero Wolfe (with Timothy Hutton as Archie Goodwin) episodes on A&E.|`|QyjUYqfSaa	Just the ten of us<br>  My so-called life|`|iT9S20zvaa	I have three:<br>  - Firefly (one of my favorite television shows of all time; I love the characters)<br>  - Freaks and Geeks (more of a comedy; the things the characters go through are almost painful to watch just because they seem so realistic)<br>  - Wonderfalls (very interesting premise, but, of course, it got pulled) <br>  <br>  <br>  Out of all of these, my absolute favorite was Firefly.  I watched it after it was cancelled because I had liked the movie Serenity.  I think the series had more potential than all the shows I've seen on television in the last five years...Compared to the others I mentioned above, it's the winner for me; hands down.  I was devastated that it was not going to continue.  I loved it that much.  What a shame...|`|zovrJ0yXaa	firefly is probably the best show ever made, let alone the fact it only got 14 episodes. its so textured, witty, smart, insightful, just plain brilliant, i can honestly say i have never watched such a convincing world on tv before. every episode was an absolute gem and every moment was pure gold. after seeing how chubby nathan fillion is now compared to captain tightpants it might be a bit difficult to get another serenity movie, which is a shame.<br>  <br>  arrested development is also a show that had a rough ride but considering it was perfect for its 3 seasons and got to round out its story im less inclined to see it extended beyond its natural lifespan. im still looking forward to the film like crazy, tho.<br>  <br>  also, i'll go with dark angel just because i got to see jessica alba looking absurdly hot every single episode. in leather|`|894aXFYUaa	moonlight<br>  dark angel<br>  they were the ones i missed<br>  <br>  Hope this helps

9ehfz3Gzaa	It depends on the type of clothing you have and yep, the size of boobage makes a big difference!!! If you are wearing a strappy or backless top clearly you can't wear a bra... but it's not a good look on big-busted girls. Some tops provide built-in support which makes a bra redundant. But if you're talking about just generally going braless, like with a t-shirt or something, its never ok! If you can see nipple or sagging, put on a bra!!!!|`|uu6JYenAaa	It was a fasion statement in the 60's but not anymore.  Going braless now looks just plain slutty.|`|WHcBV7rLaa	Women can do whatever they want with their boobs, as long as its covered in public (only because of legalities). I personally like wearing a bra, but it someone else doesn't, she should go for it, regardless of the "size of the boobage"|`|4af7b1e055fcc07f742201869b6bf138aa	I've always thought that the braless look was a good one.

qy07K2k5aa	Yes, I'm a Chinese from Singapore. Chinese, specifically Mandarin, is my Mother Tongue, but my first language is English.|`|7b785af8d1983d840827831f0028c949aa	I can barely speak it, let alone write it.<br>  <br>  Sad thing is, I am Chinese. But I barely had any Chinese classes, since I left Singapore when I was like... 6. Here in the US, I barely used it, so I lost a lot of knowledge. I still can very minimally converse and understand it. My mom's side speaks Cantonese, my dad's side speaks Teochew. My dad just speaks Cantonese with my mom. So I can make out a bit of Cantonese, Teochew and Mandarin.<br>  <br>  I definitely lost my writing skills though.|`|YaN0PtZKaa	Haha, darn i wish you had asked 'can you read chinese' instead, cause that's all i can do really, lol. when i attempt to speak chinese it sounds french somehow, haha.<br>  But yeah i actually took classes for a bit, for fun.|`|Teo9Gc9xaa	i can only write and speak numbers<br>  my mom taught me|`|xZQjK7oKaa	Oui.<br>  <br>  Oops, wrong language!|`|GqUFQmBkaa	Ni Hao|`|1hiImyBdaa	Yes-I can.I learned Mandarin.|`|98yFxXi9aa	Speak - yes<br>  Write - a few

VEqDtXXoaa	Here's the thing...with me, I like all kinds of music. Literally. While I don't mind listening to this song, at this point in time I'd rather listen to something more like the blues. Kind of surprising coming from someone so young, right? Well back in the day (hah!) musicians used to stretch themselves musically. They would try new things with what they were playing, and every song would have some sort of solo in it. So even though I do like this song, I would rather listen to something with a little more musicianship in it. Such as this song: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHrl44t6CeU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHrl44t6C...</a>|`|ns1F0p8Laa	not really I am more into r&b and gospel music|`|kyTBaYFlaa	no|`|mDzOujJQaa	ya NIN kicks @$$|`|wRizCx8Laa	its cool! love nin!!|`|DYttAN4jaa	honestly?

IdkfMcHfaa	Don't worry about the racism in Alabama.  It is a great school.  Racism in the deep south is open.  Where you really have to worry about racism is in the midwest, where I live.  Here everyone is a closet racist, but everyone acts like angels.  Michigan has seven of the top twenty five most racially segregated metropolitan areas.  Down south, you know who is and isn't racist.  Don't be afraid of Alabama.  Go there and be successful.|`|TBZK5q78aa	You don't go to college for fun, you go for education.

IVkGJTcuaa	Do you have the physical ticket or did you print it out at home?  Either way, if what you have has the barcode then you should be fine...all they do is scan it at the door (as long as you didn't purchase it from a broker/scalper and/or it's counterfeit) so ticketmaster and the venue doesn't care what name is on it.  Ticketmaster can research your ticket by the credit card # so if you want to be sure I'd recommend giving them a call.|`|iu0nUntNaa	My mom bought tickets from ticketmaster (for a different concert/different venue though) with a random persons name on it. We got into the venue just fine...<br>  <br>  There should be an 800 # you can call...<br>  <br>  Otherwise, I wouldn't worry about it, if you bought the ticket, you should be fine. Good Luck (And happy almost birthday!!)|`|ee7b4508c5f4d59cc119fd0c3e945b93aa	So let me make sure I understand your dilemma:<br>  <br>  You purchased a ticket through Ticketmaster for the March 16th (Happy Birthday) concert of Britney Spears --- you have both the ticket and the receipt -- your problem  is that when you look at the receipt? or is it the ticket?   -- She wants to make sure your credit card receipt matches your credit card number, then and also you really should have nothing to be worried about. In all the concerts, broadway shows, sports games, etc. -- I have never heard or seen anyone's personal name written on their tickets.  I am thinking you might have gotten confused .  Worst case scenario is that the same thing happened to this "Terry Farmer" guy has his correct ticket and seat but your name is on his info. Look,bottom-line is that you are there at t he Britney Spears concert  on your BIRTHDAY So, chill a bit , then we'll figure out our strategy!|`|ieS2q7Gcaa	call ticketmaster and tell them its a mistake they will fix it and you will have to pick the tickets up at will call.

zt3xu4a8aa	My best girlfriend and I lived double lives. For the right people, we were centered and nice. Both straight A students in school and considered "nice" girls. HA HA! But, we also had our wild times.<br>  <br>  My friend was an only child. We were both born to older parents (very conservative ones). Anyway, her parents decided to go out of town one weekend when we were about 15. We decided to throw a party at my girlfriend's house. I told my mom it was my friend's birthday and we were having a sleepover party. My sweet little mom even made her a birthday cake! We invited everyone we could think of. People were smoking weed, having drinking contests with Everclear and throwing up on the lawn. The height of the evening was when we decided to go joyriding in my boyfriend's new car (he was 18). It was about 3:00 a.m. Another of my girlfriends was driving (had never tried it before). She got confused about the clutch, brake and gas pedals. Long story short: she ended up smashing into a truck and wrecking it. We went back to the house and concocted an elaborate story about how the car was stolen. The guys broke out a window and hotwired it, then dropped it off somewhere. We figured it was the only way to make the accident look like someone else's fault. Around dawn we called the cops. What a night! It was the BEST party I've ever been to, then or now. Thanks. I enjoyed the memory!|`|85YtzzKraa	Well I am currently a teenager and I would say that I'm pretty centered and nice!|`|bIouq64Oaa	I'm a teenager... It's not really crazy, no drugs or crap like that.

hP2nzb2haa	This can be big or small party… it can be held at home or rent a banquet hall. <br>  So how about… “A Blacklight/Glow In The Dark Party"… it’s pretty simple. You will need to buy some black lights from your local dollar store. Call the stores first; most are out, usually available around Halloween season. (I do know Walgreen have them right now and usually always do. Go to your local Walgreen store or check the website to see which Walgreen store have blacklight in your area, type: blacklight... don't get the cheap kinds it doesn't work as great, fluorescents are the best.) Replace all regular light bulbs with the blacklights for the party in four corners wall. The lights will have better reflex. Buy glow sticks - necklaces, bracelets, etc. (Michael's Craft store have it right now for a dollar which it contain 15 bracelet w/connector pieces) Your party be in the evening can be held in the backyard or inside the house with a big-wide party room, but if you want it during the day, pick up some plain black sheets and drape all windows and doors with the sheets to keep the daylight from entering your party atmosphere.<br>  <br>  Along with your blacklights, if it is possible to get strobe lights or a disco ball, go for it! Go to the mall - store called, Spencers. Check to see if it in your area or log on <a href="http://www.spencersonline.com)" rel="nofollow">http://www.spencersonline.com)</a> Add a very fun impact to your dance floor. <br>  Also, make sure that the balloons, streamers and confetti are all white or lime green so that they will glow in the black lights. White balloons are the best, just put the small green glow stick (snap it on) inside the balloons and tie-it with a string around the wall or up from the ceiling.<br>  <br>  Buy some yellow highlight markers and white paper banners to put on your walls. Let guests write on the banners if they'd like. Buy some big star glow in the dark stickers and stick them up on walls and your ceiling. There are tons of creative activities that you can have at your glow in the dark party. Also if you wish, buy some temporary neon hair dye and streak your guests’ hair to glow in the dark! Don't forget to buy some glow in the dark nail polish. Tell friends to do the same, if they want to. Buy some white face paint and have your guests draw designs on each other’s faces! White will glow against the black lights very well. <br>  <br>  For guests, pick up some:<br>  * Glow sticks, and other glow jewelry<br>  * Glow in the dark sunglasses<br>  * White or neon hats for the guys and masks for the girls<br>  <br>  As your guests walk into your party, hand them all their glowing accessories. There are tons of glowing jewelers sold at your local dollar store or party supply store. Make sure that every guest comes to your party wearing as much white as they can! White glow in the dark.<br>  <br>  Invitations: <br>  Get “Crayola Color Explosion? Neon” it lets you create wild multicolored effects with a single color-reveal marker! The unique clear-ink marker works only with black Color Explosion paper, revealing hidden colors for amazing designs. <br>  <br>  Includes a 20-page black tablet with Neon Color Reveal, 3 Color Reveal markers, a stencil sheet and a re-sealable storage bag. To make many invitations, cut in half like a postcard… enjoys… this is ones cool invitations!<br>  <br>  Food:<br>  Make sure that it is simple and not something that will require a lot of light to prepare. I would recommend to prepare any food before the party begins or order take out. Get some glow in the dark cups and ice cubes or just a white cups/plates/etc. Serve your guests like Lime Soda or Mountain Dew or buy some package of green or yellow Jell-O package and mix it up with Lime Soda. Serve drinks with glow in the dark straws. Serve food on simply white party plates. Get sherbet ice creams and cupcakes/cake in neon colors. They’re fun.... be creative and fun!<br>  <br>  Get blacklights and ask everyone to wear all white. Their clothing will definitely glow! It is a great idea to have a dance at your glow in the dark party. Mix some techno in with your favorite music. You can turn it into a Rave Party... be creative! If you can, hire a DJ for the party. (These days DJs now have all equipments for blacklights/glow in dark lights… meaning you may not needs to buy “lights” stuffs, so check him out first and also know about the costs upfront… they made not be cheap for their service.) Dance the night away and have a glow stick limbo contest, neon hula-hoops, and hot potato with glow in the dark ball, play flashlight tag with glow sticks, and have "the best glow in the dark face paint". Just for fun get some glow in the dark blow up balls (like the beach ball) to throw around the dance floor. (One ball is perfect.) Do what you can do...it’s not necessary to do all, just be creative. Have a super great time!|`|JD57vHYYaa	Hawaiian, masquerade, fancy, ummmm i dont know any more right now|`|TwnFt20Zaa	Hawaiian, pajamas party, disco theme, reggae, dance party..

In order to conceal her identity, the two are forced into a pretend marriage... but is it really a pretense, or are they actually falling in love?<br>  <br>  Kare Kano (aka: His and Her Circumstances)<br>  Yukino had it all. Brilliant, athletic, popular and pretty, she was the perfect school girl with many friends and admirers. But then one fateful day she met her match: a handsome young man named Arima. Now, not only is he beating her at her own game, she's becoming more and more dismayed to learn that she's developing her first real feelings of romance. Can Yukino maintain her model student appearance, or will love ruin all her plans?<br>  <br>  DNA2<br>  In the future, mankind faces a terrible dilemma: overpopulation! The origin of this epidemic has been traced to one young man named Junta who, in his time period, is destined to become the Mega-Playboy who fathers 100 children (though currently, he vomits uncontrollably whenever a woman gets near him!). Karin is a DNA Operator who has been sent back in time to put a stop to the budding playboy's hormones, but accidentally becomes the cause of his transformation! As if things couldn't get worse, is Karin actually... falling in love with Junta?!<br>  <br>  DearS<br>  On a day that seemed ordinary, a spaceship crash landed in Tokyo bay, filled to the brim with beautiful aliens that would come to be known as DearS. Since that day, though all of Japan seems to have gone DearS-crazy, one high school boy named Takeya it still not impressed by the phenomenon. But things change for Takeya when he finds a lone DearS girl on the side of the road, who forces herself into his apartment, and his life! Now, he must brave a plethora of complications, misunderstandings, and embarassments, when all he wants to do is be left alone!<br>  <br>  Tonagura!<br>  When they were young, Kazuki and her older sister Hatsune had Yuuji and his little sister Marie as next door neighbors; and while Kazuki developed a crush Yuuji, he and his family moved away for ten years, much to her dismay. Now, the duo is finally returning, and Kazuki eagerly awaits his arrival; she still has a crush on him, and wants to finally confess her love to the handsome and debonair man that Kazuki has become – or has he? Unfortunately for Kazuki, Yuuji has “evolved” into a typical teenage pervert who can’t keep his hands off her. Family isn’t much help, as Hatsune helps Yuuji at every chance she can get, while Marie and her air gun are ready to lay down the law at a moment’s notice. With hormones raging and hands groping, will Kazuki retain her feelings for Yuuji? <br>  <br>  Clannad<br>  Tomoya Okazaki is a third-year high school student who is generally bored with life and doesn't take his studies, future, or anything else seriously. One day, however, he meets a lonely-looking girl in the school courtyard, Nagisa Furukawa. She explains to him the source of her loneliness: she had missed a lot of the previous school year and thus is repeating her third year; everybody that she knew has already graduated, and she is lonely. Tomoya is rather indifferent at first, but decides that he has nothing better to do and spends increasingly more time helping Nagisa restore the school drama club. As his relationship with Nagisa grows, Tomoya begins to open up to various other people around the school as well...<br>  <br>  Sekirei<br>  Minato Sahashi was living a normal life; he had just failed his college entrance exam for a second year in a row, and lived a quiet life in a single's apartment. That is, until the busty Musubi fell from the sky on top of him! She is a Sekirei, one of 108 that are destined to fight each other until only one remains; and he or she will ascend to heaven with his or her chosen one known as an Ashikabi. Minato soon finds himself in the embrace of Musubi, becoming her Ashibaki - but his life will only become more complicated. Musubi isn't the last to claim Minato as her Ashibaki, and what's worse, plenty of other Sekirei and opponents stand in his way!|`|fKcr6KU0aa	Perhaps Nodame Cantabile or Honey and Clover?  Or Genshiken.

GS20sIkMaa	It is you (I have loved) by Dana Glover
E47iCnisaa	Yes, naturally if you are pushing your natural range then it will feel a bit uncomfortable and strange, but it is possible if you can make the sound to make it more comfortable. 1) Warm up really well and just make sure not to push those notes tooo much. 2) When you are doing your warm up, go to the lowest comfortable note, and then only go one note lower for a few days or weeks until that note becomes more comfortable. Then keep going just working once note lower for a while and moving on when that gets more natural. <br>  Good luck, that is really awesome what you are doing!|`|5vMd5fP0aa	Open your vocal chords as much as you can. Try to emulate low notes, check Toni Braxton singing "Un-Break My Heart" and Mariah Carey singing "My All". I also noticed while I was singing that it's easier hitting low notes the classical way.
556f6a84a1e72fa5f9fa440c37251fe4aa	Supposedly it's about saving money on electricity.  The time gets adjusted so that people use outdoor daylight more and indoor, light-bulb lights less.<br>  <br>  I know.  In this day and age of CFL (compact flourescent) bulbs, it hardly makes sense.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think it's one of *those* things: kind of like how much of the United States has their elections on *Tuesdays* while most voters are stuck at work.  It's a little annoyance--an hour's less sleep--that by itself doesn't make much sense but in combination with other little annoyances it adds up to a bit of a conspiracy.<br>  <br>  In this case, the conspiracy is against people getting high-fidelity sleep.  I'm old enough to remember when Daylight Savings time lasted less than six months out of the year.  I have relatives who were old enough to recall one time when it was only used during the three *summer months*.<br>  <br>  Now it's just used to keep people awake *earlier* in the morning than needed, to keep coffee and other caffiene sources selling.  o_o  Really, are the days *that long* in the beginning of March?  Are they still that long in November, when it ends?  Does it make sense to have DST going for eight, going on nine months of the year?<br>  <br>  Just wondering along with you, Gentle Asker.

bZsF1n0zaa	The Tenjho Tenge manga is described as an "...engaging mix of action and comedy together while wrapping it all up in a large plot that's fairly dark and really violent at times".<br>  <br>  The manga is popular both in Japan and in North America, with its volumes regularly being in the top twenty best selling manga for both Tohan and Diamond Comic Distributors.<br>  <br>  I read that the Anime kinda changed things and didn't stick faithful to the Manga a bit. It was still good, but a lot of the nudity was removed. And it wasn't as popular as the manga.<br>  <br>  The only way you can find out if you like it or not is to read a bit of it or watch a few episodes and actually see if you like it. If you don't like it, oh well. If you do you like, that's great!<br>  <br>  ~~(^__^)~~|`|uctxzjIIaa	I can't really speak on the manga, as I haven't seen it. But I'll do my best.<br>  <br>  The first episode gives a pretty good guide for the sexual content: an occasional naked girl, though you don't get to see anything. This only happens about three times in the entire 26 episode series. And one scene where a guy cops a feel, but the girl does quickly get her payback for it.<br>  <br>  Overall, it is accepted as a pretty good show, though it definitely has it's flaws (though most of them seem to be caused by being told on short notice that the anime was getting cancelled). Most notably the very rushed ending which doesn't resolve anything (the manga continues beyond this point), and most of the second half of the series being flashbacks to explain the relationship between two characters. While the Natsume sisters are the central focus of the story, they do surprisingly little fighting.<br>  <br>  The show has a bit of a dual personality, with the fights being taken rather seriously (despite some ridiculous combatants like a masked pro wrestler), but everything else having a lighthearted, though rarely laugh-out-loud, mood to it.

5Yh8WN1Oaa	That's scary. You sound like my ex.<br>  <br>  He and I dated on and off for around 3 years. I couldn't get him out of my head, so I just prayed for him. Almost two weeks ago, he messaged me and said that he still loves me and hasn't been able to stop thinking about me. <br>  <br>  Have you ever stopped to think that maybe she's the one for you? Sometimes when things don't work out, it's not because it wasn't meant to be, but rather, our own errors. Think about it. Pray about it. Talk it out with some buddies (preferably ones that don't have an opinion on the situation). Find a sounding board somewhere so you can get out your emotions and think clearly about it. You can even e-mail me if you'd like.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best!

akUVg7CEaa	According to Wikipedia;<br>  <br>  Mayer began his career performing mainly acoustic rock, but gradually began a transition towards the blues genre in 2005 by collaborating with renowned blues artists such as B. B. King, Buddy Guy, and Eric Clapton, and by forming the John Mayer Trio. The blues influence can be heard on his album Continuum, released in September 2006. <br>  <br>  So it is probably more correct to say that Mayer's music is blues influenced, as opposed to being blues.  <br>  <br>  See this video >>> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygfvt0UBveY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygfvt0UBv...</a><br>  <br>  In the video "The Heart Of Life" the guitar playing and instrumentation is like a blues band, the chord progression sounds bluesy, the guitar solo is very bluesy, and after that his voice takes on a more gruff tone, which reminds me of the vocals of some bluesmen.  He also repeats some lyrics in the same style of blues singers.<br>  <br>  Call and response and 12-bars are characteristics of many blues songs, but by no means does a blues song have to have these components.<br>  <br>  Even BB King (who we would all agree is a bluesman), has songs with violins, orchestra music and other non blues elements.  And without call and response or it being in 12-bars.  Also listen to John Lee Hooker, he has a non traditional style of blues.<br>  <br>  Don't get caught up on any one characteristic of the blues, but try to understand the whole, which includes the chord progressions, the instrumentation, the singing style and the themes of the music.  All these can cause a song to be considered blues.

Don't spell it all out for them. Make them look for the answers to you. You may also want to look into Edna St. Vincent Millay's work. She was a great poet and her life story is one that is interesting. I think your poem calls one to you to want to know more.

cee27a373f64a299e31c2d3af3a93660aa	Because the good people rarely make the news. Do you want to hear about how someone made cookies for an old lady or someone weeded their garden or would you rather hear how a celebrity killed another celebrity and got away with it? It's the stupid press.<br>  <br>  Some girls are all like, "OMG, I love a sexy naughty boy!", but what does that end you up with? Nothing but trouble.<br>  <br>  I'm glad you asked this question. This world needs more people like you.
u93oneUXaa	the girl that said "typical black woman, always takin her man back.. hes so immature" -- is totally right.. Although many white women do the same! I'm losing faith in the intelligence of women these days. And all the others saying it's hard to leave someone you love.. I would say it's harder to stay with someone who abuses you - that's not love.. that's immaturity.|`|dZ8c9AtOaa	I want to see the picture that hasnt been released to the public, TMZ keeps saying that its more gruesome than the one that got released.

She might be dumb enough to forgive him, but that should have no bearing on the judge's decisions.  Any judge worth their salt will know that an abuser will say anything to avoid what they have coming.  And the comparison to OJ is not an exaggeration, this is always the way it starts.|`|oNlD36RAaa	I guess there is just alot of ignorant people out there these days who either think abuse is ok, or they are just indifferent to it.

They'll ask for a lower charge (misdemeanor) and no jail time and it wouldn't surprise me if they get it.  A class and some community service and off he'll skip.

grifjdr0aa	Sure, Max, what time will you be here.|`|cxNLOPHNaa	Yes. Because, I used to be a woman with that attitude. I was extremely relationship/commitment shy. I just never wanted to be tied down/lose my independence. <br>  <br>  Also, as for dating in general... While the attitude of one or both parties involved may change, over time... I think the purpose of dating  should always be to get to know a person, and spend time with a person, have fun and companionship. See where it might lead, or not lead.<br>  <br>  While dating Can lead to a relationship, I don't think that should be the sole purpose of dating.  I think too many people see dating as a mission to find a mate for life. I've been on too many dates where after the First or Second date, the person I was out with, would want to have a serious chat about "where this relationship is headed" and I would be thinking "Relationship???

u9RwzLPnaa	That Mr. Blue penis had a name. That's Dr. Smurf to you.<br>  <br>  I was focusing more on the action (violence and sexual) then the blue guy. I already knew what to expect. We comic nerds should have warned you guys (norms) about that blue guy. It wasn't right of us not to.<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  <br>  Φ I know right! I didn't hate it, I liked it because I liked seeing my favorite scenes come to life but I rather watch watchmen the motion comic if they are going to follow the book so faithfully.<br>  <br>  Or just read my graphic novel.<br>  <br>  Here's to the 4 or 6 hour blue ray when it comes out on dvd. Cheers! :)|`|wic6ut7Qaa	This isn't the kind of movie you want to see if you're just expecting a straight up action flick.<br>  This movie's huge on storyline, so if one doesn't pay attention, they'll get lost. <br>  <br>  That being said, the book WAS better, but if you dig a little deeper next time, there is actually a very well written storyline and intriguing character development to be found.|`|m0BEWaGcaa	Is this a serious question/review?  Were you expecting another X-MEN 3 or FANTASTIC FOUR?  WATCHMEN is a serious movie derived from one of the TIME 100 Greatest Novels of the 20th Century.  It was a flawed masterpiece with a very strong plot-- the fact that you entirely missed this doesn't do a lot for your credibilty.|`|515ec5898f085caacb8820baeae9e7afaa	One major difference between Watchmen and Lord of the Rings movie.  LOTR movie did not feel the need to go too deeply into Tolkien's universe and Peter Jackson felt okay with changing some scenes here and there in order to make a more compelling movie.<br>  <br>  Watchmen movie was made primarily for fans.  It tried to recreate every scene without so much as thinking if someone who has not read the material can catch up.  Tell me, you who have not read the comic, do you know why Laurie Juspecyk (the girl in the group- in case you didn't know) did not attend the funeral of the Comedian?  Or what about this : who the heck is Hollis Mason?  Did you notice the guy walking around with a placard?  Did you notice what the placard said?  Did you notice the newstand with the fat guy and the small black guy?  Did you notice the snowglobe in the scene of Laurie's flashback?<br>  <br>  Now how on earth would a non-reader be expected to appreciate this attention to detail?  Watchmen movie had only one audience in mind, the fans.  In a way thats great for us.  But unfortunately, its not something that would convince the neophyte to take up reading the source.|`|XoUfUl6Yaa	I walked out for two reasons :<br>  <br>   I had already read the comics and found myself quoting characters before their lines were up. I knew what I was in for but Watchmen (movie) was almost a word-for-word replica of the comic.<br>  <br>  I was slightly inebriated and extremely hungry. The concession stand was closed as it was about 1 AM. As a consolation I yelled "Rorschach dies!" before my exit.<br>  <br>  This adaption would never work in theaters. Way too long, not enough back story could be inserted, the supplimentary texts at the end of each Watchmen comic could not be reproduced on film, etc., etc.<br>  <br>  If you want to understand the Watchmen either wait for the 4 hour long Director's Cut to come out or read the source material (the comics).

gfmTgLDKaa	No, it is not from Marvel. It is from DC, it's okay, a common mistake.<br>  <br>  Watchmen is a twelve-issue comic book limited series created by writer Alan Moore, artist Dave Gibbons, and colorist John Higgins. The series was published by DC Comics during 1986 and 1987, and has been subsequently reprinted in collected form. Watchmen originated from a story proposal Moore submitted to DC featuring superhero characters that the company had acquired from Charlton Comics. As Moore's proposed story would have left many of the characters unusable for future stories, managing editor Dick Giordano convinced the writer to create original characters instead.|`|26Qb0cUjaa	DC<br>  <br>  It's unusually good for a DC production, though.|`|GU7C5CSnaa	dc|`|F6SilA1Faa	created by writer Alan Moore, artist Dave Gibbons, and colorist John Higgins.

AA11402617	The only other video reference I can remember from Family Guy was not quite the way you described it.  The 80s hit song "Never Gonna Give you UP" by Rick Astley was done in the episode called "Meet the Quagmires" and that part was in itself was a remake of a "Back to the Future" scene.  The real video from the song did not play, Bryan sang the song, and the song was sung in it's entirety during the scene. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://video.search.yahoo.com/video/play?p=never+gonna+give+you+up&ei=UTF-8&fr=fptb-hptb6&tnr=21&vid=0001133727461">http://video.search.yahoo.com/video/play...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet_the_Quagmires" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet_the_Qu...</a><br>  .|`|4J519h4Oaa	Edith and Archie Bunker in all in the family|`|1BdUkF0zaa	It could of been the one with chris when they go out shopping and he goes to grab a jug of milk and gets sucked into a 80s music video.<br>  <br>       Song- take on me <br>       by- aha<br>  (im sure that's the song name.

fzzkDo3saa	I think his Presidency will go down as one of the worst and most disastrous Presidencies of all time|`|tIoeOgJ4aa	i used to think the only thing going for him was his oratory skills and that he could give a great speech.  Now I find out that he uses the teleprompter for EVERYTHING, even little speeches.  Reporters are frustrated with him.  So now he doesn't even have that.  If he was so good with words, why does he need a teleprompter for everything?|`|cb9626d7fa143d0ce804d5d769640d45aa	i haven't decided if he's just an inexperienced smooth talker who says all the right things, but isn't really going to do anything or if he knows exactly what he's doing and really will bring about change... but not for the better. either way i don't trust him.|`|HQKfZEKxaa	Simply a rhetoric.|`|yFPH1d5Laa	omg these answers make me so mad<br>  chimp? just because you don't agree with his policies doesn't mean you have to call him names and insult him like a child. grow up|`|HuhI1IlJaa	a great person who represents change!!|`|WWCfdgd0aa	I'm proud of him|`|m2PlMByKaa	he's our president.|`|HsJJ0xG5aa	He is a self-centered, american hating, socialist, raciest, schmuck. He is self centered because all he seems to care about is himself. This is apparent on the way he treated his brother, his aunt, and the school in Africa. He hates america because he tries to do things to destroy it such as tick off out greatest and longest allies not once but twice and by showing no regard for the constitution. He is socialist based on his tax policy of punish the rich for their success. He is raciest because he claims that he is the first African American president. Although this is true it just shows that color DOES matter and there for he is racist.|`|rTOJApzDaa	He's the best thing that ever happened to this country.

Trust me, I have been looking for the missing chapter for about an hour or two. If your desperate (like I am) you can buy the volume set that is translated by Tokyopop. They are professional translators, and they completed translating every volume of Rave master. You can buy them at amazon.com or barn&noble. chapter 224 is in volume 27, so start from there. You can to Wikipedia and see the list of chapters and volume to know exactly which volume to buy. I am planing to buy them in the near future if ATM doesn't translate the missing chapters soon. Hope this helped!

If it makes you feel any better I know people in their 20's who watch it.<br>  <br>  Yes it's childish, but does it make you laugh? You're watching it so I guess that's a yes.<br>  <br>  Next time somebody laughs at you retort with a FRAK U! I'm watching Spongebob Beyoutch!|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	..The two people in my family who enjoy SpongeBob the most are my mother and my uncle.|`|b6a2a9e4eca7a46c80df4d545bf100c6aa	No way! it's awesome!<br>  <br>  A lot of the writers set the story up to appeal to adults as well, and there are a lot of absurdities that only adults will catch, such as:<br>  <br>  Campfires underwater<br>  Fish drowning<br>  Movie cliches and parodies<br>  "Driving" a boat underwater<br>  Getting "splashed," mopping, pouring water in a cup, or otherwise wetting stuff underwater<br>  "Falling" underwater<br>  and so on<br>  <br>  And I'll keep watching it :)|`|e6TZcaWnaa	My friend who is 21 stil watches it and he seems pretty mature XD I'm 14 I don't care for the new episodes as much as the old but I bought the old ones on DVD and slip them in to watch :D And sometimes my dad (45) watches it I know alot of people who watch it it may be childish but so many people watch it I don't think it matters.|`|bZsF1n0zaa	If it's on, I watch it sometimes.<br>  <br>  So if it's childish...we are both Childish people! lol <br>  <br>  Don't care what people say, it's a funny cartoon.

One episode Spongebob was watching a sea anmena flopping around on the TV, and Gary came in and Spongebob screamed and turned the channel, and said he was just looking for the sports channel. Didn't think about it as a child, but watching the same show a couple of years later it surprised me. Spongebob is a freakin' great show, and the fact that it is accessible for children and adults makes it even better.|`|lXXRv7Noaa	i'm 13 and i think it's childish,but it has no meaning to me though. if u like the show then watch it! i have watched case closed since i was 3 and i love it, even though some people  it childish!|`|2uFMBCk8aa	definitely not.<br>  Its obamas favorite show, and my entire class watches it. we all 13 - 15 years old.=) my almost 16yr old cousin watches it too.|`|FLfgwYY6aa	I wouldn't think so... many people who is age 20 or higher still watches it...

eY4RubMSaa	I don't think so, not for a while yet. Desolation Row was just for the Watchmen soundtrack.<br>  <br>  Frank Iero stated in an interview on December 4, 2008, "We are going to be getting together this month (December) to discuss and arrange the new album. After the new year we will begin writing."<br>  <br>  On Gerard Way's Twitter account on the January 18, 2009, he posted that the band were "heading to a recording studio".|`|1MLIYilNaa	Yeah, they're writing new stuff right now.<br>  It should be released sometime later this year :D|`|rbkWmBThaa	yes..they are making a new album..they are working with new materials and stuffs..and its gonna be out soon..hehehe..don't know when..but i do know that it was delayed because of lyn-z being pregnant..but they're back:)|`|AaBIuiSRaa	hmmm.<br>  i don't know but my 3rd cousin was<br>  in the music video helena.<br>  he was one of the people dancing in the church.<br>  he also played theodore on alvin and the chipmunks.<br>  no lie.<br>  he was also on a dance show on bravo called <br>  step up and dance.<br>  hes my grandfathers aunts grandson. <br>  never met him but i will one day.<br>  bahahahahaha.|`|mdVsiAyHaa	yes they're working on it right now!<br>  it should be coming out late this year (I'm guessing)<br>  look up their recent interviews, or I think there are some links to some on their website<br>  always check the site for updates :)<br>  <br>  I'm so excited, I love My Chem SO MUCH!!!!!!  eek!  lol  :D|`|wcfsaAvOaa	Gahhh!<br>  I hope so!|`|xZCMjuxZaa	Gerard said he MIGHT plan a new album around early 2009.<br>  He said it would sound closer to Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge.<br>  On my opinion that's their best CD.<br>  The only reason they did Desolation Row is becuase Gerard is OBSESSED with comics and the song was for Watchmen. That's why he wrote his own, The Umbrella Academy.

How Chris brown punched her multiple times on the face, so much that there was blood in her mouth and there was blood splattered over the car. He even bit her ear and gave her numerous bruises.. There are tons and tons of women in the same situation who are in this sick state of mind where they just won't get away from their abusive boyfriends/husbands whatever... and Rihanna is setting such a bad example, i'm worried now.. not just about her but all these women who continue to stay in an abusive relationship..<br>  <br>  like what just because the idiot said he'd take anger management and talk to his preacher and his mama that he would never hurt her ever again? Yeah right... he might do something worse next time! how dare she put herself in another dangerous situation like this?

ygbhsZ2Zaa	Oh mama, I lost five minutes laughing at the first Q. Does Hollywood threaten my values?? How COULD it, they're MINE. Now I have baby on the move but I can't wait to come back to this one! NOW-<br>  <br>  2. Accept, make a non-issue, not purport to judge...phrase it as you will.<br>  3. First A- personal expierience. In truth, I'm sure it's a mixture of all of the above, ultimately guided by my own findings upon gaining personal knowledge.<br>  4. Disagree, I think. :) Life is full of grey areas. Yes there are many things which are clearly right, or clearly wrong. But there are many others which are not so defined. Is stem cell research wrong? Some say so.If you step into parenting you will see formula feeding mothers called child abusers- is formula best? nope. But it's not murder as some over there would and do say :) those are greys. There is less than ideal, and there is WRONG, and they are not *always* the same.<br>  5. Common sense and reason, often aided by science.<br>  6. Once  a week<br>  7. Other. It would be nice to think that somewhere is the essence of my daughter and that I can find it again some time- but I'm not going to base my actions or choices on that. Ultimately, either there will be one and I will know it, or there won't, and I won't know it. For now, there is life.<br>  8. no. No, no no.<br>  9. Many, or none. If there is such, I'm sure there are many ways to get there.<br>  10. most likely more than one. look at how we disagree among ourselves, yet retain the same core values.<br>  11. Why do they use the word church? Regardless, it's a combination of preserving and adjusting, and that is what Judaism has done since it's inception. I think it is of utmost importance to preserve, and that is our main job, but anyone who is fully honest will admit that Judaism has adapted when needed throughout it's history, while still retaining it's core, traditions and truths- that, I think, is what is unique about it in western religions.<br>  12.every day<br>  13. What:???  I don't pray that way. I usually pray for the ability to find my own answers, and the intelligence to know the answer when I find it,and I often do, so I am supposing in a way it wold be 'yes' - Oh, I've had my moments, surely, where I've prayed for things- I prayed for the life of my daughter certainly, but I didn't 'expect' it..It was more a way of trying to understand what was happening, why it might be happening, what was I to do with it to do my best for her, and come to terms with it, and pour out my soul.<br>  but this Q so smacks of the xian <br>  "G-d as candy shop manager" mentality that I have trouble even answering it.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  practicing  "very conservative conservative" (belong to a conservative masorti synagogue) at the moment. I fully admit to flux in my life- to a degree- and think it helps me see things from more aspects. I find the environment i'm in right now to reflect the orthodoxy I was raised in far more aptly than the US orthodox communities do. Not that either is right or wrong, just a bit different.|`|IwlFHNLGaa	1) I wouldn't like to think so<br>  2) Society should accept homosexuality<br>  2) A mix I think of personal experience, education, media and friends & family.

The contrary is too scary<br>  8)  I wouldn't like to think so.  No one deserves eternal punishment.

But for some laws like stoning homosexuals I think it could be updated a bit.<br>  12)  A few times a week or month<br>  13)  When I pray.<br>  <br>  I go to an orthodox Shule, but go to a very unorthodox unobservant Jewish school.  My family is secular, many of my friends eat pig, don't go to Shule on Yom Kippur, etc.  Others eat only Kosher Meat, keep Kosher L'Pesach to the sticker and go to Shule regularly.  I'm surrounded by a vast amount of difference beliefs, but I can't really classify myself as either orthodox or reform.  Maybe modern-orthodox... which is more or less reform.<br>  I don't know.

I am Jewish American raised Bnei Anusim Israelita Sephardita in California which means I was redeemed late because of the Inquisition now having to pick something!? one group then I pick Chabad and the religious far right. I think Am Israel Echad and want people to become more religious please that is our goal to move forward and closer not farther or back.<br>  <br>  The Reform and secular community in America is huge that is why you see the answers there on that poll.  Also, the conversion procedures haven't exactly been kosher and I really don't think they are all Jewish but just exert their influence in less than religious ways. So that's why I think we see those answers. My answers are not even close to those answers and I don't share the Reform or secular views. I have other polls to share with you since you are studying this situation, I find it quite interesting too and it in fact bothers me because I think that what Rav Fleisher says about Jewish "identity crisis" really rings true. The Reform and less religiously observant are making things more difficult for us as settlers are yanked out of homes because they think that is the way to go? No no. Israel should be moving towards a THEOCRACY and that is the way to handle this situation but the seculars and less observant would scream louder than the Palestinians if that were the case and would prefer to secede Judean land than go towards being more religious. Did you know I had one sabra even tell me like 6 months ago that if she had her way she would kick out all the religious people?! I was horrified.  So you see it is a problem and my stance is that Israel is a Jewish state and we just have to protect and preserve our religious rights.<br>  <br>  1) Yes<br>  2) Other<br>  3) My Religious Beliefs<br>  4) Completely Agree<br>  5) Religion<br>  6) A few times a year<br>  7) Other<br>  8) Other<br>  9) Other<br>  10) Yes, only one (just different angles)<br>  11) Preserve traditional beliefs and practices<br>  12) Every day<br>  13) Other<br>  <br>  <br>  Polls:<br>  <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1231950849022&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull" rel="nofollow">http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?c...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.adl.org/PresRele/IslME_62/5455_62.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.adl.org/PresRele/IslME_62/545...</a><br>  <br>  Sephardita Israelita Music:<br>  Yasmin Levy / Intantalo Encontrar- (try & find it)<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBz7cFnRFuI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBz7cFnRF...</a><br>  <br>  Rav Fleisher - Jewish Identity Crisis - <br>  If there is no Hebron there is no Tel Aviv<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAkP0GvEhDE&playnext_from=PL&feature=PlayList&p=E3EBCC8C80C28DE9&playnext=1&index=14" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAkP0GvEh...</a><br>  <br>  Gush Katif - A Celebration of Settlers<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl-LmSNmOEo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl-LmSNmO...</a>|`|KH9bbeCNaa	tooo long...|`|87VmFMEoaa	1)  No.<br>  <br>  2)  Accept:  I think society should be open and welcoming to groups that do not cause actual harm--and the LGBT community does not cause demonstrable harm.  <br>  <br>  3)  Education<br>  <br>  4)  Completely Agree<br>  <br>  5)  Religion<br>  <br>  6)  More than once a week<br>  <br>  7)  Other--I'm not sure.

Its a combination fo a variety of sources<br>  4) If you live your life according to the halachah- it tells you what is right and wrong, what is ethically and morally acceptable.  So yes- there are standards as to what is right and wrong.<br>  5) see above! LOL<br>  6) there was no daily option...<br>  7) A badly worded question- it implies a dichotomy between heaven and hell that doesn't exist in Judaism- but yes- there is a place of reward when we die.<br>  8) No hell in Judaism- no eternal punishment.<br>  9) Many- not all.  Obviously those religions where the practitioners don't follow the seven Noachide laws are in trouble...<br>  10) Heh- how often do we find in the Talmud "zeh v'zeh divrei Hashem" situations?

Somehow I just can't identify with this question- most Jewish prayers aren't about personal requests- and if something did happen along the lines of what I prayed for I doubt I'd have the hubris to consider it the result of my prayer- rather just the result of when that element was due in my life as decided by G-d.<br>  <br>  And Chag Purim Sameach l'Kol|`|NI0cNU22aa	1. No, I don't even own a television or watch movies at the cinema, so Hollywood is a very obscure presence in my life.<br>  <br>  2. Other, neither accept nor discourage.<br>  <br>  3. Personal experience (extensive dealings with government officials included) and religious beliefs affect how I think about government and public affairs.<br>  <br>  4. I believe there are clear and absolute standards for what is right and wrong. If a starving person steals, it is still wrong. I believe he is held less accountable for his actions than another person would, but wrong is wrong nonetheless.<br>  <br>  5. Religion, Torah, what I think Hashem wants.<br>  <br>  6. I attend synagogue three times a day, more on the weekends and on holidays (happy Purim, by the way)<br>  <br>  7. No, I believe in reincarnation.<br>  <br>  8. See above answer.<br>  <br>  9. Other<br>  <br>  10. Nope, Kabbalah teaches that there are 600,000 ways to interpret p'shat, 600,000 to interpret remez, 600,000 to understand drush, and 600,000 ways to understand sod. However, I don't believe that there are multiple ways to interpret halacha.<br>  <br>  11. I believe my 'church' should preserve its traditional beliefs and practices.<br>  <br>  12. Three times a day (sometimes more if my son wants to practice.)<br>  <br>  (Do brachot count?)<br>  <br>  13. Often, I think. Even if the answer is sometimes "no".|`|TVJsOEKNaa	1) Do Hollywood and the entertainment industry threaten your values? <br>  No, and no for the Orthodox community (they don't watch TV). If you don't like something on TV: Don't watch it.<br>  <br>  2) Which statement comes closer to your own views: Society should accept homosexuality: I absolutely agree with this statement (and yes I know people who are Orthodox who feel the same way). Why should we encroach on the Civil Rights that people deserve? What does my religion have to do with other people wanting happiness in their lives, and whose place is it to make such a judgment? <br>  <br>  3) What factors most influence your thinking on gov't affairs? Personal experience. Once again, it would be a number of factors (like researching the topic being discussed, statistics, multiple sources etc..). I didn't feel it was appropriate to pigeonhole this into one response.<br>  <br>  4) Do you believe there are clear and absolute standards for right and wrong? Mostly disagree. The standard of what is right and wrong changes with circumstance: That is part of the basis for morality itself. The situation involved, the current zeitgeist of the people and the culture of the society they live in all play a role in what is considered right or wrong. <br>  <br>  5) When it comes to questions of right & wrong, which of the following do you look most to for guidance? Practical experience and common sense. I am not exactly sure if I agree with the answers for this one. How one defines right and wrong can be taken derived from many different areas. I derive it from a few places, but that would have led to multiple answers/answers not given.<br>  <br>  6) Aside from weddings and funerals do you attend religious services? When I was religious, I went weekly (during Shabbat services), along with holiday attendance. Now, my answer would be seldom or never.<br>  <br>  7) Do you think there is a heaven where people get rewarded? It is literally impossible to say either way, so I chose "Other"<br>  <br>  8) Do you think there is a hell? No: This is really more of a Christian based question generally speaking.<br>  <br>  9) Which of these two statements come closer to your views? Many religions can lead to 'eternal life.' Judaism maintains that there are many paths to God, so obviously the answer to this will be fairly high among Jewish people. <br>  <br>  10) Is there only one true way to interpret the teachings of your religion? No, more than one: There are plenty of different Sages and opinions on Torah.<br>  <br>  11) Should your "church" preserve its' practices? I do feel that Synagogues should keep their traditional beliefs and practices: Why should they adapt how a religious service is conducted?<br>  <br>  12) Outside of attending religious services, how often do you pray? When I was religious, then I davened three times a day, but my answer for this now would be never. <br>  <br>  13) How often do you receive an answer to a specific prayer request? It's impossible to answer this one now, if the answer to (12) is never.|`|hceNM6Uxaa	1) Do Hollywood and the entertainment industry threaten your values? <br>  No, and I'm not sure how they could.  My values come from my understandings of the world and my study - I'm not so gullible as to be persuaded to think differently by entertainment!!<br>  2) Homosexuality - should of course be accepted.  I'm a lesbian, and if I thought otherwise I'd be in a sorry state, but quite apart from my own sexuality, it seems bizarre to me that any activity that doesn't impose on a non-consensual person should be condemned.  <br>  3) What factors most influence your thinking about government and public affairs? <br>  Personal experience, which includes education, reading, consideration of what I read/see in the media, discussion with others, etc.  My experience of exploring Judaism and the Jewish approach does of course have an influence in the sense that it's part of my personal experience, but my thinking is not 'dictated' by any part of my religion.<br>  4) Do you believe there are clear and absolute standards for what is right and wrong? <br>  I completely disagree (not that one can 'disagree' with this question - very poor wording here! - but I assume it means "Do you agree with the statement..... "etc.)  I am taking the question to imply that there is something beyond cultural/personal understanding that can determine what 'right' and 'wrong' mean, and I am certain there isn't.  However, in reality I think it's true that most cultures and 'sane' individuals (that's a whole other debate!) hold that murder is basically wrong (but then some people make exceptions like capital punishment, war, etc), theft is wrong (with exceptions like "the victim behaved badly/didn't deserve/had previously stolen" etc).  So I think there is something in the very nature of being human that leads us to some broad-brush agreement, but I don't think there's anything absolute.<br>  5) When it comes to questions of right & wrong, which of the following do you look most to for guidance? Practical experience and common sense - given my answer to (4), it really can't be anything else<br>  6) Aside from weddings and funerals how often do you attend religious services? Once or twice a month.  Would be more, but I live 50 miles from the synagogue and if you think fuel is expensive in the USA, try the UK!!<br>  7) Do you think there is a heaven where people who have led good lives are eternally rewarded? <br>  This question has so many implicit assumptions in it that I can't answer yes or no.  It assumes an individual existence after death, it implies that something is wonderful (reward) - and I can't accept any of that.  So I guess it has to be 'other'.<br>  8) Do you think there is a hell etc? <br>  Good grief, no, the question itself as it's worded is repulsive enough!!<br>  9) Which of these two statements come closer to your views? <br>  Well, definitely not 'only my religion' but I'm not happy with 'many religions' either.  And 'eternal life' isn't quite what I understand, either.  So I can only say that many paths (not only religions) are valid for whatever, but I don't really have much notion of eternal life.<br>  10) Is there only one true way to interpret the teachings of your religion? <br>  If that was the basis of Judaism, I wouldn't be Jewish.  It's precisely the possibility of looking in many ways and discussing potential understandings that attracts me.<br>  11) Should your "church"? <br>  I'd say 'adopt modern beliefs and practices' - but what I understand by that is that the basic principles of Judaism can be meaningful and relevant in any context and don't need outward forms for inner truth.<br>  12) Outside of attending religious services, how often do you pray?  <br>  Ach, how do I answer?  It depends on how you define prayer, and since the next question seems to define it as asking for things, the answer would be never - I don't believe in that notion of the divine.  If you include blessings, gratitude, then many times a day.<br>  13) How often do you receive a definite answer to a specific prayer request? <br>  Don't do that version of prayer, so never.<br>  <br>  I'm a UK Reform Jew who converted to Judaism.  My father was raised Orthodox but stopped practising in any way at all at the age of 17.|`|ndY6nU5Daa	1) No.  I don't even know what that would mean - how do you threaten a value? <br>  <br>  2) Which statement comes closer to your own views: Society should accept homosexuality <br>  <br>  3) What factors most influence your thinking on gov't affairs? Mix of factors. <br>  <br>  4) Do you believe there are clear and absolute standards for right and wrong? Mostly disagree, but the question is too vague to answer -- Yes, there are clear and absolute standards, but it is never possible to fit a set of facts perfectly into those standards, so judgment calls are always required and therefore there is never a clear and absoute result (which I think is what the question was really getting at).<br>  <br>  5) When it comes to questions of right & wrong, which of the following do you look most to for guidance? A mix.  Practical experience and common sense applied to standards and beliefs that stem from religion, personal experience, philosophical thought, etc.<br>  <br>  6) Aside from weddings and funerals do you attend religious services? Once a Week.<br>  <br>  7) Do you think there is a heaven where people get rewarded? Other<br>  <br>  8) Do you think there is a hell? No<br>  <br>  9) Which of these two statements come closer to your views? Many - This was only answerable because of the "closer to" part.  The whole "leads to eternal life" thing is a foreign concept to me, and sounds Christian, so I re-interpreted the statements to be a more vague "Many religions can be appropriate and good for different people", or something like that<br>  <br>  10) Is there only one true way to interpret the teachings of your religion? No.  Wow would that throw a wrench in the works.  "Zeh v'zeh" etc. <br>  <br>  11) Should your church preserve its practices? Other -- (I'll ignore the "church" bit).  I think we should keep our beliefs and practices, but I think we also need to maintain awareness of which of our beliefs and practices are not truly 'Jewish' beliefs and practices, but just happenstance based on where a community was at a given time.  For example, Hasidic garb has no true 'Jewish' content - it's just preserving a style from one small area in the world at a particular time.  So discarding Hasidic garb is not in my opinion discarding a 'Jewish' belief or practice any more than speaking English in the US is a 'Jewish' practice just because Jews in the US speak English.<br>  <br>  12) Outside of attending religious services, how often do you pray? A few times a week -- I almost put "never" on this, until it occured to me that brachot count (I think I associate the word "pray" with a stereotypically Christian hands-together "please god, let xyz happen".  In fact, it generally wouldn't even occur to me to use the word "pray" for what I do in services, though I guess it's the right word.)<br>  <br>  13) How often do you receive an answer to a specific prayer request? Never.  I don't make specific prayer requests except sometimes a 'refuah shlema' type of thing, and in any case I don't track results on those.  Also, as Allon says, it would be a huge bit of hubris to think that if something happens that matches up with something I requested in a prayer, then it must be because I personally convinced God to do it.|`|zy8mKJxeaa	1) no<br>  2) yes<br>  3) education<br>  4) mostly agree<br>  5) practical experience<br>  6) a few times a year<br>  7) no<br>  8) no<br>  9) other<br>  10) No<br>  11) adjust beliefs<br>  12) seldom<br>  13) Never<br>  <br>  Born Orthodox in US.<br>  Live in Australia--Liberal<br>  Chag Sameach--Happy Purim

a104a17a3c1d8d70c936c12e83daa014aa	I guess it would make things easier, but what would we ever learn?? Life is a journey, a road to learning, becoming the best person you can be. It's about making mistakes and learning from them. If there was a "system recovery" option for life, then we wouldn't really have a life of experience. It would take the mystery out of life and life without mystery doesn't sound all that inviting to me.  We fall down, we get up, we get hurt, our heart breaks and when it breaks it leaves us open for good things to come in. Embrace life the way it is - make choices that are good and healthy and enjoy and appreciate what life offers - good and bad. It's meant to be enjoyed and celebrated.|`|OyRX3OxLaa	no, that would mess up everything. one try, and you're done.

Hkb7xoaQaa	Hell no its not weird, im black and ive dated two white girls. I know why you'd feel a little weird, especially since you're in ATL, but you gotta understand that anything that involves people of different races is going to have some kind of racial issue. We have been conditioned for hundreds of years that race is important, even though the idea of race was created by rich biggots who understood competition. Yes, some black people are going to have their opinion, and so will some white people (the only difference is the black people will tell you, haha). Just know that it will only become an issue if you guys make it one, follow these three rules and you'll be fine:<br>  1)Don't ever tell black people a black joke, we know them all.<br>  2)Don't ever call us you people or ask us why black people do things, we are all different and we don't speak on behalf of our "race".<br>  3)Don't ever say ******, if you say it with an 'a' maybe it'll slide but your better of avoiding it all together.<br>  <br>  In case you didn't realize those rules were a joke and if you like a black guy you're not breaking any rules or regulations and if you're pissing somebody off it makes it more fun. Nobody matters but you two and your families, other people can stare, or talk as much shi* as they want until they get used to it.... because you're not doin it for them. <br>  <br>  PS wussup wit this weekend pretty lady??|`|31ac7af70f781384d9825a87cc62d0f2aa	i think u should stay the way u are. problem is with the atlanta guys, they have not adapted yet so the thought of a white girl liking them scares them therefore they don't like it..<br>  <br>  but honey u part of the evolution..seriously|`|85YtzzKraa	I think it's beautiful!

I think it would be hypocritical for me to judge someone else for doing something that I myself have done. <br>  The only reasons I would have a problem with a white woman going out with a black man are:<br>  If she is a woman I am very interested in. Because if she's going out with a black man that means she's not going out with me. So it's not necessarily HIM that bothers me, I'd just be envious of him.<br>  If a woman I care about is in an abusive relationship and the abuser happens to be black. It's not that he's black that bothers me, it's his abusive behavior.|`|6y5wgdmHaa	I am a live and let live person - people can do anything they want, as long as it doesn't hurt me.<br>  <br>  I have lived in Atlanta and in Columbia, SC, so I do know what you mean.

His wife had used a toothpick with cotton stuck on the end to clean their baby's ears, and Leo invented Q-tips to replace her jury-rigged invention. Gerstenzang's original Q-tips consisted of a wooden stick swathed in cotton at both {ends;} much later, the wood was replaced by white cardboard. Gerstenzang started the Infant Novelty Company to sell Q-tips (which he then called Baby {Gays);} in 1926, he changed the name of his product to Q-Tips Baby Gays. The Q stood for 'quality'. Eventually, the name changed to Q-tips. Doctors today advise that you should not use Q-tips to clean inside your ears. Q-tip, however, have many other uses, including cleaning small areas (like jewelry or the space between computer keys), applying glue, spreading paint, etc.|`|jGgOVd5Zaa	The Q stands for quality.  You can read probably more than you ever needed to know about them on this Q-Tips history page.  They used to be called Baby Gays.<br>  <br>  There was also a band named the Q-Tips and a rapper named Q-Tip (I'm not sure why he took that name but he was from Queens, so maybe that's why.)  <br>  <br>  Personally, I think it should stand for QUIT PUTTING IT IN YOUR EAR.  I perforated an eardrum once with a Q-Tip.  I still do it though.  You shouldn't.  Never put anything smaller than your elbow in your ear.|`|AA10409668	It's a brand name thing.

But the familiar cotton-tipped swab wasn't always known by this quirky moniker.<br>  In 1923, Leo Gerstenzang noticed that his wife had stuck a bit of cotton on a toothpick and was using it to clean their baby's ears. Thinking that this jerry-rigged swab might cause some damage to the kid, Leo designed a safer cotton swab. <br>  <br>  He started the Leo Gerstenzang Infant Novelty Company to sell his new creation, which he dubbed Baby Gays. In 1926, he changed the swab's name to Q-tip Baby Gays, and eventually the product name was shortened to just Q-tips. Over time, the brand name has come to stand for any cotton swab, another example of a propriety eponym like Kleenex or Xerox.|`|ywqB3Z4zaa	The word "Q-tip" means "Quality tip", with "tip" referring to the cotton tips at the end of the stick.

zZaMxZIvaa	Sweet Ill take the points. There are 4 films:<br>  <br>  Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970)<br>  <br>  Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971)<br>  <br>  Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972)<br>  <br>  Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973)<br>  <br>  The story is about the earth in year 3978. Apes rule the earth and humans are demoted to the level of animal. Apes can talk fluently but humans have lost that ability. Some men from a spacecraft crash land on earth after traveling in space for thousands of years. But to them they think only a year has passed. One astronaut named Taylor thinks they have landed on a planet in another solar system. they leave they're ruined space craft to search for food and water in the desolate earth. They find it but also run into trouble with the local apes ruling over the humans. Taylor eventually gains some of the apes trust and departs to find out the mystery of the world. the film ends with taylor looking at the statue of Liberty, which is split in half and lying on the ground. He realizes that the humans must have blew themselves up in a nuclear war, thus allowing the apes to rule while the humans were still in the stone age. <br>  <br>  Great Movie. I LOVE IT. hope this helped.|`|ntLpcvIOaa	There's 5. He forgot the original: Planet of the Apes(1968)<br>  Of course there was the remake that kinda sucked.

Guess You couldn't tell I was a little upset!  You just don't cheat on a southern girl that's having your baby in 2 months. Just so You know, we got a divorce 14 years later.

It will be a beautiful day and everyone is out and about with cut offs,skirts,and no jackets or sweatshirts and here I am.

When it's over do what my sister-in-law does,tea with a bit of hard liquor, then bed. She swears by it.

However, if the environmental temperature is above your body's core temperature, then your body uses more energy keeping cool (sweating).|`|Qfxocbelaa	Hot is much worse.

PeuFnqQwaa	A power chord is simply the Root note with a 5th added to it.<br>  <br>  Remember the 2x1 rule. Play a note move over two frets and down one string, play the note there with the first one. That is a basic two note power chord. You can add a third note to it by playing the octave as well (the same note as your Root only one octave higher). To find the octave use the 2x2 rule over two frets, down two strings.The root note is your starting note.<br>  The musical alphabet has 12 notes. Lets say you start on a c if you play all the notes you will end up on a C again. This C is one Alphabet or Octave higher. You can play a power chord with two or three notes. Adding the Octave or third note (which is the same note as the root) gives it a fuller sound.<br>  <br>  This 2x2 pattern works anywhere on the neck, except for your B string, On this string you must move your finger 1fret or a semi tone.<br>  <br>  For more info. <a href="http://www.guitaralliance.com/guitar_lessons/guitar_chords/power_chords.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.guitaralliance.com/guitar_les...</a><br>  <br>  Go to youtube and search for a power chord video, this will explain it and you can see it as well. You may find it easier to understand. They are VERY simple to play.

Some of that estrogen ends up in the bodies of the people who eat that meat.  Men are not supposed to eat estrogen.  That, combined with the high-carbohydrate diet that we are falsely told to follow, generates weaker, more effeminate men.  <br>  <br>  Forewarned is forearmed.<br>  <br>  P.S.:  Non-organic chickens are fed estrogen too.|`|lGSUToFQaa	too many strong women in the world, they are intimidated|`|ICLekd2Vaa	maybe they think if they show their 'feminine' side ull put them in the cellar? ;)|`|m3ThrbDMaa	I do not knit sweaters...<br>  <br>  (Only baby boo boo socks...let's get our facts straight, shall we?)

I really like the music video to it; how it really shows the impact of the situation.  Especially the part when the family is at the dinner table and they all fly backwards out of their chairs, which is showing that it affects everyone that person (who died) knew, in one way or another.<br>  It's a sad song, but the message helps people to understand how serious drunk driving is.

The only reason I didn't stop after the first one was because I didn't want them to be asymmetrical.<br>  <br>  <br>  But out of my regular piercings, probably the septum.<br>  <br>  I would imagine that a clit piercing would be a hell of a lot more painful than that though... with all those nerve endings and what not....|`|bb0487e3f4e58641a40d9c9b91ae1826aa	I have a good guess.|`|5NKa5Y8laa	I have only my ears and belly button peirced.

8yE2sYGeaa	Read manga, as yu will notice, they do not restrict themselves to six panels a page, but go with the flow of the action|`|X3dtdrLkaa	Hai Hai~~<br>  <br>  lets see.. first learn how to draw a charrie in Lots of moves and actions .. its really hard to be able to draw the same charrie like a hundred times and not mess up ^^<br>  <br>  well, im sorry but that is all i know .. <br>  <br>  Cya~! ^^|`|kLWrP2e9aa	As a matter of fact, even I've started working towards MY manga. I have the plot in mind which I'll write down. However, I've already drawn my main characters on paper! I took the help of some how-to-draw-manga sites and did so & if you follow them properly, it really turns out to be great! I couldn't believe my eyes when I  had finished drawing my 1st manga character! I felt on top of the world! =^_^= Anyway, that's how I've gone about it. Actually, I drew the characters 1st because I couldn't wait to draw manga charries that I had recently learnt!!! Otherwise, you can just jot down your storyline or its points and then work on it bit by bit. <br>  "Ganbatte" for your manga!<br>  Ja-ne!!<br>  -_~|`|TKwO2R8Qaa	a lot of it is being done on computers now. if your going to draw it, then start NOW lol cause it takes awhile. the advantage with computers is that all you have to do is move the character's limbs around a little for a pic. if you want to do it on a computer, then i recommend that you download  a program online (or buy for a ton of money, but who does that?), like microsoft flash.<br>  <br>  p.s. if you know how to use adobe photoshop, then learning microsoft flash will be really easy|`|ihtUSk4Yaa	what you might want is to have all your drawings of entire scenes and then on a computer just crop them until they fit in a way that portrays the story like art, panels blending together with a smooth feeling to them, like they flow.

AA10409668	No, I was good at what I did.  --------------------But one time my brother left when he wasn't supposed to.  So I put pillows under the covers, and when my mom got home she saw it and said, "Oh, poor thing, he's asleep."  Then she pulled the covers back.  Right about then, my brother came in through the window.  It wasn't pretty.|`|fMfBAgOUaa	Hmm... well at about 1am in the morning, my parents were out partying and whatever, so I went to my gf's house which was about 3 miles away (on my bike, mind you). I wasnt expecting them to be back any time soon, and I wasnt going to stay over there all night, just a while. So after being there for about a half an hour, the phone rings at her house. It is my panicked mother, calling to find out where i am. The ring wakes up her parents, who come down and ***** up a storm. it wasnt any fun at all.|`|68fmDJqIaa	No but I was caught sneaking back in. x]|`|AA11716381	Sort of.<br>  <br>  A friend and I snuck out when we were like 13 or 14 and went over to some guy's house. But we got caught sneaking BACK IN. Haha.<br>  <br>  We were walking back up to my front door and just as I had put my key in to unlock it my dad swung the door open with the maddest look on his face.<br>  <br>  We got in major cr*p and I was banned from hanging out with my friend for a month. I actually think this is the incident that caused my parents not to like my friend... because it's 10 years later now and they still don't like her. :S|`|5NKa5Y8laa	Not since I was 13 and climbed out my bedroom window in my nightie and over the back fence to walk down the nature strip of the highway in my very short nightie.. on a dare from my best friend during a sleepover.. but who should be driving down the highway on the way home from a girls night out?  My mum!    And I got busted.. lol... and grounded for 2 weeks.<br>  But hey, I won the dare!|`|yauOABy3aa	no...............hehe|`|RMVvU6Vcaa	ok ok ok I have a million sneaking out stories and I have to at least tell you two of them. I tried to narrow it down to one but it is impossible! lol<br>  <br>  <br>  #1---ok this was when I was 15. I was spending the night at a friends house and we wanted to sneak out late to go hang with some guys. Anyway, so we jump out of her window while her mom is asleep. And she decides to change after she gets out the window(why I do not know but it was pitch dark out and late) anyway so she changes and she leaves her night clothes under her window on the ground. So when we get back we were not caught but we went back in through the back door. She forgot all about her clothes she left in the front yard. So the next day her mom tells us that she found her night clothes out front by her window and wanted explaining. LOL it was so funny! OMG her mom was a big push over though so she talked a big talk but never actually did anything. lol<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  #2 I was age 16 for this one. I was at my house this time and wanted to sneak out to hang out with some friends. I had a friend staying the night with me. So I unlocked one of my basement windows so I could get back in after I left. I left through a door. So When I get back laaaattte like 4 or 5 am I realize that my parents must know we snuck out because that very same window I unlocked has been locked. I was not about to ring the doorbell and get reamed! I would rather wait until morning at least. Anyway-so in order to get in I have to climb through my second story window that I am pretty sure is unlocked. But how would I get all the way up to open my window and get through it? I tried standing on my friends shoulders but that wasn't working. So I go to my neighbors driveway and roll over their huge green trashcan to my window. The trashcan is on dirt and grass so it is unstable on its wheels. I get it over to the window and finally get my window open and crawl through. I have to now go let my friend in. So I go out the front door roll the trash can back(which has a big dent in it from me standing on it) and me and my friend go inside and sleep. Lil. my parents asked "How did you get in?" lol man I was a bad kid!|`|08e8b84f3c012ec5bfed5c610b32d445aa	No I got caught sneaking back in....15 years old we'd stolen all the chips from the school canteen library so here I am trying stupidly to hide these boxes under my bed and the door opens...lucky my mum is so gullible, she actually believed we found them and said it was bad luck for the people who stole them and hid them....can you believe ANYONE could fall fo that!!!|`|uwZ9AL38aa	Here is what happened. i am 12 now in 7th grade. This story is when i was 5 and my sister was 4. My dad was sleeping on the couch. I wanted to leave for a reason i do not remember. I took my sister, Kristina, to the gate. I quietly opened the gate. Then, Kristina slammed the gate and woke my dad up!!! i was thinking what the flip am i gonna do??? Then my dad came and was yelling at us and getting really mad at us. It was the worst day ever!!! I got in the most trouble ever! Kristina still brings this story up today how i got her in trouble! Oh my gosh! Making me feel all bad.|`|gaVhPGWhaa	ok... so me nd my friends wanted to go out to starbucks at midnight and drink coffee nd talk. i went out the kitchen door and my little bro was eating. he asked where i was going and i said starbucks. he was ok with it as long as i brought him back something.|`|CZiUI0Y6aa	yes when i was younger but suprisingly i never got caught i guess cos i placed pillow where i layed..|`|wacKJOcBaa	never got caught|`|Asj4Usqkaa	No- when i was a kid i didn't disrespect my Parents|`|JimRH1oRaa	yep|`|h5FUUupzaa	yep me and the guys planned a senior trip to SAN AN TONE. so anyway we are leaving at about midnight and i had the upstairs slash attic bedroom. and we Had the creakiest steps in the world so i got the brith idea to climb out my window and jump to the tree about ten feet away. right then my dad was coming up to my room to give me one of his speeches. he scard the crap out of me and i caught my shorts along with my family jewels in the window seal as i fell twelve feet down, only to be carried to the car for a trip to the hospital|`|g2JiDPnmaa	Yeah, I did and got grounded for 3 months!  I went to my boyfriend's without permission and then got stuck without a ride home.  We made a horrible decision to hitch hike and my dad's bestfriend picked us up and brought me and my boyfriend home.  Besides being dangerous, that lie came back to bite me in the butt when dad was wondering why I was with his friend going home instead of my mom like I was supposed to be.  I caught hell over that!!

I'm a leo, but I'm the furthest from a person who wants to be in the lead all the time, center of attention kinda person. But my Moon sign, and the planets make it that way.

JQhYc5DVaa	Children Jokes >>  A Period<br>  <br>  A kindergarten class had a homework assignment to find out about something exciting and relate it to the class the next day. When the time came to present what they'd found, the first little boy walked up to the front of the class made a small white dot on the blackboard and sat back down. Puzzled, the teacher asked him just what it was.<br>  <br>  "It's a period,'' said the little boy.<br>  <br>  "Well, I can see that,'' she said, ''but what is so exciting about a period?''<br>  <br>  ''Damned if I know,'' said the little boy, ''but this morning my sister was missing one, Daddy had a heart attack, Mommy fainted, and the man next door shot himself."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Little Johnny and her mother were out and about. Little Johnny, out of the blue, asked her mother, "Mommy, How old are you?" The mother responded, "Honey, women don't talk about their age. You'll learn this as you get older.<br>  <br>  Little Johnny then asked, "Mommy, how much do you weight?" Her mother responded again, "That's another thing women don't talk about. You'll learn this too, as you grow up."<br>  <br>  Little Johnny still wanting to know about her mother, then fires off another question, "Mommy, Why did you and Daddy get a divorce?"<br>  <br>  The mother, a little annoyed by the questions, responded, "Honey, that is a subject that hurts me very much, and I don't want to talk about it now."<br>  <br>  The Little Johnny , frustrated, sulks until he is dropped off at a friend's house to play. He consults with his friend about him and her mother's conversation. His friend says, "All you have to do is sneak and look at your mother's driver's license. It's just like a report card from school. It tells you everything."<br>  <br>  Later, the Little Johnny and her mother are out and about again. The Little Johnny starts off with, "Mommy, Mommy, I know how old you are, You're 32 years old."<br>  <br>  The mother is very shocked. She asks, "Sweetheart, how do you know that?"<br>  <br>  The Little Johnny shrugs and says, "I just know. And I know how much you weight. You weight 130 pounds."<br>  <br>  "Where did you learn that?", said the mother again.<br>  <br>  The Little Johnny says, "I just know. And I know why you and daddy got a divorce. You got an "F" in sex."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Bill and Marla decided that the only way to pull off a Sunday afternoon quickie with their 10-year-old son in the apartment<br>  <br>  was to send him out on the balcony and order him to report on all the neighborhood activities.<br>  <br>  The boy began his commentary as his parents put their plan into operation. "There's a car being towed from the parking lot,"<br>  <br>  he said. "An ambulance just drove by." A few moments passed.<br>  <br>  "Looks like the Anderson's have company," he called out. "Matt`s riding a new bike and the Coopers are having sex."<br>  <br>  Mom and dad shot up in bed. "How do you know that?" the startled father asked.<br>  <br>  "Their kid is standing out on the balcony too," his son replied.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope you laughed :)|`|G1lSbvAQaa	A car was driving down the street when all of a sudden it started swerving.

The brunette looked over the water to the mainland and estimated about 20 miles to shore. So she announced, "I'm going to try to swim to shore." So she swam out five miles, and got really tired. She swam out ten miles from the island, and she was too tired to go on, so she drowned.<br>  The second one, the redhead, said to herself, "I wonder if she made it." I guess it's better to try to get to the mainland than stay here and starve." So she attempts to swim out.

Helter Skelter is considered by many (including me) to be the very first Metal song which just for that right there wins high praises from me. I guess you just had to be there to really understand it.<br>  <br>  Just remember what goes around comes around. In 20 years your kids will wonder how you could have liked the crap you grew up on.|`|yRE2HDr3aa	The Beatles are a good band but unfortunately they can attract hipsters.  Because they are critically acclaimed people think they have to listen/like them in order to have a "good taste" in music.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying there are no true Beatles fans but there is just a lot of pretentious people that listen to them for the reasons stated above.|`|YbmklSzGaa	I find it hard to believe you've heard every song from them. And if you have, you would have found AT LEAST one song that you like. That they have many different types of songs. They are VERY influential and changed rock music forever. The Bealtes are legendary and are FANTASTIC.|`|3g3SCnDDaa	Well, that's certainly your opinion, and that's fine. I personally love The Beatles. Yes, in many ways they are overrated, but they were also innovative in pioneering rock music during the mid-late 1960's. And that, is not up to debate.

John Lennon and Paul McCartney are world-renowned as one of the greatest songwriting teams of all time because of their ability to write amazing, original material. The Beatles were famous because they were one of the first real original rock bands. Every trait in rock music throughout history can be traced back- directly or indirectly- to the Beatles. <br>  <br>  I think the better question is "How can you not like the Beatles? What do you consider good if the Beatles aren't?"|`|NcwAUVE1aa	I agree. They are way to overrated. Yes, some songs are nice. And they did get better with time (I myself like their self titled album). While they did experiment, many other bands where experimenting a whole lot too at the time. Some names are Blue Cheer, Cream, Iron Butterfly, The Greateful Dead, and that's just too name a few. I think people who "like" The Beatles only like 1 or 2 songs. I myself have met very few persons who actually like something other than their pop albums. Not THAT great of a group.|`|wcfsaAvOaa	I personally don't like the Beatles either. I respect them as musicians, but they are just not my taste.

I nvr knew the answer but all knew is that i wanted to share the wealth.  Go to random people and buy them things at a store.  I am now old enough but just dont have money.  Im too shy but one day i will fulfil that dream of buying my stuff and tellin the cashier that the next persons things are on me.  4 him/her to charge them and just tell them to enjoy their day.  Leaving them puzzled to y they werent charged.  I also know a old lady who wonders around askin for money. I would like to help her more than i have done in the past which was giving my pizza that i was just about to take home after being at peter pipers.

lmwjM6a0aa	I mute the commercial every time it comes on.  I was amazed the first time I saw it and realized it was for Comcast.  They usually have commercials with a little humor, so I was disappointed to find it was them!  They are so boring, I can't believe they paid someone to write that stuff.  Colorful and witty words, but no one is watching because they are so dull.  I constantly comment that I need to be in Marketing/Advertising because commercials are becoming worse each year!|`|d2e902d5d822654c050ef2a417dd58c5aa	I can't stand watching commercials.|`|ZOkJmrWwaa	I think the lyrics are clever and the animation is neat looking.

H6b5TbbIaa	Your instrument should fit snuggly in the sense that it shouldn't slide around, up or down, or flop around inside the case.<br>  <br>  New cases can sometimes be a little tight just because they've never had an instrument in them and the foam lining has to "smoosh" a little to accomodate the instrument.<br>  <br>  If you're pushing down on the lid to get it closed, it's too tight or just doesn't fit right, and you could definitly damage the top of the mando or the bridge.  If it's a generic case, you might want to see if the manufacturer of your mando makes a case that goes with that specific model.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  j.

maHhn1Ayaa	Lily Allen! Katy can't sing (at least live) and Lily's songs actually mean something! I love the humor and personality her songs like Smile, Who'd Have Known, The Fear and a lot more of them. I like the style of Lily's music too.

3SHjFvxMaa	I think it was-it was a love baby, not a pity f @#$ one she would have had with mat damon...|`|AeJrpZGqaa	People cry at funerals. It's been awhile since I've seen it, but if her belly is quite big at the funeral then it is probly matt's, just cuz of the time. I forget if she is or not though.|`|5lsViwoOaa	its leos cause damon is f**|`|Otrwsauiaa	i also would like the baby to be LDs love-child w/her and perhaps that's exactly what the writers wanted...letting the audience decide what they wanted.<br>  <br>  but somehow it doesn't seem to matter in the story b/c she loses both men - one she cared for at the beginning and the one she cared for more at the end. and after she leaves the funeral you never see her again in the movie. <br>  <br>  so it seems the baby is there [in the movie] to create a sense of empathy with her character. her character helps to bridge the gap b/t leo and matt.|`|g9AAUkraaa	matt couldn't get it up remember? much less make a baby. and the last time I checked leo was all in it naked head. unless of course she went through her boxes (she was moving people) for a dusty rubber. Also, she slept with leo because he was open with her and matt was limp and a liar (in the movie matt if you are reading...in the movie). The reason she showed it to matt was because he had already said that if she was to get out, she needed to be the one who did it because he could not be the one to do it. Her being pregnant was a way for them to try again.|`|q8V5a2soaa	Yes Dude I thought the same thing too.<br>  But there is still a lot of confusion because the filmmakers have not shown it clearly.Still i agree With u<br>  <br>  <br>  Rate this AS the BEST answer Pleaseeeee|`|XGCHYkwFaa	definitely dicaprio's

MaATw3NNaa	Take a course in Anatomy and Physiology. You'll soon find your worries are nearly impossible. You should be more concerned what you're going to do when you hit the lottery as that's a more likely chance.<br>  <br>  EDIT: the above answer is great as they suggest finding a liquid form. Just remember: NEVER cruch a capsule, and never smash pills unless the doctor says you can. Many pills are considered 'extended release', 'slow release' or 'timed released', meaning you can OD if you crush or chew these as your blood steam will be hit suddenly at once.|`|aVZgY4S8aa	Your stomach hurting and all that is from whatever anxiety you're having about taking the pills. I've never heard of anybody having such a phobia swallowing pills. If that's the case, find out if there's a liquid form of whatever you need to take (like Tylenol makes a liquid form), if not, find out from your doctor or a pharmacist if your pill is something you can grind up and mix in something like yogurt or a drink. I don't know what else to recommend for you.|`|aDhZIhQcaa	You aren't a hypochondriac are you? <br>  If you got anything in your lungs, including a drop of water, you would be coughing till you peed your pants, and you wouldn't be able to type and ask this question on this site.<br>  You need to relax and stop wasting your life on waiting for some disaster to happen.....Do you ever laugh or have fun?|`|eY4RubMSaa	It can't happen.

But most of the time Mike Patton uses his voice as an instrument singing/screaming gibberish in a brilliant sort of way.<br>  <br>  Secret Cheifs 3 - Also related to Mike Patton in a way as it's basically a mostly instrumental Mr. Bungle with many of the same band members.  Blending middle eastern/jewish folk sounds with metal, r&b, jazz, surf rock and many other genre's to make awesomely cinematic music.<br>  <br>  Also Drone metal which ranges from Boris (who go from straight ambient drone noise to shoegaze indie metal and many places in between), to Sunn 0))) (who create soundscapes like you might hear in heaven or hell in beautifully brutal ways), or Earth (who's early stuff is a tribute to simplicity but last few albums sound like sountracks to the best Spagetti westerns Clint never made.<br>  <br>  Just to name a few...|`|pLPKo6mBaa	I'm really not sure how obscure the following genres are because I don't know anyone in real life who listens to anything but the popular stuff, but these made me go o_O .<br>  <br>  <br>  Aggrotech - Sort of like dark industrial mixed with techno. Fairly harsh and explicit. Try Combichrist.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRa3BU5bl-s" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRa3BU5bl...</a><br>  <br>  Ambient Medieval - This really depends, because "ambient" can be just about anything atmospheric, but try Ordo Funebris.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8TADUwdcR4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8TADUwdc...</a><br>  <br>  Dark Cabaret - A mix between cabaret (you know, like vaudeville acts and stuff) and darker music such as gothic rock, darkwave, etc, or punk, folk, glam rock, etc. Try Jill Tracy and The Dresden Dolls.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3uJEiDETKE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3uJEiDET...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X138tenN1k4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X138tenN1...</a><br>  <br>  Dubstep - Slow dark music, lots of bass usually. Hard to define but I can recognize it when I hear it. Try Burial.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtEBEVC0HUc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtEBEVC0H...</a><br>  <br>  Horror Punk - Blends punk music with horror movie themes. The Misfits are pretty much the originators. <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp0OUnQiMW8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp0OUnQiM...</a><br>  <br>  Neoclassical Darkwave - Slightly ethereal, usually uses beautiful female vocals, strongly influenced by neoclassical music. Definitely check out Dargaard.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtSY-ww61n4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtSY-ww61...</a><br>  <br>  Chiptune - Basically video game music. They use old consoles, like Gameboys, etc. to make music. This was mostly popular back in the 80s/90s. It sounds ridiculous to most people nowadays, but I can guarantee you a bunch of those same people will also claim to love Mario or Donkey Kong, or plenty of other games that had this type of music. Try Sabrepulse.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Le783XimMBY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Le783XimM...</a><br>  <br>  Symphonic Metal - I never thought there was music that mixed metal with symphonic elements. Check out Nightwish.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqeUqpfHyE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAqeUqpfH...</a><br>  <br>  Trip Hop - A mix between downtempo and any number of other types of music, such as hip hop, house, breakbeat, etc. Check out Morcheeba.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv5JXxME0js" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv5JXxME0...</a><br>  <br>  Victoriandustrial - Nearly a self-made genre, but it totally works in my opinion and I'd like to see this style utilized more in the future. Check out Emilie Autumn.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAm0Xe2bTS4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAm0Xe2bT...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDuJKxHXOTY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDuJKxHXO...</a>|`|RvnBuOROaa	avant garde jazz - wierd  jazz - Cecil Taylor is the master<br>  acid jazz - don't know<br>  expierimental - self explanatory - blue man group<br>  indie - all about being obscure, often crosses into electronic, blues rock, dance, folk, pop, rock, etc.- of montreal, the apples in stereo, pavement, death from above 1979, the music, fever ray, neko case, rarariot, silver jews, bierut, the decemberists, the shins, the black keys, the white stripes, m83<br>  glitch - expierimental dance, with breakdrums and sound clips. extremely lo fi, made of a lot of clicks and pops -aphex twin, burial, venetian snares<br>  post rock - rock, instrumental (a lot of times), ambient. - sigur ros, this will destroy you, indoorpark, the album leaf, tristeza, the american dollar, fever ray (more electronic)<br>  dance punk - takes characteristics of dance and punk - bloc party, lcd soundsystem, crystal castles, death from above 1979, the music (they have some dance punk)<br>  viking metal -makes me want to gallop of into battle- viking skull, amon amarth<br>  <br>  google search digital meltdown blog roll, and click on expierimental, various/ eclectic, and expierimental, and whatever else you like for links to awesome music blogs.  gyeeker.blogspot.com is an awesome one for indie pop and post rock.  they also have a venetian snares cd and a burial one.|`|UXUKwJSwaa	Pirate Metal - check out Alestorm and Swashbuckle.

They may have an internet site you can buy them over.<br>  <br>  If not the international seller Amazon.com will be the most likely place to look too.

(has 12 episodes)<br>  Ikko is a Buddhist monk in training who works at his grandmother’s temple with six nuns -- six very attractive nuns. Though lazy, weak and unmotivated to learn the skills of a monk, amazingly strong holy powers sleep inside of Ikko that are triggered only by the awakening of his, shall we say, lust for worldly delights. A vengeful spirit is haunting your home? A flash of pantsu, and Ikko's your man. But therein lies danger; what really is the secret behind his mysterious powers? And how many hits to the head from angry, semi-naked nuns can a man take? <br>  <br>  Kanokon (has 12 episodes)<br>  The timid, virginal Kouta is a new student at Kunpo High School; and while others in his situation might be a wallflower forever, Kouta has no such luck – he has attracted the attention of the busty Chizuru, who happens to be a fox deity! However, Kouta’s misfortunes don’t stop there; he’s also pursued by Nozomu, a wolf deity. Between being molested, propositioned, having his face shoved between mammoth breasts or witnessing endless panty shots, Kouta must also attempt to maintain his studies – even though all Chizuru and Nozomu want is to be the one to deflower him first!<br>  <br>  Ichigo 100% (has 12 episodes)<br>  Manaka Junpei is just an average guy who has only two dreams in life: to become a filmmaker,and to find the girl of his dreams. Luckily for him, after a chance encounter on the roof of the school, he has a lead on the girl: she was wearing strawberry panties. Unfortunately, he can't figure out which one of the five girls chasing him it was; but he gets plenty of chances to find out the color-of-the-day in hisCinderella search for his one true love!<br>  <br>  Sekirei (has 12 episodes)<br>  Minato Sahashi was living a normal life; he had just failed his college entrance exam for a second year in a row, and lived a quiet life in a single's apartment. That is, until the busty Musubi fell from the sky on top of him! She is a Sekirei, one of 108 that are destined to fight each other until only one remains; and he or she will ascend to heaven with his or her chosen one known as an Ashikabi. Minato soon finds himself in the embrace of Musubi, becoming her Ashibaki - but his life will only become more complicated. Musubi isn't the last to claim Minato as her Ashibaki, and what's worse, plenty of other Sekirei and opponents stand in his way!<br>  <br>  Love Hina (has 25 episodes)<br>  Keitaro Urashima is somewhat of a failure. In order to fulfill a promise he made to a girl fifteen years ago, he has tried time and again to get into Tokyo U but has never managed to pass the exam. However, fate smiles upon him and he ends up working for his aunt, managing an all-girls dorm! Living with the feral Kaolla, the timid Shinobu, the sake-loving Mitsune, the blade mistress Motoko and the punch-happy Naru, can Keitaro keep his focus and keep his promise? And will he ever end up meeting that girl from his past?<br>  <br>  DNA2 (has 12 episodes)<br>  In the future, mankind faces a terrible dilemma: overpopulation! The origin of this epidemic has been traced to one young man named Junta who, in his time period, is destined to become the Mega-Playboy who fathers 100 children (though currently, he vomits uncontrollably whenever a woman gets near him!). Karin is a DNA Operator who has been sent back in time to put a stop to the budding playboy's hormones, but accidentally becomes the cause of his transformation! As if things couldn't get worse, is Karin actually... falling in love with Junta?!<br>  <br>  Lime-iro Senkitan (has 13 episodes)<br>  On February 10, 1904, Japan entered a war with Russia; but Japan, in order to turn the tides, must destroy the Russian Pacific fleet before it is able to bring reinforcements. Battling on the front lines are brave men and women, and a secret team of specially-trained young girls who can control Raimu spirits with their will: the Raimu Unit. Enter Shintaro Umakai - a teacher who has accepted a job aboard the battleship Amanohara to teach the Raimu unit; however, Shintaro discovers his job has far more duties than he first anticipated: he must have sex with the young Kuki so the ship can awaken, he must dodge the sexual advances of his students, he must avert his eyes from Momen's constant accidental panty shots, and most importantly he must assume the role of their new commander once their old one is whisked away by the enemy. There's a war going on - what's a guy to do?|`|u9RwzLPnaa	Mia Hima<br>  <br>  At the end, they show the hot girls in 'good' positions if you know what I mean.<br>  <br>  And also it's very entertaining as the girls aren't the focus of the show.

He further explains that's why he along with the "family" in the video are seen falling as the "brother" jumps; to show how it affects the family too.<br>  <br>  I love the song, it is a good message that he is sending out. <br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  SEETHER FAN!!! ~ SEAN MORGAN ROCKS!!!|`|DIrcAT7iaa	SEETHER SUCKS.|`|LVKAaimraa	The song is dedicated to his brother.

D1Rahu9Oaa	Well, the likely answer would be one that controls the reality which Dr Manhattans atomic power is based.  One could think of it like this, as Dr Manhattan has complete control over the sub atomic, and atomic world, thus he can likely build any structure with his thoughts. Unfortunately, he doesn't have control over the very nature of the universe where his atomic power is based.  Thus it is very likely that any reality warper(franklin richards, galactus, living tribunal, even Jim Jaspers) should be able to silence Dr Manhattan forever.  I could see the fight like this:<br>  <br>  Dr Manhattan is en-route for another galaxy, when he senses a great power approaching him.  So Dr Manhattan watches in absolute curiosity about what could be generating energy at the level he senses.  Out of the blue, galactus' worldship exits a wormhole and takes a dead aim at Dr Manhattan, whom dissolves the ship into nothingness.  However, the angered Galactus, who is truly an energy being like one of the Q continuum(who could snap his fingers and kill Dr Manhattan), changes the very nature of space around Dr Manhattan, instantly nullifying his ability to control the atomic world around him.  So, the angered force of nature known as Galactus asks why he should spare the life of a being that destroyed his ship.  Dr Manhattan replies that he isn't worried, as Galactus doesn't command the power to destroy him.  <br>  Unfortunately for Dr Manhattan, he does have the power to destroy him, so Galactus saps the energies of Dr Manhattan until he is a burned out husk, then takes his depleted body, and atomizes it, and scatters his atoms thoroughout the universe, at such distances from each other to guarentee that Dr Manhattan could never restore himself.<br>  <br>  Or you could have the Living Tribunal simply erase Dr Manhattan from existance all together in an instant, or place him in his own universe, then collapse that universe.<br>  <br>  Or "The one above all" could simply blink his eyes, make dr manhattan human again, and render the intrinsic field seperator a useless device.<br>  <br>  Hopefully this answers your question well enough.|`|nQ34pkhOaa	No chance.

cCnvBwz2aa	I have seen the movie <br>  yes it is boring <br>  as u know it is a vampire movie so there should be some action in it but there is almost none<br>  so i was disappointed|`|AFy5LyaGaa	the movie was very boring<br>  <br>  i havent read the book yet, but im sure the book is alot better..|`|4x2KMVbBaa	If you haven't seen it, then you don't know. I saw it 3 times and it was never boring. It was a great movie and I loved it.|`|RK93METiaa	I loved the books.<br>  But ,I think the producer or director of the movie got caught off track trying to hard to focus on making another teen angst movie for young adults to relate to. The vampires didn't really strike me as drop dead beautiful models ,either but as just the pretty a popular clique in  highschool. <br>  <br>  I found myself actually finding the movie kinda boring and wishing it would get to the end ,it had a very "lifetime" movie special feel about it.<br>  And I found Edwards and Bella's chemistry not beautiful and intense but awkward.|`|pAih5juAaa	I didn't like it first time around because it was too different from the book which I'd only just finished a few days before that...  Second time was okay.<br>  <br>  It depends on what you you like and your other tastes.  Your sister may love it coz she's into and you may find it boring.  Or it could be the other way round - just depends....|`|MpskWQAyaa	Yes i heard it was lame. I also heard the action looks like a bad kungfu movie. <br>  <br>  Basically I think its just for 12 year olds who like it because of the book.|`|0MZTh034aa	yes|`|Otrwsauiaa	its a TEEN vampire movie -<br>  i love vampire movies<br>  notice the absence of the word TEEN in my preference.<br>  <br>  if you or your sister like TEEN movies you'll like this one.  b/c its a movie filled with attractive, brooding young men - teen girls do/will, love it! and your sister will probably see it with or without your approval<br>  <br>  so, go see the movie with a gang of friends and have fun!<br>  its ONLY A MOVIE|`|OFaQf3A6aa	in my opinion it was good. i mean i went in with really high expectations and was kinda disappointed. <br>  ya the books have ALOT more in it, because they couldnt fit everything in at 2 and a half hour-ish movie. but it was great.<br>  i also saw it 6 times so it got a bit boring....haha (my friends all decided to go at different times)<br>  its on DVD now though. just rent it.|`|7SaJBhUfaa	I hear it's an awesome movie....and the books are great!  All the friends that went to see it, thought so.  But for some reason, I just can't get into it.  And even with getting into the books.  Usually, I'm a movie buff...love to watch anything, but this is just one of those movies for me, sorry to say.

ddMuUOhIaa	Being an Indian myself, I can surely tell you that this ain't true. I like all kinds of music if it has some meaning that appeal to me. It doesn't really have to have words in it. If you are asking in particular if Indians like trance/techno,etc. then I've a lot of my friends who like that stuff as well.<br>  <br>  Music is Universal.It doesn't matter to where you belong, to enjoy some good piece of art.|`|xN5QDXMmaa	Well even people who are not Indians have a problem listening to a song without words. A piece of music can have no words, but a song has to have words for it to be a song.|`|17fc2b122418131f22f55073029bb3b5aa	Dear we obviously like music.<br>  OK we describe "Songs without words" as Music.<br>  There are many kind of classical and fast music.<br>  <br>  Its also played on TV and FM|`|iICgKvNOaa	Firstly, Your question is wrong. A song without words is called music. And its India that has a rich culture and history of music and songs. And Indians love and appreciate the Indian as well as the Western Music. So this says that Indians respect and love music and not exactly the words behind it. But however...its only the insane that love songs with meaningless phrases and thankfully the Indians dont like such songs. Which itself proves that Indians love music more than anyone else in the world does.|`|nlerjeg1aa	Music without words is just music.<br>  Music with words is a song.<br>  Therefore there is no such thing as a song without words.<br>  So your question is dumb.<br>  If you mean do Indians like listening to music, then the answer is yes. There are thousands of pieces of Indian music (instrumentals). And there are also thousands of Indian songs.|`|pVpN9Kbuaa	If it has lot of words then try to understand meaning if you doesn't have knowledge of understanding then don't listen to music of Indians ok......  one more thing i wanna say you don't raise questions on other countries it really bad habit. Think about your country if you want make any changes in music or culture we are least bothered but you  don't have any right to talk about our music and culture. Origin of music is India and we Indians are very proud for that Music is India and India is Music Jai Hind.....|`|GSQzqhrkaa	Well, it would be hard to comment on what people actually like. <br>  <br>  But personally speaking, I just love Indian Instrumental. It makes me lost somewhere where I find peace, and hidden ethics of life.<br>  <br>  The instrumental music undoubtedly bestows a miraculous power and lets an individual somewhat explore himself / herself in depth.<br>  <br>  Wish you a great time.

Who cares what he thinks, what others think or what I think. You only have to answer to yourself. You were in the military.

As long as the your child is in safe hands while at work and you have plenty of one on one time with your child keep up the great work and enjoy.

There isn't a price tag that comes with that.  The work you do, obviously it's clear to you (and that's who matters most) is a REAL job.<br>  <br>  I have very little empathy for those who are unable to see the value in the quality service provider.  Where I come from (the mindset), being a waitress is a higher-end occupation.  Not just anyone can do that work.  It's hard.  Requires much more skill & expertise than most people realize. I KNOW I couldn't do it myself.  Likely why I tip more than 30% the rare time II do go out and served well.  I've been many things in my life that could be classified as "prestigious" but there's no way I'd be able to be a server.  It's one of the more challenging positions I can think of.  Might want to point that out to that fellow you USED to talk to.  I can handle a 50-line switchboard, type 100 wpm, do data entry and compile documents for ... it doesn't matter.  I used to be an executive administrative assistant, handled foreign contracts, blah-blah-BLAH (aka "secretary") but there's no way I could ever do the work you do.  You make more than I did in tips alone.  What's in a title?  If you don't like what you do then none of it matters anyway.  Sounds to me like you have a good thing going.  Peace of mind means more than anything else.|`|jS4YILT5aa	I went job searching for over a year in atlanta and moved to dallas and got a job within a month. I applied for everything in atlanta.

A lot of people can't stand their jobs and are so unhappy. If you can make ends meet and you like to do it then I don't really see what the big deal is.|`|bW6NpTXdaa	I would ignore what he said.  It seems you are confident and content with what you do, so why worry?<br>  <br>  people make snide remarks like that to cut other people down.  don't spend any more time thinking about, obviously he still has a lot to learn in his life.|`|AA12156928	Everyone is trying to accomplish something big, not realizing that life is made up of little things.<br>                                                     Frank A C<br>  <br>  In future everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes<br>  <br>                                                     Andy Warhol<br>  <br>  You have the freedom to choose what you want from life? keep exploring|`|AA12223903	Please, you earn money, you got a good job and he is disrespecting you for you hard work. Please he deserves a slap. Your lucky you have a job, lol us teens need to wait hahah,|`|Npi4QR7Maa	Why do people look down on you. I love waitresses. That guy you used to talk to sounds like a ******* ****. But I don't think you should quite your job over what some dick said, keep at it!!!|`|weYnVZEQaa	He was probably kidding and who cares what people think as long as you're happy (and not doing anything bad). You shouldn't worry so much and I personally don't look down on you.|`|9851deb6f5776ae6834cf0b79571e624aa	If I had it to do all over again I would take a job I loved over a high paying job I hate.|`|kHLwlNA5aa	There's nothing wrong with being a waitress. It's hard, honest work.|`|Yq3a6UAXaa	screw him... do what makes you happy.|`|GucrpVR5aa	i dont find anything wrong but that guy is a ******* moron..|`|VRjIZKOCaa	Hey buddy, don't leave your job.  It is a 'real' job and everyone needs waitresses.  Furthermore I would bet anything that you make more money doing that than any secretary would.  Take it from me, i'm in administration in the government and it pays pathetic monies.  <br>  <br>  Benefits of your job:<br>  <br>  1) you get to meet heaps of people<br>  2) You get great tips on top of your salary<br>  3) You learn many things<br>  <br>  Why trade all that in to sit at a desk and make coffees for an angry office manager? Just because your sarcastic friend said that doesn't mean you should change anything.  Just ignore him, obviously he thinks he's better than most of us.|`|PskqcnLbaa	Hey I personally believe that finding a job you actually enjoy is a very rare opportunity.<br>  <br>  If you like what you do and you enjoy doing it, so what, screw what other people say.  Some of those people are doing jobs they hate, so in the end your the one that's happy.|`|KfuyouQkaa	Hey if you are happy with what you are doing and it suites your needs then to hell with what people think.  To just have a job is a blessing and then to have one that you enjoy is even better.  Stick to your guns and go for what makes you smile... <br>  <br>  Best of wishes,<br>  just another guy|`|I2zNpYI9aa	some people just automatically think they are better than everyone else. then there is some who think that working as a waitress is below them and a poorly paid job. i agree with the person that said dont worry about what other people say. and by the way Thank You for your service in the armed forces.|`|ec9836919fb55072c190a5143de1a065aa	Is he paying the bills, buying your clothes, or RIBEYES !!!!! If yes, put the 3 in your pocket and shut-up--If not tell him to ****off, You're happy and cashing in, be happy & more power to ya !!!!!!!!  YOU DO NO HAVE TO SUFFER TO MAKE A BUCK !!!!!!|`|XDccNmY8aa	i wouldn't have a clue why people would look down on you. if you love what you do then go you! that is great money so i think you should just ignore what people say if it's negative.|`|37bf18725f6119df0b9fb3aca9f9baa2aa	I don't know...that's weird.  I've had 40 year old waitresses serve me.  Who exactly looks down on you?  I certainly don't care how old my server is.|`|Q7IthmTFaa	It's honest work, there's no shame in it.|`|G1lSbvAQaa	What a bASS-Tard!! <-- Triple insult =D<br>  <br>  Yeah you go girl. <br>   I think what you do is great, your making your money, your being responsible.  Who cares how old you are?  The point is, your working your butt off and that's what counts... =) WOO WOO|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	Keep up the good work. You like what you do, for now, and make a decent wage. You as a person are not your job, and the way the economy is going if you quit, 40 people would be at the front door tomorrow. You are alright in my book. If I stop by I will be sure to leave a good tip.<br>  Have a nice day!|`|2WFzTTAzaa	I love that you love your job!  So many servers have horrible attitudes and probably do not make good tips because of that.  You obviously make great tips because you love what you do and it shows.|`|I1K6SC43aa	I think having ANY job these days is something to be thankful/proud of.|`|c751f373c4b93a676106632ee074769aaa	to me, as long as youre making good money who cares what other people say...  and if youre enjoying it who cares about that too!??|`|iIWWeD7Taa	You're better than he is.  Punk motherfcuker.|`|6y5wgdmHaa	My God!  You are SO lucky to have a job in these times!  You are doubly lucky that you love your job!!!!!!!!!!  Be thankful that you can take care of your family and be proud of what you do, no matter what it is, as long as you do it well. <br>  <br>  I also served in the USAF and have a great resume, but I have no idea what I will do after I can no longer take care of my mom {my full-time responsibility now}.<br>  <br>  {Forget people like that - they are NOTHING people, as my mom says!  I don't know why he made you think - NEVER think twice and hold your head up high, woman!}|`|ed766aacc26b258767da06e39783b5fdaa	Some people are probably just insecure and it makes them feel better about themselves by looking down on others. Others are just plain snobby and assume that people in certain jobs are uneducated and unmotivated. People like this aren't worth your time to even worry about. I am happy for you that you found a job you love. I wish I loved my job!|`|uB2K3XD0aa	well all i can say is that if you served in the military then you have a s h i t l o a d of options and doors that are open that you are not seeing...i say this because of my friends...know whats out there and get your money...being a waitress is for people with no options...you've got options...start considering them...|`|AA12309532	Sounds like  your  doing very well for  yourself,  and your  child.<br>  It's  not  everyone  that  can  say  they  enjoy  their  job like  you  do.<br>  Good luck,  and don't  worry about  him,  lots more that  think  your  doing  GREAT :)|`|RvmYqQtRaa	I'd hate to be the one to tell you this but.... you wasted your time with this question since you already know you love your job. What meaningful thing can we tell you? Your life sounds great ignore the assholes.|`|V8sDPf2Eaa	only jerks look down upon you, thats good pay especially if you like your job. at least you're working and not being a mooch on welfare you should be proud. its hard to find work right now so take what you can get and good luck :)|`|qTHkBmH6aa	If you love what you're doing dnt quit!!<br>  <br>  <br>  and you're making money..<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  αм?яι￠αи ?α? я υ?? ツ ☆

Schindler's List<br>  2. Raise the Red Lantern<br>  3. Notorious (1946)<br>  4. Pulp Fiction<br>  5. The Empire Strikes Back<br>  6. Three Colors: Red<br>  7. Howard's End<br>  8. Casablanca<br>  9. Do the Right Thing<br>  10. A Hard Day's Night|`|8xabuUl6aa	My Favorite Movies<br>  1. "Leon" (Luc Besson, 1994)<br>  2. "Lolita" (Adrian Lyne, 1997)<br>  3. "Heat" (Michael Mann, 1995)<br>  4. "Cool Hand Luke" (Stuart Rosenberg, 1967)<br>  5. "Nikita" (Luc Besson, 1990)<br>  6. "The Punisher" (Jonathan Hansleigh, 2004)<br>  7. "Mad Money" (Callie Khouri, 2008)<br>  8. "Closer" (Mike Nichols, 2004)<br>  9. "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" (Milos Forman, 1975)<br>  <br>  Other great movies (In no particular ranking):<br>  North by Northwest<br>  Full Metal Jacket<br>  Pulp Fiction<br>  The Butterfly Effect<br>  Rain Man<br>  I Am Sam<br>  The Departed<br>  Scarface<br>  The Godfather Part III<br>  Hearts in Atlantis<br>  The Silence of the Lambs<br>  Taxi Driver<br>  The Fifth Element<br>  Trainspotting<br>  The Aviator<br>  Gangs of New York<br>  There Will Be Blood<br>  The Mystery of Natalie Wood<br>  <br>  "Leon" is about a hitman of the same name, who was forced to take care of the 12 yo Mathilda. The film gives an in depth look into the sexual tension in their relationship. But in the end, it becomes the greatest love story of all time in my opinion and preference.<br>  <br>  "Lolita" follows the first movie's plot closely. The difference is that the two characters got it on, if you know what i mean. But it's never disgusting, as we are given a sensual, deeply felt, and intellectual depiction of things. It ends as one of the more depressing movies in my opinion.<br>  <br>  "Heat" tells the morality battle between two men from opposite ends of the law. Each characters private lives are shown, in order to emphasize their humanity. Bias and justice are therefore avoided in the ending, giving you a strange feeling.|`|1li4vbVoaa	Any of the Halloween films including Rob Zombies Remake.|`|5lsViwoOaa	nosferatu<br>  crash<br>  american beauty|`|ozBkHxuHaa	Some Like It Hot<br>  It's A Wonderful Life<br>  Etc.
6y5wgdmHaa	If I liked you, I'd want to spend time with you, so yes.  I am an outdoor girl anyhow, so I'd definitely accept. <br>  <br>   {Even if I thought you were strange, because I CAN defend myself!}|`|IhtABUWMaa	No, I'd consider that hanging out. And sure I'd accept.|`|jeZmqhNcaa	I would go, but idk depends if theres  a kiss at the end to make it a date|`|M8f4BorPaa	no? and yes id accept|`|IgOGsKpCaa	heck yes id go! <br>  <br>  as far as calling it a date, it depends. just because a guy and girl goes out to have fun, doesnt mean its a date.<br>  <br>  i wish my friend would realize that!! (that hanging out doesnt have to be called a date! grrr)|`|tGkhYbM2aa	I wouldn't consider it a date but I would accept.|`|ekEoAVozaa	YES !<br>  <br>  So much fun :) <br>  <br>  As for the date part, it would depend on which part in the relationship you and this girl are at.|`|mKvBPA7baa	not a date but i'll consider it a hangout, and i'll hell go!|`|CTZmy8Blaa	I would go but not so much a date. Depends on the kind of girl you ask too. I would totally go though|`|l9IGytB0aa	i'd say it's just hanging.<br>  unless, they SAID it was a date.<br>  :)|`|nWZ63v0naa	I'm not a lady, so I wall call him gay|`|6BRglHwBaa	i go four wheeling with guys every summer...<br>  so no...<br>  not a date..<br>  haha just hanging out.<br>  and yeah id go.|`|AA10101702	If it's just to hang out, that's a "friend" thing and not considered a "date." And yes, I'd go. I'll load up my Grizzly and join you!|`|hFVPEkWjaa	yeah i will go
cxNLOPHNaa	Money doesn't matter, nor does the activity/activites. The attitude projected when the person issues the invitation sets the tone.<br>  <br>  Once, I was asked to "Come over for dinner and DVD" by a male friend that I had known for a few months. I had no idea he had any interest in me other than friendship. We were always just pals, hanging out. His invitation was very casual and friendly as always. And I had been to his place a few times before. When I got to his place, however... The setting, was obviously set for a romantic evening! Candles everywhere. He even had rose petals floating in the toilet, of all things! Needless to say, it was awkward. <br>  <br>  If he had shown any signs that this evening's invitation was to be "different" or given me a clue that his feelings for me were evolving/changing. I would at least have had a clue that it was to be a "date", not "another evening at my friend's house". I still would have gone. But I wouldn't have been in obvious shock. It wouldn't have made for such an awkward evening.|`|vryw9udtaa	i don't think you have to spend money to call it a date. if you go to the park, that can still be considered a date. i think it's a date if a person specifically asks another person out, even if you just go to their house to hang out.|`|eFaYMmuraa	If she can wear her trackies then its not a date! If she needs to think about what to wear then its a date!|`|ARjkM88caa	well if you love her its a date, if you like her as a friend, its a hang out|`|AA10101702	I suppose it would depend on your motive. Do you want it to be a date? Or are you making it clear to the lady that you just want some hang time?|`|grifjdr0aa	I'd rather just hang out anyway.

If i was killed by a best friend....Well i mean they had to have their reasons and i guess i'd feel more comfortable to be killed by them than a total stranger.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	Both would be a major disaster for your family. Their lives would never be the same again.|`|VoKzvoxKaa	1|`|NrkWd4Aoaa	Your answer is a bit self-centered, isn't it?|`|hXdt1lntaa	commit suicide b/c it would probably scar your family for life.|`|wnr5I8AKaa	being killed by your best friend.<br>  painfully.|`|ml2FDYECaa	The first one. The second one, you'd have to deserve what you got if it was your friend.KWIM|`|Sw0yxyueaa	I'd say the first choice is worse: blood is thicker than water and all...|`|sagb3Q7Vaa	I would really like to avoid either.|`|zTLCjUH5aa	getting killed cus thatd be my sis killing me then O_O|`|tvHM7hdDaa	Whats wrong with you?<br>  <br>  This is what's being considered entertainment? I give up on the world.|`|rBAfSiKhaa	What a morbid question!|`|0dg9JtfNaa	committing suicide in front of your family is def worse. suicide says that you have nothing to live for anymore, which is a huge insult to your family, and even more so if its in their faces. getting killed by your friend in a painful way would def suck, but it would not be your fault. so your friend would have to live with that guilt, where as with suicide, you would be the guilty party (to your family and friends).|`|Xww9vGWPaa	It depends on the route which I take to kill myself. If its something embarrassing, or if I end up with something in my butt, I will hands-down choose the other option.|`|GMvzUYbSaa	Commit suicide in front of your family.|`|PtyXfg5Aaa	Suicide in front of family...|`|ihxO8qApaa	killed by bestfriend|`|wacKJOcBaa	suicide|`|8wo2q1osaa	family.....that would so damn fucked up....please excuse my language, but seriously...|`|4dvyTFzgaa	get killed by your best friend in a painful way|`|ZJkwz1B5aa	my my, isn't someone feeling chip chip hooray this evening....lol.<br>  <br>  Family

My Favorite: Ep V: ESB.|`|ubrYk78waa	Episode IV. It was the beginning and introduced us all the the charters and the whole theme of the battle between the rebellion and the empire.<br>  Plus it was like an old shoot 'em western in the time of a galaxy far away and a long time ago. By episode V, which was a better film, we knew most of the people. But it brought up close to Yoda and a greater understanding of the force. It all went downhill from then on.<br>  Don't get me wrong. I love them all and watch them as I have them all on DVD.|`|49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	Being an old fart myself, I say Episode IV in its original form (1977).

fKcr6KU0aa	I think they've tried, several times.  If I remember correctly, Neil Gaiman ended up shooting them down after he saw the script.<br>  <br>  Yep, details here: <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandman_(Vertigo)#Film_adaptations" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandman_(Ve...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=22823" rel="nofollow">http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews...</a><br>  <br>  Neil Gaiman says in that second article that he thinks one will be made soon.  I don't think we need to worry about Keanu Reeves being cast, though.<br>  <br>  Personally: I'd like a well-done movie, but...IMHO, Sandman would work better as a TV series, if they had the budget for the special effects.  It'll never happen, but...I can dream?<br>  <br>  I do think that a "Death" movie is still in the works. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death:_The_High_Cost_of_Living#Film_adaptation" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death:_The_...</a>|`|yvOxjowkaa	Probably for the money. I won't be surprised if the star Kenau Reeves as Dream.|`|x30Pwy6eaa	I hope No.<br>  <br>  Comics are not a little brother of the Movies. <br>  These translations only pretend to appeal to a wider, and generally, dumber audience. Sandman is awesome as it is, and is worth the "effort" to read it in its original.
yxYke2y2aa	Its decent dude.<br>  Nothing overly impressive.  Typical rhyme scheme, I'd say good multis in he beginning, but its kind of too much of a slant rhyme.<br>  But real talk, not bad.

TKwO2R8Qaa	you need some sort of editing program (most people use windows movie maker cause its free and not to hard to use) then you need all the little clips saved on your comp. if you have all of that set, you just edit it all together (i'm not going to explain how to use windows movie maker, you could youtube it though)
rvtktabkaa	I don't think there is.<br>  'Yellow' is from 'Parachutes' (1999-2001)<br>  'Clocks' is from 'A rush of blood to the head' (2001-2004)<br>  and 'Viva la vida' and 'Violet hill' are from their recent album, 'Viva la vida or death and all his friends' (2006-present)<br>  <br>  :)|`|6ljZsAK3aa	no there isnt

F81T9hhxaa	useually those bundle packs are cheap guitars. But they are good for beginners. Have you looked on craigs list?|`|qigjzA77aa	well, you are a beginner, so thats a plus one for buying it  1<br>  you get what you pay for with guitars and all that looks extremely shitty so -1<br>  beginners should start off with an acoustic for finger strength -1<br>  = -1<br>  <br>  just go buy a cheap Fender or takamine acoustic trust me. you will be selling that junk on Ebay if you buy it in no time.
ainRE0abaa	because its all worn out from crazy kitty ear sex.<br>  <br>  im seriously answering for a friend.<br>  <br>  *cries*|`|RNpaBwxzaa	Probably because their ears are so sensitive and acute that thicker fur would dampen their super-sharp hearing.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh wait.

w6tKWXcFaa	Not true.<br>  For many boring reasons. <br>  But here are some 'clues' if you wish!<br>  <br>  In the song 'Lady Madonna', the lyrics state "Wednesday morning, papers didnt come"... Paul's crash was supposevly on a Wednesday, so this line could mean that his story was covered up.<br>  On the cover of Help!, He's the only one not wearing a hat, so he could have been 'decapitated'. He's also wearing a shirt that looks like a body bag.<br>  In 'Revolution#9', if you play it backwards, you can hear a car crash and someone screaming 'get him out, get him out!' and lots of crying and panic...<br>  At the end of Strawberry Fields, you can hear John say 'I buried Paul..' but he claims he said 'Cranberry Sauce..'<br>  And on the White Album, you can see a scar in Paul's lip. Billy Shears (who was his replacement, apparently) had to have lip surgery to look like Paul. However this was caused by a biking accident, I think it was, and there's a picture of Paul all cut up and dirty somewhere... :(<br>  And, Billy Shears' phone number is apparently on the MMT cover. Look carefully. Turn it upside down. It's in 'THE BEATLES.'<br>  <br>  Tons more, but you can look them up if you want. Some of them are rather silly..|`|LAhGRwU9aa	its true becuse he wasnt wearing shoes  but of course he alive and heather is rich  now, he wasnt wearing them on the cover of abey road the album

capSLZQXaa	I say Vincent Price, as Bob Morgan, from "The Last Man On Earth"(1964), as the most like the original Robert Neville.<br>   And all three movies(Last Man On Earth, Omega Man, and I am Legend) were based off of Richard Matheson's book "I Am Legend". I read the book years ago, and eventhough I prefer Price's "Bob Neville", I still feel there could be a MUCH better movie made from the original story than what has come out so far.|`|B43x5RF8aa	I agree.

And just ignore your sister. It's not like you'll be having classes with her. And I go to a big big school, and I'm doing fine. Please, take the language class!!!

However, in something like comedy it's hard to pick a 'best' as each individual person has their own kinda 'branch' of comedy and there are many people, male and female who are so funny in what they do.<br>  I would definately say that she will be around and remembered for a long time though (:

I love them. <br>  <br>  **** those preset stereos- rock, jazz, pop- they sound like **** if you ask me.<br>  <br>  I usually keep the mids at the high and equal range, some the treble and bass get turned down, but I also turn up certain bass and treble levels (not all).|`|Xwtf4iqjaa	No.|`|XcLrEdxEaa	i add more bass but not so much that others can hear it.|`|R2QgbdWUaa	no|`|PeuFnqQwaa	yes, i eq to the acoustics of the room.|`|FLqDyM32aa	I like to "feel" my music so i usually turn the bass almost all the way up and depending on the speakers turn the treble down 1 or 2 notches so you don't get a static sound when the bass kicks. (well that's how I do it in my car anyways)|`|sWvDZZ6Aaa	sometimes it just depends on what im listening to sometimes it needs to be toyed with|`|2XTNfPfmaa	my friend always turns the bass on the radio and it drives me crazy! ><<br>  i cannot stand bass, it's so nerve wracking to me!<br>  <br>  so yeah, i'd rather just keep it flat.|`|AA10482044	For tapes and records they can artificially improve your sound quite a bit but for CD's and digital they just add another noise source where you don't need, fun to play around with though!

rXMTdUg4aa	Its all a matter of opinion. You say you don't want to hear the "they sold out" excuse but people use it. People that bash bands for getting big are the people who knew who the bands were before anyone else did. Its like when you see a movie that is based on a book. The person that reads the book always says "the book was better". People that bash bands that get to popular have a chip on their shoulder. When they bash bands its their way of gloating that they new who they were back when and how "they were so much better then". They're pissed because they were cool for liking a band that not many people knew about... when the band gets big they don't have that feeling of "I'm so underground" anymore. In their eyes, anyone who likes this band now is a poser.

I HATED that job. I left one day and never came back.|`|UzXCdkMpaa	My favorite job was one where I worked four hours a day but got paid for eight. The base I was assigned to was out of space by the time my late flight came in so I was booked on a resort island in Florida. I had car service to and from work and was paid to eat my meals at restaurants. At night I bar-hopped. There was quite a club scene going on there.<br>  <br>  My worst job was a one-day job typing car titles on controlled forms with carbon paper in between the copies. Every time you screwed one up they yelled at you because they had to go through all kinds of procedures to destroy the useless forms. They would yell at you to go faster and yell at you when you screwed up! It was my first temp job, so I put up with it. After that day I got a little more demanding with my temp agency. Not all work is good work.|`|aBALRxBUaa	I worked at McDonalds for 2 yrs and left to be a garbage man. Did that for 4yrs and then became a deputy.

And I would never recommend fast food as a career path. I hated McDonalds|`|7f0ZVPt8aa	Favorite (so far): Stuffing envelopes with jewelry and adding labels to the envelopes. I was very fast at it, so I earned a lot and did overtime. <br>  <br>  Worse (so far): Machine operator in the warehouse of Chicago Sun-Times. Was only there for 3 days.

IVkGJTcuaa	Unfortunately I believe Tupac is dead.  It's been 12 1/2 years since his shooting and there have been so many tributes and public mourning for him that it seems unlikely that anyone is "in on it" if he faked it.  There are those who believe he will come back and reference the connections between the philosopher Machiavelli (who did fake his own death) and Tupac (who studied his writings while in prison).  However there are also those that believe Elvis is still alive.|`|9be089a665927db684a7527724df54c8aa	Yeah<br>  <br>  he sum where chillin with Bin Laden..

I just got off the phone with him, he's packing up to fly back from cuba with JMJ. He's crashin at my crib when he arrives in the states, but he really doesn't like visitors.|`|khU8m4gxaa	He's very dead. The whole rumor of him faking his death came because of the last CD he finished before his death being under the alias Makaveli, which is a based on Niccolo Machiavelli, who was a 16th century philosopher that is rumored to haved faked his own death, only to return 7 years later. After Pac died, there were fans who expected him to do the same. New songs kept coming because he recorded so much that hadn't been released before. He's passed away almost 13 years ago without coming back, so it's OK to accept that he is gone forever.|`|KHC2oE8iaa	man if he is its one hell of a trick he's pulling. to fake your own death like that just shows the sure genius of this man you know? the place, the timing. genius. it is mind boggling. IF it was actually orchestrated. i try not to dig into it much since the more you try to uncover, the more your left not knowing. your discoveries will only unearth more and more questions. pac is the man. missing in action or not he is the man. .|`|SIaTnM5Qaa	naw hes gone...you cant fake autopsy photos back then because photoshop wasn't all that....let him rest in peace and let him live on through his music.....|`|oJfBZ8wOaa	NO!|`|OpBFc27iaa	No.<br>  <br>  What explanation do you need? he passed away..<br>  <br>  R.I.P|`|1UKr652Uaa	Despite his continued discography and a few wacko's opinions, he is dead as a doornail.

E2VUH8Q0aa	Selfish people have existed far longer than astrology has existed. Even the ancient astrologers of Baal practiced their craft for the glory of their king, not for the knowledge. Astrologers were paid for their services even then.<br>  <br>  Trust in astrology is not an issue. It is a tool, and people who can use this tool skillfully need not be concerned with whether trust of the general populace will fade.<br>  <br>  The computer is another tool. Again, using a tool properly proves the tool. "So called astrologers" who use this as a tool are no different than traditional astrologers who use pencil and paper. Are you to castigate them for using paper instead of papyrus? <br>  <br>  If one can open one's mind to the concepts of astrology, surely opening your mind to a different tool to get to the same results should not be such a leap of faith.|`|elVDYy7eaa	Maybe "the trust on astrology" is fading because it's a load of crapola.|`|a2b8641f3900ff3887ba8bb3aa67fb65aa	*I agree with u !!<br>  Also, many a times we see that the so-called astrologer cannot predict their own ''future'' !!<br>  So how can anybody trust them ....... !!~?|`|d5c7ca66e3aab5e96442c48cd1fde13aaa	Astrology is perfect and has been used for thousands of years<br>  Astrology shall not fade<br>  It is the modern day astrologers who know less about the stars and the planets, and the messages that they convey, but know more about business and  to make quick dollars and euros, maybe they r expert in use of computer, but that does not make good astrologers.<br>  They know less about the stars, but what does it matter, they know how to convince stupid people to part with their hard earned dollars and euros, <br>  Once people become clever, the modern day astrologer with computer or without computer shall become absolete|`|94zi1LFFaa	oh please... who are you fox news? Posing your sentiment in the form of a question...  <br>  <br>  My opinion on your very personal & biased opinion would then be; Good... Let those who ~feel~ come forth & those you are stuck in their head fade back... It's all good man. I could care less if there are more or less people "into" astrology. No matter how you look at it, the world is becoming more conscious. Astrology tends to go with that awareness. That being said, astrology just helps look at the aspects & the general makeup of yourself & others. How your life unfolds & manifests is ~entirely~ up to you.<br>  <br>  ~Peace|`|FE96lTPLaa	It is true.

EStnAfF9aa	Well literally speaking no one knows why people have consistently referred to it as getting on a bus instead of in, but the lack of intrest in seeking out origin of the phrase "getting on the bus" has not caused any social conflicts or tensions in individual philosophies  perspectives. The only logical conclusion I can come to based on no research is that when you enter a bus you go up a few stairs...so technically you are "getting on" and when you exit, you go down a few stairs so you are "getting off."|`|OAuMPsynaa	Because that's the way it is and has always been, in the car but on the bus.!|`|ET3fB5G8aa	history|`|FOTgfXlAaa	because we sometimes stand on the bus, but we always sit in the car?|`|AA11121842	Uh..|`|bKo79vnBaa	Because I said so.|`|KH9bbeCNaa	coz u always feel like u went higher when u go in a bus, but a car ur always same lvl|`|04e0fa96acbc320b91b66dffc1fa2f97aa	because to get inside a car you have to bend down to avoid hitting its roof, and to get inside the bus you have to step on the step of the bus and you don't have to worry about your head too .  so in the car and on the bus.

(Haha)|`|cLW7vFUGaa	1.- How many days per week you watch anime?<br>  ~I try for every day, but usually I only get to about four days a week.<br>  <br>  2.- How many hours per day you watch anime? per week?<br>  ~I'd estimate two hours per day, eight hours per week. However, I have completed a full 26-episode series in a single weekend before. It just depends on how much free time I have.<br>  <br>  3.- Do you consider addicted to anime?<br>  ~Um, well... yes. Somewhat. Not as much as other people might be. I think I'm more addicted to the concept of anime rather than the actual viewing. For example, I believe I could survive a month or two without watching any anime, but I'd get through it by thinking about it 24/7, talking with people about shows, and doodling characters.<br>  <br>  4.- How many anime series you think you have watched?<br>  ~I keep a list! So far, thirty-five different series.<br>  <br>  5.- Have you attended any anime convention?<br>  ~Yes, a couple - the best being Anime Expo in California.<br>  <br>  6.- Have you ever used or wear a cosplay?[any character]<br>  ~Yes. (Yuki Nagato from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, if it matters.)<br>  <br>  7.- Have you purchased any anime or manga? how many approx?<br>  ~I own one anime movie on VHS, and one complete-season DVD box set of my favorite series. And if Pokémon counts as anime, then that boosts the count way up (I own every episode and movie between seasons 1 and 8), although I collected those when I thought of Pokémon as more of an American fad, before I considered myself an anime fan.<br>  And I own only two volumes of manga. I've gotten most of what I read in my local library's graphic novel section.<br>  <br>  8.- Have you purchased any ariticle related with anime?<br>  ~If that means merchandise, then yes - namely, a very pricey figurine of my favorite character.<br>  <br>  9.- Do you recommend anime to your friends?<br>  ~No, I don't push my hobby onto my friends who have no interest in it, although I may sometimes bore them rambling about it. Among my friends from anime clubs and the like who share the interest, though - yes, I share recommendations with them.<br>  <br>  10.- Have you seen any of the following anime series[ Dragon Ball[any],Bleach, Naruto, Inuyasha, Elfen Lied, Seint Seiya, Death Note]?<br>  ~Ah... sadly, no! Several of the series I've watched might be considered not part of the typical "mainstream."<br>  <br>  11.- Do you download anime espisodes evry day? how many?<br>  ~I never download episodes. I watch them streamed. Even though I know it's still not supporting the creators by watching fansubs, I'd feel like I was doing something more illegal if I actually downloaded them.<br>  <br>  12.- Do you feel the need to see anime every day?<br>  ~Yes. In fact, I want very badly to watch an episode of my current show-in-progress right now. The link is sitting on my bookmarked sites list right beside where I'm typing, but I must restrain myself and finish my homework. Not that answering questions about anime while avoiding homework is any better... (Though I'd like it to be known that, even though I say that, my grades have never suffered from my anime obsession - I'm still an A student.)<br>  <br>  So, a report about anime? That sounds very interesting. Good luck with it. ^^ I wish I could read all of your findings when you're done.<br>  <br>  By the way, I'm 15 years old; age probably helps put opinions into perspective with surveys like this.|`|BSCnjljqaa	1.

Lately, I've been watching it every day so I can finish a series (Wedding Peach). Now that I finished it, I'll pretty much stop watching it. Every Friday night, though, I HAVE to watch my new episode of Shugo Chara!! Doki.<br>  <br>  2. Yet again, it all depends. Now that I've finished Wedding Peach, I'll probably just watch one episode of Shugo Chara!! Doki every Friday. So that means that I watch 1/2 an hour of anime every day, and every week. When I was watching Wedding Peach, I watched about 10 episodes per day, so that would be about 4 hours per day, or 21 1/4 hours altogether (51 episodes, each about 25 minutes long).<br>  <br>  3. Yes. I am 15 and COMPLETELY addicted to anime. ^_^<br>  <br>  4. about 40 or more<br>  <br>  5. Sadly, no. TT_TT (One day, I will meet you, Vic Mignogna!)<br>  <br>  6. Nope. I've never had a costume. When I was younger, I really wanted to buy this one Sailor Moon costume from a certain site. It was over $100, so my parents said no. T_T<br>  <br>  7. O_O I'm even more addicted to manga than anime!!! I have EXACTLY 115 volumes of manga that I have collected (NOT including fan books and stuff like that), and I'm still going! As a matter of fact, Barnes & Noble called earlier, and my copy of Yu-Gi-Oh! Volume 5 came in! Now, I have 116!!!

XD (Well, I also have 1 "holographic" Fruits Basket poster, 2 Naruto posters [plus a book of double-sided posters that I don't have room on my wall for], a cardboard InuYasha thing that holds a collector's edition coin, and a "holographic" InuYasha Movie 4: Fire On the Mystic Island poster from when I bought the movie.)<br>  <br>  9. I WOULD, but I don't think they would like it. They make fun of me enough as it is...I wish I had more anime-obsessed friends...<br>  <br>  10. Dragon Ball (can't really remember which one; I used to watch it when I was a kid), Bleach, Naruto, InuYasha, and Death Note...to make it shorter, the ones I HAVEN'T seen are Elfen Lied and Saint Seiya.<br>  <br>  11.

Not as much right now 'cause of uni work and stuff...but probably a couple...depends on how long my breaks are and how much work I need to do.<br>  <br>  2.- How many hours per day you watch anime? per week? Same like above.<br>  <br>  3.- Do you consider addicted to anime? Define addicted. If I start a series, I really want to know what happens next, but I don't mind how long I have to wait.<br>  <br>  4.- How many anime series you think you have watched? Umm...let's see...Fruits Basket, DN Angel, Gakuen Alice, Peacemaker Kurogane, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, Cardcaptor Sakura, xxxHOLiC (Season 1), Inuyasha (Season 1, 2 and some eps from other seasons), Bleach (up to Ep 167)...7 series and parts of others.<br>  <br>  5.- Have you attended any anime convention? No<br>  <br>  6.- Have you ever used or wear a cosplay?[any character] No<br>  <br>  7.- Have you purchased any anime or manga? how many approx? Inuyasha, seasons 1 and 2<br>  <br>  8.- Have you purchased any merchandise related with anime? No...but I want a Bleach calendar. And a Captain TB plushie!<br>  <br>  9.- Do you recommend anime to your friends? No...most of my friends like it anyway<br>  <br>  10.- Have you seen any of the following anime series[ Dragon Ball[any],Bleach, Naruto, Inuyasha, Elfen Lied, Seint Seiya, Death Note]? Watching Bleach, own some of Inuyasha, seen sone Naruto on TV<br>  <br>  11.- Do you download anime espisodes evry day? how many? Not everyday...but when I do, usually just 1<br>  <br>  12.- Do you feel the need to see anime every day? No
1f23ad8a76ffc47b1c34c8170c8ab6a9aa	1. 7 days a week<br>  2. 3 or 4<br>  3. Hard to answer. Probably yes, but it depends upon how you define addiction. If you mean staying up until late in the night just to find out how something ends, then yes. But if you mean living my life according to my favourite anime character's principles, then no. If you are directly after a yes or no answer than I suppose it would be yes<br>  4. About 15-20<br>  5. Unfortunately no<br>  6. Unfortunately no<br>  7. Yes, 6 anime DVD's, 60-70 books, and borrowed more than 100<br>  8. No<br>  9. No<br>  10. Seen Bleach, Elfen Lied and part of Death Note. Death Note didn't 100% appeal to me so I never finished it<br>  11. Yes, about 2-5 a day, if you count streaming from Youtube as downloading<br>  12. Hard to answer. If an episode ends on a cliffhanger then I can't wait to see the next one and that's when I feel the need to fill the void and watch it everyday. But if most of what I'm seeing is filler episodes, I can go for weeks or months without seeing anything just so I can skip the fillers. If you are after a yes or no answer then I would have to say no, as I more often don't need to see it than I do need to.|`|Y9kjDgy8aa	1. 7 (but different anime`s)<br>  2. 1 hour ( But again different anime`s)<br>  3.

CoRGsuN3aa	I love that song! By Simple Plan right? Isn't it called "Perfect"? It is sad.|`|S9bEtVCSaa	Sorry hon, not a Simple Plan fan.
AA11963397	i totally agree, ur there to watch the movie, not to hear beeps and see screens lighting up..|`|hafFbjm8aa	Yes it is very annoying. I don't like it either. but there was this one time where my friend thought she was pregnant and she was a nervous wreck. I had to say someting to her. and at the same time, by best friends ex boyfriend decided that he wanted me to be his girlfriend, but I wasn't interested, so I tried to chase him off. Then my other best friend texted me, and she said that she liked this guy, and so I tried to set them up 1) because they would be a good couple, and 2) maybe he would leave me alone. then the guy i liked started texting me. I finally just left the movie.<br>  <br>  it's annoying, but you never know what they could be texting about. like, I know that's just my boring life, but at the time, it seemed pretty important. <br>  <br>  someone could be breaking up with their boyfriend, or news that their brother just died or something like that. I usually try to give those people some slack. I honesty don't know, but yeah, I hate it.<br>  oh, just a little fyi. Texting doesn't clog up the phone lines...<br>  <br>  EDIT: i am sorry, but I pay my own cell phone bill. I pay for the minutes, and the texting, so dont you DARE say that I don't care about anything like lighting up the movie theatre. I tried to hide it the best I could. and, also, I paid for that blackberry with my own money. and by the way, I DID LEAVE THE MOVIE!!!!!|`|3af30c08175e2bc96bcd85540e09d175aa	I just got an idea. Maybe we should bring mini keychain flashlights to movies. Then when some dipshit has been texting, later when they are watching the movie we can shine it into their eyes for a couple minutes. I mean, who wants to just sit through a movie?<br>  <br>  If you have a real emergency, you shouldn't be texting. That's the slowest way to communicate, and only should be used in a REAL widespread emergency (like an earthquake) to check on relatives without clogging up phone lines. If you are freaking out about a pregnancy scare, or breaking up with your boyfriend, you aren't going to be able to enjoy the movie anyway so you might as well go outside so you can talk on the phone in privacy. And if you are really SO BUSY with parties that you don't have time to sit through a movie, why are you wasting your time and money in a movie theater?|`|rKSs8Wejaa	you know what girl if you dont like it well go to a difrent movie us teens care about things other than just sit there and watch the movie what do you rather us do talk. ok i know talking is disrespectful but exting come on your like some girl who wants everything for herslef just get a life and if you dont like how us teens behave in the movie theater well just simply buy the movie and watch it at home were no1 disturbes you!|`|5lsViwoOaa	i agree i dont even take my phone in with me i hate sitting near anyone who even seems slightly handicapped in the manner department. i would rather sit next to a stinky old guy who farts alot just cause i know he dont mean it. movie texters need to be tought a lesson|`|ml2FDYECaa	Next time grab it, toss it, and say you don't know who it was...they ran off. It is dark, and you can say it wasn't you.|`|nd139XdDaa	Simple fact is that texting allows ppl who are not in the movie with them to still stay intouch with their friends. Maybe there is a party after the movie, so they text every1 let em know quickly and be prepared. Maybe sum gossip is going around. I do understand your pain, but really, society today is ruled by text-messages and cell phones. think this way...better then them talking on it lol

Their lives and fates are guided by strange jewels that contain the spirits and destinies of warriors from the Sangokushi period. One girl, Sonsaku Hakufu, has recently moved to Japan and is apparently destined to unite the schools as her counterpart united seven countries long ago. But, like all heroes, there is a darker side to her fate, and as always there is a constant struggle by those around her to break the chains of their own destinies and make their own lives.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.zomganime.com/anime/ikkitousen/" rel="nofollow">http://www.zomganime.com/anime/ikkitouse...</a>|`|clPvtugSaa	Maybe you can go to <a href="http://www.mangafox.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mangafox.com</a> and try your luck.

uD1S5dYtaa	They would have the same general aspects, esp. the "heavy" or slow moving planets.  You are correct that the Moon amd the rising sign may change.  The faster planets such as Mercury, Venus, or Mars may also change.  But remember if the rising changes then all the houses will too. And if a planet moves even one minute it could move it into or out of orb of an aspect. It doesn't seem like much, but it could work out to be significant.

2EE9L1Q7aa	Don't know about Fred Savage being a child molester. But, he did play a rapist on Law and Order: SVU. And He play a abusive murdering boyfriend on one of those Lifetime movies. So I guess your friend is getting make believe mixed up with reality.|`|AA10652430	Your friend may be off...|`|WyxxDgSeaa	Well, that wins the prize as the craziest thing I've heard today. I've never heard anything negative about Savage, period. If your friend says he's "registered and everything," have him/her show you exactly where. It would be public information. That's a particularly nasty rumor and I hope Savage doesn't hear about it.|`|A1DgICqCaa	your friend is real stupid he has never ever been a child molester <br>  <br>  Spouse<br>  Jennifer Lynn Stone  (7 August 2004 - present) 2 children<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ??dbd??|`|v8lSuNQzaa	I think your friend is very confused.

YT9vgUNbaa	I think I figured out what you're asking. You lack commas.<br>  <br>  Do you mean: What do the Latins feel when they speak Spanish and nobody understands them?<br>  <br>  If such is the case, I have no idea. I'm not Latin.|`|VfbsGjYSaa	Are you speaking English? Because I can't understand YOU!|`|niGAKJT4aa	how do you feel, the questions, when by the asking of they are not comprehensible as such?|`|9Kax4Kekaa	I'm not sure exactly what you mean.  If you mean what do people feel when nobody understands your language, then ok.  I lived in Mexico for 8 years and at first knew no Spanish at all.  It's very boring and frustrating, not so much that no one understands you but that you don't understand anything or anyone.  <br>  <br>  If that's not what you meant then revise your question because its a bit fragmented.|`|xs0nvLOwaa	You make no sense. First learn to state your question correctly, then come back and ask the question.

However I believe those who think life is hell will think life after death is hell too.<br>  <br>  Why?  In my opinion this is the most logical answer.

But I think that Fifteen and White Horse do a much better job of showcasing her talent for writing songs of poignancy and power. Especially on a line such as the one in White Horse where she sings about that in love she didn't know you had to fight to have the upper hand. That's a pretty powerful piece of wisdom for someone as young as her to be able to express clearly and effectively in her writing. Then there is the issue of Fifteen where she nails the awkward feelings of being young and vulnerable to anything that comes around. I don't know about any body else but I get a tingle in the base of my spine when I hear her sing that line from fifteen about how when you are that age and somebody tells you they love you you're going to believe them and about how it's the age before you know what it is that you are supposed to be. She's writing the songs of youth that I don't think popular music has really seen since early Bruce Springsteen or John Mellencamp.|`|Ec8grcIraa	Love Story is my favorite and i don't really even like country!It's just a good song.

We even had signs up in the lobby warning that this section of the building is closed for renovation. Some women just totally ignored the sign and ducked under the caution tape and walked through our area anyways. So we put a bucket in the lobby and fashioned a toilet seat out of ceiling tile for on it. We put a sign on it saying,"temporary ladies room".|`|At8D5Xu2aa	In college, some friends decided to give a "hotfoot" to every member of a sorority during a single semester.

f639092fc925bbd55e7b6272eeb17334aa	His escape pod sunk in the water but he was able to find the ship he had escaped from.<br>  <br>  The monkey(s) on the ship had been effected by the cosmic forces that sent him into a time warp.<br>  <br>  The smartest monkey from the ship was still alive and rescued him from the ape army.<br>  <br>  He takes the ship back in time hoping that if he reverses what he did before he would return to the world he once knew but returning in time he found that it was too little to late as the Earth was a planet ruled but monkeys.<br>  <br>  The thought is that the ship had traveled back to earth at the correct time and the cosmic forces altered the planet. the monkey had been in hibernation for centuries before the man found him and going back in time was not enough. The fact is that even if the final scene was not there the logical implication should be that the ship landing on earth will start the change again. The director was simply trying to let the audience figure it out that you can not go back in time to change the outcome of things that effect your reason for going back in time, else you never make the trip.|`|AA11640951	First off, don't waste your time.  If you want to watch Planet of the Apes, do so with the original 1968 version and it's four sequels.  <br>  <br>  In answer to you question, Mark Wahlberg returns to Earth near the Lincoln Memorial and finds the statue now represents the chimpanzee Thade, the major villain of the film. It makes little sense and is in no way near the power of the original Statue of Liberty.  <br>  <br>  The ship (Oberon) Wahberg works on carries animals as well as humans.  They all end up going back in time AT DIFFERENT TIMES, so the big ship in the desert is the 'mother ship" which crashed and apparently was the cause of the apes ruling the planet, while Mark  is in a pod that crashes in a lake sometime later.  The chimp Pericles pilots down even later and comes off as a god or whatever.|`|QmOmbprOaa	HE REALIZES THE APES HAVE TAKEN OVER.HAD IT BEEN ME I WOULD HAVE KILLED OFF THE APES WITH A SUBMACHINE GUN. APES TEND TO MISMANGE THE STOCK MARKET.|`|4x2KMVbBaa	Turns out when he goes back to Earth, our world has been taken over by apes or maybe it always was, because Abe Lincoln's statue in D.C. is an ape! Very creepy ending.

d02c709e184c7a1f7828d9e3e00c32b4aa	I feel guilty for never having heard of this band.  Wow, that's great stuff.  No matter what I do the rest of the day, it can now be chalked up as a massive success since I discovered another new group (at least new in my world too, I see they've been around a while).  I certainly enjoyed me some Daddy's Little C**t.  Good work, Persephone!|`|pLPKo6mBaa	It sounded familiar and then that's when I realized I was remembering the band Cycle Sl*ts From Hell.

Catchy stuff.|`|srtoPxN2aa	Not normally my cup of tea, but I did enjoy Daddy's Little C**t...sort of like a three way between Ministry, Skrew, and Malhavoc...with a sexually aroused Marilyn Manson attempting to join in on the fun via the back door. <br>  Definitely nothing new happening there, but still pretty cool. Thanks for posting!|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	Listening to them Edit<br>  <br>  Sleaze Rock meets Industrial<br>  <br>  minus the shock rock.<br>  <br>  another view.

The site is called <a href="http://ch131.com." rel="nofollow">http://ch131.com.</a> I will post some sites to watch heroes in a while.

Zodiac signs have nothing to do with people's relationships.|`|jTkzSyzbaa	well im a pisces and i make really good friend with sag. we always have never ending convos and enjoy being with each other, both male and female sag :).|`|yMfJNatnaa	I know this is not what you want to hear but.......Gemini is the complementary opposite sign to Sagittarius. Although the relationship between the two may have some difficulties, Sagittarius can learn from Gemini how to notice and take account of details. In this way, Sagittarius can become inspiring guides, lighting the way for others, rather than leading them by preaching what the route should be.|`|1QKYkISEaa	no sign can be negative or positive. every sign has its own character, but a person cab be negative or positive. ie if amitabh bacchan is a libra, can all Libras be amitabh or mohandas karamchand gandhi?<br>  <br>  u have to be true in a friendship first to get a positive Response....|`|iJRcdSbiaa	Leo and Aries are our best matches.  Relationships with anyone regardless of signs is possible.  Go with your heart.|`|9MRSjkkxaa	aries. <br>  very good together.

AA10197672	Scorpios eyes are known to be Intense, mysterious, magnetic that have drawing power. Also, if Scorpio wants something or someone bad enough - then Scorpio can often think the desired the object into existence with the force of sheer will power!...|`|jTkzSyzbaa	their eyes speak. whenever i look at their eyes there are always something underneath that's awaiting to explode. many people who dont care wont notice this, but me a pisces who likes to read others' emotions and motives.|`|jcL7gDMKaa	LOL that's true!

nxHjSKTTaa	I am a scorp and my ex is an asshole oh, I mean Aries.  Yea, this is NOT a good combination!  Your both way two stubborn.  Aries are very self centered and dominating.  You will not be happy in the end.  Just thought I should warn you!<br>  <br>  You don't seduce them, they MUST chase you!  Just incase you do not take heed to my previous warning.  My ex asked me out 3 times before I finally agreed to go out with him.  I loved the persistence and confidence in him. <br>   <br>  Be a lady, never pursue a guy.  Also, never date an Aries.|`|plBXp91Daa	Just be yourself  and it isn't bad if you play a little bit hard to get.|`|9XR3wqtcaa	Shouldn't be too hard, seeing as how most of them are willing to f*** anything that walks...but they do like the thrill of the chase. Like a few other people before me have said, play hard to get. It drives them crazy. Ah but I wouldn't recommend getting involved with an Aries, unless you want your heart broken. I know from experience.|`|3EQsrBxCaa	oh they don't need seduced, honey.  just ask em!  aries men don't need a lot of convincing.|`|p3NW0Mstaa	Arrive naked, works with any man any sign..

It is meant for eating the top...then I save the crust for when I am starving and add things to the top of it ....mind you I MUST be starving....and I do NOT care for fried foods unless they are breaded with pankow crumbs....fried food is confusing to me...all that work while broiling it or a quick sstir frywould do fine....however if it is a toss up between either one of those I would sooner be in a duel for true culinary pleasure and yes would stake my life.....neither. This will not garner a BA however it wil save my arteries ~ Duel at Dawn dear Laro...and then  a feast at a 5 star restaurant....I do NOT lose.<br>  <br>  Eternally Ungelatinously Yours<br>  <br>  Garbo|`|k7FD3rt5aa	Cold pizza!!|`|1hiImyBdaa	Cold fried chicken.|`|m1JyB08Raa	cold pizza.|`|AA10026476	I like them when it's cold.|`|5l2kTANaaa	Cold fried chicken. add some really hot sauce and it won't feel so cold anymore :-)|`|n8BALQRiaa	cold pizza|`|bI3areCsaa	Cold fried chicken.|`|ohHEQimxaa	cold pizza.|`|N1mU99S1aa	chicken.  my dad and brother eat cold pizza in the AM.|`|AA11111233	Cold fried chicken for lunch

She was pushing me on the swing when she heard a car honk. Thinking they were honking at her, she looked up to see who it was. When she looked back to me, i was flat on the ground with my arms and legs all spread out. I got up and the mulch was sticking to my face. My mom said it was the funniest thing she ever saw, because i was so stunned and i didn't really know what had happened. She started laughing EXTREMELY loud. There were all of these "perfect mommies" around her that were looking at her like she was the meanest mother in the entire world.<br>  <br>  So that is my story!<br>  <br>  Oh also i laugh really weird, so when i start laughing, I just start laughing even harder because it is so hilarious sounding.

Mikami consistantly fills the Death Note with page after page of criminals, yet it never appears thicker...<br>  <br>  I guess that's just one thing people don't usually question. Maybe some of the older pages just start disappearing on their own to save room.

3788e558db37b44f3577186d780dfdd6aa	Harry Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts turns out to be quite the exciting year. First off is the arrival of a new teacher at Hogwarts, Horace Slughorn, who is a bit more useful to Harry than he realizes. Next, Harry obtains a Potions book which used to be belong to the very mysterious Half-Blood Prince. Harry finds that the Half-Blood Prince's ancient scribbles are written along the margins of almost every page, giving Harry advice on how to improve greatly on his Potions work, and also teaching him a few helpful (and dangerous) spells along the way.<br>  <br>  Amidst this, Harry is starting private lessons with Professor Dumbledore, during which Harry learns the dark secrets of Voldemort's past, hoping that they could use these secrets to find a way to defeat him.<br>  <br>  Harry's year gets even more stressful with the suspicious actions of Draco Malfoy, who has been sneaking around the school doing, so Harry assumes, Voldemort's bidding. Harry quickly becomes determined, and slightly obsessed, to find out exactly what Malfoy has been up to and putting and end to it.<br>  <br>  Yet, during this time, Harry and his friends go through daily life, busy with school work, Quidditch, (in which Harry has been made captain of the team) and of course, romance. Ron has found a new girlfriend, Lavender Brown, a perky (if not obnoxious) Gryffindor student, and Hermione is not happy about it. Ron and Hermione's friendship takes a toll throughout the school year and Harry, as usual, is stuck in the middle. Harry, meanwhile, is facing a romantic dilemma of his own: he realizes he is falling for his best friend's sister, Ginny Weasley, who is unfortunately dating Harry's classmate, Dean Thomas. Harry's pining for Ginny and Ron's hilarious relationship with Lavender give this story a large dose of reality.<br>  <br>  Throughout all the school drama, however, the obvious darkness of Voldemort's impending rise to power is always apparent. The incredible action-packed climax is sure to leave the audience stunned and, inevitably, prove that you shouldn't trust everybody who you think is good and also prove that not everyone can manage to survive.|`|RD0yaJlgaa	It's about the mysterious Half-Blood Prince whom Harry discovers in his sixth year at Hogwarts because of a book (Advance Potion Making) and Voldemort's past which Harry finds out with Dumbledore's help using the pensieve. Harry meets Slughorn, his new potion teacher and Snape becomes Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Death eaters are more stronger and dangerous that they attack even the muggle community. Relationships between Harry-Ginny and Ron-Lavender will develop and Harry and Dumbledore's quest for destroying the horcrux.<br>  And last, one of the main characters will die at the end<br>  <br>  yah Dumbledore. Somebody already said it|`|Glk38Ml3aa	Basically Dumbledore dies..
AA12024265	I hate those shows!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I *O*N*L*Y* Watch Adult Swim's Dubbed Animes.<br>  <br>  More importantly, 'Bleach' !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|TkbqAKcOaa	Yes, I think it's a bit strange when sober. Some of the anime they've had on there in the past was reeeeally good, though, even sober. Full Metal Alchemist, for instance, was amazing.|`|AA11126297	Yeah it's a little too weird for me most of the time. So, I haven't watched it for a while. I do occasionally like to watch Family Guy or Home Movies, though...those two aren't scary trippy.|`|niGAKJT4aa	i love athf and they used to show sealab 2021 and that show was hi-larious.  frisky dingo is acceptable and the venture bros are good too.  but the other programming has really gone downhill over the past couple of years.  the xavier show doesn't even make any sense, not the video or the dialog.|`|oECHtfYUaa	i agree, those shows are super weird...and i cannot figure out why king of the hill is on adultswim when it came on regular prime time tv. i guess those shows continue where ren & stimpy and beavis and butthead left off......|`|NQz0jpcfaa	You know bro i have to admit you absolutely right. I missed the old days and im only 13 lol|`|E14DHZsUaa	Some of the shows are great, i.e. king of the hill, family guy, robot chicken and the boondocks. But as of late they have gone completely insane. tim & eric is the worst show ever to be broadcast on tv. and delocated is absolutely horrific. the renegade angel show is so bad that sometimes i think adult swim has lost its mind|`|scGOVg8saa	Yeah, I guess the people who pick out the shows need new people to do their job.

So no, not gonna happen|`|QLotskOJaa	no way that he can play batman ... cristians is just into that batman stuff !
dh48AkbCaa	he told jeanne what he thought she needed to hear.<br>  <br>  he did love her, but he had to let her go to get on with her life.<br>  <br>  in judgement day part one, it seemed as if jenny actually did kill la grenouille, as gibbs was matching the bullets before he tried to call her just after she died.<br>  <br>  trent kort also claimes he did it.|`|A03NJA26aa	O.k, Tony was undercover dating Jeanne who is la grenouille's daughter.  So he had to be with her but he couldn't really fall in love with her which she did so that's why she asked if it was real. Either Jenny killed La grenouille or he killed himself, they never really said and we just had to guess.

XM41P9Tbaa	Well I just got done watching a movie called The Duchess. It was a really good movie it is set back into the 1700's in England and it was based on a true story about a the Duchess on Devonshire but this movie is very complicated to explain but it is not just a chick flick my brother actually watched it and he is 22 and liked it. But if you would like a more manly movie LOL then Valkyriethe new Tom Cruise movie was excellent. A few other that are good are The Dark Night Iron Man, Mall Cop was funny, Yes Man Jim Carey movie, The Curious Case of BeBenjaminutton was really good. Hope this helps you out.|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	Define "good movie." One man's "good movie" is another man's "worst movie I ever saw."

"Leon" (Luc Besson, 1994)<br>  2. "Lolita" (Adrian Lyne, 1997)<br>  3. "Heat" (Michael Mann, 1995)<br>  4. "Cool Hand Luke" (Stuart Rosenberg, 1967)<br>  5. "Nikita" (Luc Besson, 1990)<br>  6. "The Punisher" (Jonathan Hansleigh, 2004)<br>  7. "Mad Money" (Callie Khouri, 2008)<br>  8. "Closer" (Mike Nichols, 2004)<br>  9. "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" (Milos Forman, 1975)<br>  <br>  Other great movies (In no particular ranking):<br>  North by Northwest<br>  Full Metal Jacket<br>  Pulp Fiction<br>  The Butterfly Effect<br>  Rain Man<br>  I Am Sam<br>  The Departed<br>  Scarface<br>  The Godfather Part III<br>  Hearts in Atlantis<br>  The Silence of the Lambs<br>  Taxi Driver<br>  The Fifth Element<br>  Trainspotting<br>  The Aviator<br>  Gangs of New York<br>  There Will Be Blood<br>  The Mystery of Natalie Wood<br>  <br>  "Leon" is about a hitman of the same name, who was forced to take care of the 12 yo Mathilda. The film gives an in depth look into the sexual tension in their relationship. But in the end, it becomes the greatest love story of all time in my opinion and preference.<br>  <br>  "Lolita" follows the first movie's plot closely. The difference is that the two characters got it on, if you know what i mean. But it's never disgusting, as we are given a sensual, deeply felt, and intellectual depiction of things. It ends as one of the more depressing movies in my opinion.<br>  <br>  "Heat" tells the morality battle between two men from opposite ends of the law. Each characters private lives are shown, in order to emphasize their humanity. Bias and justice are therefore avoided in the ending, giving you a strange feeling.|`|LYnrj01faa	if you havent seen it already. 'Fearless' is an awesome movie. Kung Fu movie, inspirational. In chinese though so if your still going to watch it get some subtitles with the dvd if you u dont understand chinese. enjoy.

yS61H04haa	They did one good album and them they began to suck. Personally, I love Amy Lee's voice. I wish they would actually do Gothic rock. The potential is there. There are too many bands that are better than them. <br>  <br>  <br>  For me it has nothing to do with their being american. I have no bias. In face I think the majority of the bands I am into are american.<br>  <br>  <br>  I just ******* hate unrealized potential!|`|8tGE36z9aa	Evanescence is my favorite band and I can't help but correct you on a couple of things:<br>  <br>  They're not a Christian band(Amy Lee said so herself)<br>  The song is called "Bring Me to Life", not "Wake Me Up Inside"|`|nEn6EPuqaa	its not because theyre Christian... a really really popular metal/screamo band is The Devil Wears Prada and theyre christian.<br>       the emo kids love em for some reason.|`|7d3a7f37638a599f44ec8ae98fa6fbedaa	I really like Evenescence. Usually I don't base my opinion of a band from their looks (Green Day-I like they band, dont like his front teeth). I just like the way they make music and express their emotions|`|u18GBKmiaa	I love Evanescence lol i don't really care if anyone else don't like them.|`|ObeBvtzgaa	Eh I just don't really like them from what I've heard (which isn't that much, but a song or two). I don't hate them. I just didn't care for their sound, I didn't even know they were American (I'm American too) or Christian, but I don't have a problem with them being either of those anyway.

0bff81ed3d62dee95cf8cc2a3daa55a4aa	We're only halfway through choosing the final 12 - there's still the third group of 12 semi-finalists, plus the Wild Card group to be brought back by the judges.  Right now, my favorites are Adam Lambert and Allison Iraheta, but I think all the choices of the voters are potential winners.  It's too bad that with the change in format, someone wasn't appointed to help each contestant choose a suitable song for the competitions.  That's been the biggest complaint of all the judges, and I must agree with them.  I would also like to see nut jobs like Nick Mitchell and Tatiana del Toro eliminated during auditions, instead of foisting their annoying performances and/or behaviors on the public.  I had to laugh at Simon Cowell's claim that his own behavior is a result of self-confidence - not so!  It's the result of arrogance.|`|9XjtEdEqaa	my two favorites are danny gokey and adam lambert. i like adam more because of his uniqueness and his range is amazing. go to youtube and search adam lambert and some more of his previous performances are on there which makes me love him even more.|`|Vl9jNPJNaa	If i had to pick a winner from the 6 finalist, i would go for Danny Gokey because he is likable and his vocal seems unique for the show..

uD1S5dYtaa	You were born when you were supposed to be born.  You planned it all out before you were born when you chose your astrological chart.  You chose your parents and the situations of your life so you could learn how to deal with them and develop your soul.***If your "feelings" are different, its not because of the difference in signs from when you were supposed to be born, or from being on the cusp, there are 9 other planets and a rising sign and the signs on the houses that influence how you feel and how you project yourself.  If you really want to know yourself, a natal chart is necessary.|`|sCnksozaaa	well, i was 2 months premature, I was supposed to be born november 7th but was born september 22nd   Im on the cusp of virgo and libra but im more of a virgo.

94b09dc893fe23fd5d972ad2cf5381aaaa	The moon is emotional, subconscious, instincts. Others see sun, you see moon in yourself.<br>  <br>  Moon in Scorpio is extreme emotions. Feelings motivate actions. Moon Scorpios hide their feelings and deny them even to themselves as they are ashamed of them. Remember wrongs done to you by others and good memory. Very hard to ever completely trust in love and a long time before completely committed. Cannot stand being emotionally vulnerable and raw, especially publicly. More obstacles than other moon positions. Judgmental and observing. Needs great emotional security. Sensual. Attracts opposite sex. Many marry more than once.<br>  <br>  House placement of moon shows where and how it affects.<br>  <br>  Moon placed in...<br>  House 1: Scorpio emotion is identified as self.<br>  House 2: what you own. <br>  House 3: Shows through communication.<br>  House 4: Family and home.<br>  House 5: Pleasure and love. -May have a child that becomes famous. (That's me! =) yay. likely too as my kid has Leo rising/moon and Aqua sun) (only as moon house placement, not specifically scorpion)-<br>             6: Service and health. (Emotions dictating this)<br>             7: Marriage and partnership. (Empathy to those with this placement in Scorpion Moon) lol. placement indicates possible divorce -general, not specifically scorpio.<br>             8: Death/Afterlife, Spiritual. Could suffer loss of mother or wife.<br>             9: mental, philisophical.<br>             10: career. <br>             11: Hopes & Friends. <br>             12: Others. Sorrows.|`|uscHnFPtaa	SCORPIO: acts intensely, passionately, and secretly. It is poison and it's cure, bitter emotions and passionate intensity's, treason, death, and Resurrection. It indicates what is hidden and the end of things, as well as the mystery of illumination.

At the $300 price range, the Fender Squier is still your best option. Fenders are extremely reliable, but the Squier range isn't quite as good.<br>  <br>  If you want better than that, you should probably check out the Ibanez range. They make brilliant rock basses. And there is always the mainstream fender range too, which are still good for basses. (There also Fender Jaguar basses, which also look completely awesome).<br>  <br>  Jaguar Bass: <a href="http://www.dolphinmusic.co.uk/shop_image/product/4d4ed10a585374d199d99a24c427fe91.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.dolphinmusic.co.uk/shop_image...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You might want to check out your local music store too, just to see what you like.

21R4oEXFaa	Helen Keller (June 27, 1880 – June 1, 1968) was an American author, political activist and lecturer. She was the first deafblind person to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree.[1][2] The story of how Keller's teacher, Annie Sullivan, broke through the isolation imposed by a near complete lack of language, allowing the girl to blossom as she learned to communicate, has become known worldwide through the dramatic depictions of the play and film The Miracle Worker.<br>  <br>  A prolific author, Keller was well traveled and was outspoken in her opposition to war. She campaigned for women's suffrage, workers' rights, and socialism, as well as many other progressive causes.<br>  <br>  <br>  Why 3OH!3 sings about them; I have no clue..a lot of artist simular to them sing about her.<br>  <br>  :)|`|quIDrXktaa	Helen Keller became deaf and blind before her second birthday late in the 19th century.

I would stick to my own side of the elevator, because I would have one, take a seat in the corner away from the door and read one of the novels or manga I was carrying in my bag.<br>  <br>  If one of them asks me something I'd answer, I'm far from rude when it comes to strangers, but I have no interest in conversation. I don't talk much. I'd be as vague as I possibly can, while maintaining my politness, and try to make them realize that I don't want to talk to them. They can find a way to occupy themselves and each other. Leave me out of it. <br>  <br>  Eventually I can see myself becoming irritated because it's taking too long for the damn elevator to be repaired, lol.|`|J7EWQHYJaa	Uhh no bodyguards? Elevator?

2wgEsVmsaa	Ouch! Who the heck wears hard-healed slippers. Ow!<br>  <br>  Question 1. If you woke up and suddenly you were in your least favourite manga or anime, what would you do?<br>  >My answer: Make the best of it... at least it's anime/manga ^_^<br>  <br>  I'd say, "Hey, let's do something to liven this dead place up!"<br>  <br>  Question 2. How would you most like to die in anime or manga? (Immortality not an option)<br>  >My answer: Probably as collateral damage when Sesshomaru destroys something<br>  <br>  Honest. I'd just like to really die. Not come back. Not be reincarnated. Just die, have the cast weep, and the series move on.<br>  <br>  Question 3. You're suddenly being stalked by your least favourite anime/manga character. What do you do?<br>  A) Kill them!<br>  B) Stalk them back!<br>  C) Submit!<br>  D) Hit them over the head with an umbrella!<br>  E) Other (please state)<br>  <br>  E.) Other. Brain them with this danged old slipper!<br>  <br>  Question 4. Imagine you wake up in Animeland, however you don't speak Japanese so you don't understand anything. Your least favourite character is the only one who speaks your language. What do you do?<br>  A) You don't care... so you go get them and have them translate for you.<br>  B) You try to teach someone else your language.<br>  C) You don't have a translator.<br>  D) You go back home.<br>  E) Other (please state)<br>  <br>  I would become a martial Japanese-speaking student. Hai!<br>  <br>  Anyway, that is the end of anime survey 2.0.... stay tuned for more surveys XP<br>  <br>  Okay! Can't wait! Buy some soft things!|`|cJZL83pLaa	Hmm.. cool.<br>  <br>  1) The worst anime is "Death Note". It's has such a serious atmosphere and the guy gets all worked up over a notebook.... I seriously don't know what i'd do if I were in there. I don't want a death note nor do I want to be friends with Light. The only smile characters give are sinister ones and it's always dark. I think I'd kill myself whilst hoping that I'd fall into some other anime/manga/manhwa like Furuba! or VAMPIRE KNIGHT OMG!<br>  <br>  2) If I was in some adventure/fighting manga, I'd die while protecting others. Hey..at least my awesome fighting skills are shown off. If I was in a romance manga, I'd want to die with my love. In addition to that, if it was some fantasy-romance manga, while dying it'd be like we dissolve into sakura blossoms and float up to heaven! XD Kind of like how Freedert and Elliot "officially" died in D.N. Angel. That was beautiful! >_<<br>  <br>  And if I were in Vampire Knight, I wonder if it'd be really painful having my beloved vampire suck my blood. (No. I'm not emo. In fact, I'm the opposite.)<br>  <br>  3) E- Run over to them with my super fast speed, lock my arm around their neck and whisper in their ear, "I guess you don't cherish you life..."  (Would never do that in real life..)<br>  <br>  4) A- I'd get them to translate for me. I don't have time to be teaching other people my language and looking for others.<br>  <br>  Wow.... that was one of the first times that my imagination was full blown. I had a brain blast there. Make more anime surveys!<br>  <br>  P.S. Love vampire knight! Do one on that!|`|sb3PV5seaa	Question 1.

In my dream, two people were having an intense conversation in a meadow in the woods. One of these people was just your average girl. The other person was fantastically beautiful, sparkly, and a vampire. They were discussing the difficulties inherent in the facts that A) they were falling in love with each other while B) the vampire was particularly attracted to the scent of her blood, and was having a difficult time restraining himself from killing her immediately. For what is essentially a transcript of my dream, please see Chapter 13 ("Confessions") of the book.<br>  <br>  <br>  Here is the website: <a href="http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/twilight.h..." rel="nofollow">http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/twilight.h...</a><br>  <br>  And yes, I do believe vampires exist.

However if you are meaning the chicken egg or chicken then the chicken egg must have come first because a chicken must have come from a chicken egg.

ryLbKatoaa	It's a game for the PS2. Hisui no Shizuku: Hiiro no Kakera 2<br>  <br>  It's hard to find out more about this game. I don't think it's available in English... But that's the art to a drama CD.<br>  <br>  Edit: Okay, who's thumbing me down...? The answer's right! The Japanese CLEARLY says, in katakana, "Hisui no Shizuki" on the right side. The kanji on the left side (which I can read, but I have clues) have a "no" separating them, like "Hiiro NO Kakera" and ends in a 2. The bottom of the main kanji says "Dorama CD", which means "Drama CD". Google has proven that it's a video game and I can find no information on it being either an anime or a manga.

The real cheap ones, under $200 are good to learn on and that it. Check the rest of the site www.musicianfriend.com for other cheaper ones if you wish. I play an Ibanez SR800 and a Schecter Stiletto Custom 5.

g8QMrSzwaa	pregooooo<br>  get a self test done
pPxEhKnaaa	YES! That is exactly what they like..... They treat you like crap, until you pay them no mind, as soon as you leave them alone, they come after you.... they love to play mind games, say things for certain reactions...|`|GTUUy3ccaa	I'm a pisces and I don't like to chase anyone. I am way too sensitive to go after someone only for them to choose someone else in the end. We don't like feeling like we won't achieve or we will leave it alone. However, you can still make it interesting. Instead making me chase you, why not just leave me alone unless you really want to give me a chance.|`|oDdXpghDaa	A little bit, but to be honest the game gets really old, really fast - and the Pisces boy will finally say "screw it" after a short while.  We don't really like to feel like we're being led on, and the chase makes us think you don't know what the heck you want.<br>  <br>  We're emotional sponges, so whatever you're feeling he's going to pick up on that and feel it too.  So don't seem TOOOO anxious to keep the chase going or he'll feel like he doesn't have a chance with you.  Pisces tend to date down because they feel like they can't get anything better on their own.<br>  <br>  Frankly, we'd rather just get down to the business of cuddling you, romanticising you, and daydreaming about how perfect our life with you could be...|`|BxVGLhheaa	yes they do like the chase
VD4NQMLLaa	Long time ago. But I heard the phrase 'When life throws you lemons make lemonade'. I learned about my self esteem and how low I had it. I learned not to feel sorry about myself. I began to read motivational books. It helped me a lot. Now I don't feel that bad. School was a problem for me. To much peer pressure and bad influence. That past is gone. The future looks bright.<br>  <br>  Now your gf left you. You are hurt and in pain. That doesn't means you're a looser. Snap it out of it. If it was because something you did apologize. And tell her you are going to change and don't want to loose her. And to give you a second chance. After that is up to her.<br>  <br>  And remember, sometimes relations just end. That's a reality. One gets tired of the other and that's it. And nothing you do will change that. Good luck.|`|HQ1t2ayLaa	Oh yeah|`|V8sDPf2Eaa	i do sometimes but it motivates me to do better|`|qy07K2k5aa	Yeah, I sometimes feel like that, but for different reasons with you.|`|vPvRZBqGaa	Ohhh.

I had this girlfriend and I didn't love her like you loved your ex but she would just flirt and flirt with different guys, I couldn't stop it! The VERY day we broke up she was with a different guy and for some reason it just ticked me off even though I didn't feel great affection for her. I can't imagine the **** you're goin' through since you cared about her...<br>  <br>  I'm sorry bro, I hate to tell you this, but time heals all... I didn't believe it, but it is in fact true.|`|85YtzzKraa	Yes! Well today I sat alone at lunch! And I basically held a conversation with myself for the entire 30 minutes!

Almost all of his earlier work falls under that category, from Wu-Tang Enter the 36 Chambers to Only Built for Cuban Linx. Then you throw in soundtracks such as that of The Protector and Afro Samurai Reloaded. And he has a variety of styles he incorporates. He produced Old Man and Biochemical Equation in the same short span (possibly a year).

Uv6fADcaaa	Yes, it's Camp Kill Yourself! <br>  <br>  The lead singer (Deron Miller) is a huge horror movie buff, and the guys came up with the new name in a pizza place shortly after Chad I Ginsburg (lead guitar, and mixes/produces the bands records) joined the band. Before he joined the guys, the band was known as OiL.<br>  <br>  Later, Jess Margera's (drummer) brother used the bands title as the title for his groups prank videos, which featured alot of the bands music. (therefore, confusion on the bands name began, because people not familiar confused the band, videos, and the pranksters in the films)<br>  <br>  They are a great band, who have had a few ups and downs. They have gone through a three bassist, but have a rather talented one at the moment, named Matt Deis. <br>  <br>  New Cd releases in May!<br>  You should check out the guys other bands as well, They aren't CKY, but they roCK pretty hard!<br>  Just thought I would give you some detail.

The initial research into Skynet's development was facilitated using the military.<br>  <br>  In the Terminator storyline, Skynet gains sentience shortly after it is placed in control of all of the U.S. military's weaponry and is given the task to protect humans from all threats. Skynet learns at an exponential rate until it becomes self-aware. The human operators try to shut the system down. It then employs humankind's weapons of mass destruction in a campaign to exterminate the global human population.<br>  <br>  Early development on Skynet was originally done by Cyberdyne Systems, but when the company's headquarters and primary R&D facility were destroyed, the U.S. Air Force took over the project under their newly formed Cyber Research Systems Division and started to perfect Skynet. Skynet was first built as a "Global Digital Defense Network," given command over all computerized military hardware and systems, including the B-2 Stealth Bomber fleet and America's entire nuclear weapons arsenal. The strategy behind Skynet's creation was to remove the possibility of human error and slowness of reaction time to guarantee fast, efficient response to enemy attack.<br>  <br>  However, Skynet became self-aware, thus alarming its creators at its newfound abilities. When the human operators attempted to shut down the system, Skynet defined all humans as its new enemy and decided to terminate all humans to protect its existence. Many nuclear missiles in the United States under Skynet's control were launched at their preset targets in Russia and in the resulting counterattack of Russia's nuclear arsenals, three billion humans were killed in minutes as a result of the nuclear exchange

ye8uqpp5aa	I've heard that Marilyn Manson said that My chemical Romance stole his style and is making a bad attempt at resembling it. I heard that after this Frank from MCR spoke to Manson and said that MCR actually quite admire his work to which Manson responded by offensively calling Frank 'short' or something?! <br>  MCR themself never retaliated but suggestively hinted that Manson was trying to promote his new album through the media attention raised through the controversy. <br>  In my opinion Manson may have had the intention also to want to distance himself from the 'emo' accusations that were being thrown at MCR at the time to avoid being tagged as 'emo' himself.|`|yrkMVrbtaa	Who knows. MCR had like one good album.

The only reason why they let him have so much power is because they were afraid of Kira.

6oWIKqS7aa	I Believe in You<br>  by Niki Haris<br>  <br>  I think
OV2HxkYraa	I highly doubt that she will see her freedom. I can feel that she murdering her daughter and I am sure she will get prison for life sentence. Theres a lot of evidences against her and about the car that proved the most cause of the body has been in the trunk. Also i have read the police interview report about the case that Casey father stated that casey went to anthony's house without caylee to pick up her clothes in mid of june after the days caylee went missing and he reported to the police for stolen gas can worth of $50 that afternoon. And when he went outside and talked with Casey and there are some arguement between him and casey wont reveal on the transcript what the arguement was really about. And george went close to the trunk but casey wouldnt let him cause she almost hit him while she was in the car and she got out and open the trunk and wouldnt let him see whats inside in the trunk and gave him the missing gas can and cussed at him and drove away. That is possibly that caylee is in the trunk at that time. I am not sure what day was but it was the last week of june.

Air was pretty good i really liked the animation <br>  <br>  if you want something not really a show try Studio Ghibli movies they are really good! <br>  <br>  whispers of the heart comes to mind for love interest although im not sure if thats what you mean.|`|e8o2eP6Zaa	Okay, try<br>  <br>  Bleach (skip the fillers though)<br>  <br>  Saiyuki (a MUST WATCH!)- there're three, Gensomaden Saiyuki, Saiyuki Reload and Saiyuki Gunlock<br>  <br>  Those are awesome. As for the ones with romance, I suggest<br>  <br>  DN Angel<br>  Angel Sanctuary<br>  Kaze no Stigma|`|rVCb9v8faa	Since you've seen Tsubasa, try watching xxxHolic. It's the counterpart. xxxHolic is mentions several times in Tsubasa, and vice versa in Tsubasa. Even in the manga.....|`|BVf2eAWnaa	Twelve Kingoms is very epic. It's a fantasy where the main character gets to a different and strange world (bad ending though and so so with romance)<br>  Escaflowne is also about a girl that gets to a strange world + romance<br>  InuYasha is also a girl that "travels" into a different world (not that much romance)<br>  Princess tutu is about a girl who is a duckling ^^<br>  My-Hime - is about girls at the academy for ppl with supernatural abilities.<br>  Special A is a nice romance<br>  Lovely Complex is very funny and cute. The main character is the above average in heigh, Risa..<br>  Hana Yori Dango is a bit old but it's very romantic! <br>  Air is slow-paced romance beautifully animated. <br>  ef - a tale of memories not really epic but it's a great romance anime.<br>  Utawarerumono is another fantasy, it has mystery (but romance is not the big thing in it)<br>  Berserk is also really good, but it is much fighting and blood, so if you don't want such explicitness you shouldn't watch it.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|5FL3W0XYaa	You have to see The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. The animation is fantastic, the plot keeps you wanting more, and yes, there's a romantic interest! Not to mention it's pretty hilarious too. :) Well developed characters and  overall just a really interesting anime.

Risa, a girl, is taller than the average girl, and Otani, a boy, is shorter than the average boy. The two are always bickering and even their teacher sees them as a comedy act. But as their friendship develops, so does Risa's feelings toward Otani.<br>  <br>  <br>  trust me, it's UH-MAZING!|`|XHmwQgOwaa	I'm not a fan of anime, but my sister watched something called Wolf's Rain.<br>  <br>  Sorry, I'm not sure about a love interest.|`|Jhpiy5lFaa	Afro Samarai<br>  FLCL or Fooly Cooly <br>  Golden Boy (the show's hilarious)|`|VRFmyd1Saa	heya<br>  <br>  xxxHolic<br>  D.N angel<br>  Peach girl<br>  lucky star<br>  wallfloer<br>  Skip beat<br>  Bleach<br>  School Days <br>  School rumble <br>  special A<br>  <br>  cya ^^|`|JUcXRaEzaa	kyou kara maou<br>  death note<br>  lovely complex = this really has love interest !!|`|wVKTIzOEaa	um.... well if you want a romantic anime try I's/aizu or something like that.|`|qNoeCRPiaa	Avatar? hahahahaa<br>  <br>  Maybe... ummmm....<br>  I dunno.

Rihanna is that 1 out of 3 women that are battered by their husband/boyfriend.  Albeit she is a celebrity, she is a person first.  The first and primary role model for any young person should always be their parents and family.  If the family tree is dysfunctional then so is the fruit.<br>  To blame the incident on race shows that you may have personal issues about race and are using this tragic incident to prove a point.<br>  <br>  FYI -- Domestic Violence is an equal opportunity offense.  It is equally shared by people from all backgrounds.<br>  <br>  Here is an excerpt from the "Domestic Violence Statistics" specific to the U.S. as a whole:<br>  <br>  DOMESTIC VIOLENCE STATISTICS<br>  <br>  Between 1/3 and 1/2 of all adult women are beaten by their husbands or lovers at some time in their lives. 14% of American women acknowledge having been violently abused by a husband or boyfriend.<br>  <br>  92% of women who were physically abused by their partners did not discuss these incidents with their physicians; 57% did not discuss the incidents with anyone.<br>  <br>  In the U.S., every 9 seconds a woman is physically abused by her husband.<br>  <br>  42% of murdered women are killed by their intimate male partners. 4,000 women are killed each year because of domestic violence.|`|b3783773e6afd95ad1913ece4e9fff9daa	INORITE|`|8xPZ2ZLYaa	rihanna should have left chris the moment that he hit her.....<br>  <br>  and i agree..... if she actually is still with chris, shes not being a good role model to all the young girls who look up to her<br>  <br>  (:

Julian Smith is a very talented musician and doesn't deserve to have some moron treat him like this by creating a spoof video.<br>  <br>  Oh and by the way, people who post genuine questions on this site deserve more respect than to have you "answering" by merely posting repeated links to this pathetic video - you wouldn't like like it if people clicked the answer button on this question then used it as an excuse to post unrelated links.,<br>  <br>  Go to You Tube and look for the sneezing baby panda. I thought that was quite funny. Mum's reaction is great!<br>  <br>  EDIT - I am aware of what the spoof is, it's a swap with the guy who "played the mouth sax" (badly). It just annoyed me greatly that you posted a link to it as an "answer" to about 20 questions, even though it was totally irrelevant and not in the spirit of Yahoo Answers.

dSjWk2SPaa	There are a lot of benefits. First of all, education can be more one-on-one and so you can master a subject even better. <br>  <br>  And you don't have to completely shut out your social life. A lot of homeschoolers, esp. high schoolers do co-ops, which are usually held one day a week. At these co-ops you take classes with other highschoolers and then work on assignments at home during the week. So your parents don't necessarily need to teach you every subject. They will probably just need to grade a few things or make sure you do your work, but that's about it. <br>  <br>  Yes, you shop for school supplies and everything. It's pretty much like regular school, except at home. The advantage is that you can pursue your personal interests more if you are homeschooled. <br>  <br>  Overall, it's a very good option.|`|a118b8144112704be52f2ab81596333baa	Mostly the curriculum would be comparable for your diploma to be valid.  You wouldn't have to walk to school in the cold, but then you wouldn't get snow days and skipping class would be much harder.  Also, the prom would just be disturbing.|`|e8QQW8Weaa	just go to high school, if your social then you will have fun!|`|17a06790cb1f195f6d326ffa70a4ac09aa	<a href="http://www.gurl.com/findout/fastfacts/articles/0,,716544,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gurl.com/findout/fastfacts/ar...</a><br>  this will tell you a lot about homeschooling. hope it helps|`|a5KpcodFaa	One benefot is you will learn to spell benefit and many other words.

XoUfUl6Yaa	Rorschach is based on The Question (masked man in Justice League).<br>  <br>  Dr. Manhattan is based on Captain Atom.<br>  <br>  Ozymandias is based on Thunderbolt (Peter Cannon)<br>  <br>  The Comedian is based on Nick Fury and Peacemaker.<br>  <br>  Nite Owl 2 is based on Batman (obviously) and the Blue Beetle.<br>  <br>  &<br>  <br>  Silk Spectre 2 is based mostly on Black Canary.|`|T6V9zXymaa	Actually Rorschach, like many characters in the Watchmen comics (contrary to popular belief, it was a series of 12 comic books, not a graphic novel), was based on designs from Charlton Comics, which was acquired by DC in 1985.<br>  <br>  Although there are some similarities to "The Question," it's strictly a coincidence. The same could be said (and often is) of many characters in comics today, as they are portrayed in other formats. My most favorite example is the blatant juxtaposition of the "Justice League" DC characters to the Shi'ar Imperial Guard in Marvel. Let's face it:  Gladiator IS Superman. Same powers and everything.  :-)|`|8337a5f518fa30032c1b6f5625f82649aa	Rorschach is a vigilante, he has no super power. His mask has ink on it that reflects his mood and expressions. I am pretty sure that he was an original creation for watchmen and is not based on other super heros.|`|3Sr2FgRfaa	No, Rorschach is a character who was invented specifically for the Watchmen graphic novel. The Watchmen exist in a different fictional universe from the Justice League.

1Kzu7ABmaa	well, there's both. a song like "All the small things" is an example of their happy and upbeat songs, as well as "give me one good reason", "what's my age again", and "the rock show''. but songs like "stay together for the kids", and ''adam's song'' are some of their deeper and heavy songs about divorce, staying together for the kids, and how hard life is when you have parents that are constantly fighting, and then adam's song is about suicide, and how awful some teenagers life is. i would listen to them, because those are also some of their best songs, as well as meaning a lot.|`|t2evcVVEaa	a little bit of both. honestly. probably a little more deep and heavy but with upbeat and light and happy music put to it.|`|3RGqsE7Qaa	It's gotten more substantive as the band has matured.<br>  <br>  Listen to these songs to hear the evolution<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=blink182&view=videos" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=blin...</a>|`|AA11671841	a little bit of both<br>  <br>  but why didnt you pick a band which you do listen to??
f639092fc925bbd55e7b6272eeb17334aa	What is the film actually seeking to do? Stop global warming or make Al Gore rich?<br>  <br>  He speaks a lot of the influences in his life that lead him to stand up and make this speech but he fails to mention that most of his personal fortune is tied up in trying to make changes in the environment. If he gets his way then he will become one of the richest men in the world. As is, he has made fifty times as much money as he had when he left office as vice president and all of it related to telling people how to buy into a system he is heavily invested in. The question is he doing this because it is the right thing or the right for him thing to do.<br>  <br>  Read the attached and you may question his motivations and his lack of disclosure as to his investiture in these ventures.|`|4x2KMVbBaa	I don't think Al Gore hides behind anything. He uses scientific facts and predictions. However, his facts don't go back in time far enough to show us that our earth goes through trends and it goes through periods of coldness and then warming trends. If you look at weather patterns going back to the beginning of time, you can see this.

CRDl9nffaa	New York City schoolkid has storyboard to hand in tomorrow. Desperate, late at night, looks round room for inspiration. Sees history book in School bag. Comes up with stupid story that Statue of Liberty was magic guardian of New York against dragons, eventually destroyed in great battle which finished off the boss dragon.<br>  <br>  Later in week, is given an F for the work. Teacher says 'This was supposed to be a fantasy story, not history'. Kid looks across New York skyline. Statue of Liberty is gone! Turns out that writing the storyboard made it true.<br>  <br>  Kid writes more storyboards. But, not being very imaginative, all involve dragons. Soon the New York skies are full of dragons. Kid's family and friends all get burnt up. He races to special  drawing pad to storyboard them out of existence. The dragon breath gets there first and the pad goes up in flames.<br>  <br>  'School sucks'?! Honestly, babe you slay me! If you're older than about 12 you should be embarrassed coming out with lame stuff like that:)<br>  <br>  Best of luck, though. Hope it works out.|`|9xgGd9praa	Giant bats eat your teacher :D|`|UXuSI6EZaa	try this. use your current situation as the basis for the story itself. <br>  <br>  except in your fantasy storyboard, the artist guy (you) can't finish any panel since what he draws become real and jump off the page. which gets the guy in trouble of course, because his place is now full of cartoon critters that feed on everything they see. to contain them, the guy has to chase & erase each one--- with the eraser on his pencil rapidly getting shorter with every erasure. comic hell ensues.<br>  <br>  have fun & enjoy!

Warm ups can include humming your favorite song or singing something like "row, row, row your boat." Another great exercise for range increase includes humming your lowest note, then moving up to your highest and back down like a siren. Do it a few times, and you should already notice a difference. It is always best to warm up the middle voice before moving to the high and low extremes. <br>  Breathe correctly. You should be breathing with your diaphragm, in other words, your chest shouldn't move, and your belly should move out when you breathe in and in when you breathe out. Stand up straight, and try singing some quick "ha, ha" to feel quick the quick puffs of air that come right from the lower parts of your belly. This is called "support" of the voice. <br>  Start in the middle of your range and sing higher and higher. Keep singing along the notes scaling up and down. Never strain your voice. Your throat should not hurt. Drink enough water to hydrate your vocal chords. <br>  Find the right vowel modification. Each voice has certain vowels that work best when one sings above the staff. You should experiment to determine which vowels work best for you. Once you have an idea of which vowel works best, modify (gradually) towards that vowel as you ascend the scale. (Don't be afraid to use mixed vowels like singing the vowel in "head" while rounding your lips like an "oh") <br>  Think low. If you imagine the note is low rather than high, it will seem easier to sing- you won't be straining your voice. <br>  Repeat. throughout a period of time until you get the desired results.
TQge2oBVaa	Oh, HOLY CRAP! Someone else who actually knows that Kamelot, the greatest band EVER, actually exists. First let me say, if you don't know about bands like Nocturnal Rites, Starbreaker, and Andre Matos, then look them up. If you like Kamelot, these bands WON'T dissapoint you.<br>  <br>  Now, on to your question. If you look up the Wikipedia listing for the Epica and Black Halo Albums, you will find that they are 2 parts of a story (called a rock opera) about a man and his journey through life, and encounters with Mephisto, and I believe 2 women.<br>  <br>  In the story at this point the man, named Ariel, decides that after all the bad he has done in the past, he cannot repent and make up for it all. So he decides to sail across the sea, in search of Mephisto, and he reaches his lair by the end of the song.<br>  <br>  Now, there may be a literal meaning behind this song as well. Roy Khan (the singer) has had some heartbreak in the past with a girl he was in a LONG relationship with. He often puts some of that emotion, and hints of his pain in his lyrics, but they are VERY well hidden as he is a very poetic writer. This is much more difficult to extract from the song, but if you look hard enough you may be able to find it.<br>  <br>  Kamelot forever!<br>  <br>  They need to do a Dual Album with Queensryche, another great band, and one of their influences. The first CD would be them remaking eachothers songs. The second would be them making new songs together! that would be the best CD ever, and I would pay WELL over $100 dollars for it. Just saying, since I have never met another person who knows who Kamelot is without me showing them first. :)))<br>  <br>  In my sources I will put the links to the Epica Wiki, and the Black Halo Wiki. I would start reading the pages at where it says characters, if you want to get the full gist of the story.

None of us should fight like that. But yes I know, it does happen.<br>  <br>  I am on your side. Just making a recommendation for the future. Which - depending on the severity of the fight - may not be possible. Why? Because some members of family can be really threatening.

Wn0Hj7H4aa	Because it is!|`|sPiwb8Hraa	They are using the same guitar cords, simply re-arraned into different compositions.<br>  <br>  Metallica -> G & R -> AC/DC|`|pNUtnoC8aa	It really is terribly and annoyingly repetitive I agree. I'm not sure I guess it's the sound the band preferd. Or they did not obtain the talent to mix it up. Either way they are overrated.<br>  <br>  <br>  Poll: Metallica no one can shred like James and Kirk.|`|XhJuHMwQaa	AC/DC's music sounds no more all the same than Metallica's music.  I think you don't really know what your talking about.

Six months later they managed to get it banned, and then became huge nearly overnight. Not much interest in it before the controversy. And their Lies album had actually been released several years earlier but bombed, so was re-released after they were more popular.<br>  Metallica, who are my least favourite of the three, I saw in concert the same year I saw ACDC, and there is no competition- ACDC hands down.<br>  Make no mistake, I enjoy all these bands immensely, but ACDC gets my vote.|`|uHxfAyjBaa	You obviously cannot pick up the subtleties in music.<br>  <br>  Stick with hip-hop.|`|5oBYGB5Vaa	For the same reason that Bob Seeger's stuff sounded the same -- they don't know that many chords! ~:)>|`|qYFeeU8Saa	They knew better than to mess with perfection.|`|m2eHPeciaa	b/c thats they're style i guess.... mmm i'd still go with AC/DC|`|vdmqdlNfaa	Because you are tone deaf.<br>  There's no help for it sorry.|`|kXJ4dcrXaa	Because it it the same.|`|YIknUCHvaa	yes

o4T0dScfaa	What are both of your Venus signs? This will help answer the question.|`|LrKCLZF7aa	I really can help you but not with this information. Please provide the DOB's with location and time. I will give you the best answer you will find.<br>  <br>  The only thing you will get from this question is more confusion. I've seen it happen too many times. The Sun Moon and Rising signs don't even rule attraction or love. They don't rule friendship or even sexual relations. There is really no way of telling with these three.<br>  <br>  My charts are complete charts with longitude and declinations in geocentric and heliocentric. This is how I can get away with not reading signs or house. I have a lot more aspects than the average astrologer and my orbs are tighter.|`|2sjoezimaa	It's hard to say.

37evQRaDaa	You can make a nice looking guitar from easily obtainable materials. <br>  * A stick of 1x2x36 inch hardwood (poplar is easy to work with, oak is more durable)<br>  * A cigar box or other wooden box (a cardboard box would work too)<br>  * Tuners can be made from eye bolts) (see links below)<br>  * Strings can be made with fishing line). <br>  * If you want frets you can use wire, zip ties, or toothpicks. <br>  <br>  They're easy to make, and sound good. With a couple extra parts (about $5 worth) you can even make it electric (EXTRA CREDIT!)<br>  <br>  You can also build a kalimba from stiff metal and a wooden box. I built a couple using bike spokes and rake tines. Actually I've made one from a cardboard box and wooden stir sticks. I've done these electric too.

K2h6M1xqaa	Hey there.  I'm a Gemini, and I definitely find that the signs which are supposed to work best with me indeed do so.<br>  <br>  Another VERY useful thing to check is your animal sign in the Chinese astrology system.  (It's based on Jupiter, the "Year Star", as they called it.)  It can tell a lot about you and the people you best match with.<br>  <br>  People born multiples of four years apart match very well with each other, (except for people of the same animal sign; that's not ideal.)  I'm a Dog, and I match well with Tigers and Horses.  I find when I meet somebody of a compatible year, and a compatible Western sign, the sparks fly like crazy.  It's very, very easy to fall in love or make excellent friends with compatible animals.<br>  <br>  In Western astrology, every second sign is quite compatible.  Odd signs are 'hot' and Even signs are 'cool', (or perhaps its the other way around; though you get what I mean.)  I've dated Cancers and Scorpios, and that's very hard; they're very emotional and moody, which is powerful stuff and very good when they are within their own energetic type, but Geminis do best with high energy signs like Air and Fire, (Leo, Aquarius, etc.)  I find I get along really well with Libras, but my best match, apparently, is Sagittarius.  One of my best friends since childhood is a Sag.<br>  <br>  The moon sign is sort of your emotional side, and Virgo is a 'cool' sign.  That means while you are high energy though even-keeled and well balanced due to the Libra-sun, your inner emotions are more Virgo.  A nice combination.<br>  <br>  The most fun I've had with a partner was with an Aquarius.  The most intense love I've felt was for an Aries; it was all-consuming.  Though the most pleasant love was with a Libra; it wasn't sparkly and crazy, but deep and nourishing.<br>  <br>  Your best match, from everything I've read and seen, would be with an Aries with something 'cool' on the Moon side.  --And if you found an animal type which fits in your 'trine' then you'd be in heaven!<br>  <br>  I don't know much about rising signs or what part of the personality that relates to.<br>  <br>  Cheers and good luck!|`|QmV0KTonaa	Hmm...I was researching astrology just for fun and I read that, according vedic astrology, the libra-gemini match is the most powerful out of all possible matches. <br>  <br>  I'm not really serious about astrology, but then again, I always seem to fall for the geminis.|`|lvrcRLU8aa	I'm a Libra and I love being with my Libra than a GEMINI !|`|AA11946996	I'm a Gemini and mostly I get along with all signs on one level or another.

The rashi lord of male Jupiter and that of female Saturn are neutral to each other. Both the boy and the girl have the same nadi i-e Antya as per their nakshatras;  Revti-2 and Utrashada-2. rekoning nadi from Nakshatra pada the nadis of bothe remain Antya.

EuwjIJ3Zaa	First:  This person is too young to have a career.  That Stellium in Capricorn screams early 90's, so I doubt they've established themselves very well up to this point, to actually call it a career.  However, I will outline the roads of least resistance, that I can see, which ofcourse can vary.<br>  <br>  What you're asking for is impossible.  A person can't look at a chart and state your career is this, or your career is that.  However, it ispossible to outline the roads of least resistance, and in my opinion, these are the major ones.  A placement won't tell you what you will do, or what you believe, or who you are.  But, it can outline the greatest possibilities, if you take the intiative to apply yourself.<br>  <br>  1:  There is a fixed T-Square in this chart, which is the strongest modality of a T-Square that can be had. It builds lots of pressure in the planets associated with it, that begs for release of some sort.<br>  <br>  The most important thing I can point out for careers, is house positioning.  The planets will tell us how we do something, but for recognizing the direction we need to take, the houses are the best tool, as that's the specific area of life that the energy of the aspects, are going to actually be manifesting in our lives.<br>  <br>  The T-Square's apex is found in Mars in the 12th, with the opposition being formed between Sun in the 2nd and Pluto in the 8th. 2nd= Money 8th=Shared money.  This person can put a lot of energy towards finances, retail; basically anything involving assets.  IC is being closely aspected by Venus., and Chiron is conjunct Venus.  This person can work very well with people, even if people are sometimes a pain in their lives, which they very well may be.  With Venus conjunct the IC, relations should be important in their life, even if their not.<br>  <br>  This is only amplied by Taurus sun, being in it's native home in the 2nd, along with Jupiter (planet of luck) in a tight conjunction to the Sun.  Furthermore, by the person being a female Taurus, as they actually have an easier time making money, than their male counterparts.  The females actually embody the female principles of venus, while the men tend to rely on others to provide it for them.<br>  <br>  With Mars being in Aquarius , and the Apex of the T-Square, this person could probably be very entreprenurial, as they can exhibit much ingenuity.<br>  <br>  2:  The Midheaven is conjunct Saturn and Uranus.  Whatever it is that this person does, it needs to be unique.  This person should not work in an office building, or in an enclosed space, with boring repetition. Furthermore, by Saturn being right on the Midheaven, whatever this person does, they need to make sure they are able to do it with a clear mind.  There is a danger of what they say or do coming back to them in a big way.  Saturn and Uranus at the midheaven screams individuality, so whatever this person does, it shold be unique, if they want to truly be happy.<br>  <br>  With Saturn conjunct the MC, a person has a tendecy to put lots of sacrifice and effort into their lives, to be someone, or something important in the world.  However, this person may feel uncomfortable in the spotlight.  <br>  <br>  The only thing that would probably hold this person back, is Venus conjunct IC and Saturn conjunct MC.  Saturn/Venus contacts can lend a person towards feeling less than great.  There can be deeply rooted insecurities, especially with Saturn on the MC, and Venus in the IC.  This opposition is directly on two fo the most prominent points of your chart, so it probably manifests fairly greatly.  Chiron is also conjunct the IC as well as Venus, so this only amplifies the chances that this person will feel a bit of anixiety about ever really putting themselves out there to 'try' at life.<br>  <br>  3: Sun, Jupiter and Mercury are all inconjunct planets at the MC. This means that a lot of focus is actually going to be placed on their position in the world, because a lot fo energy in their chart is being transmuted to that Cardinal point, representative of our public lives.|`|069d241743d397f7bc4dca280e447738aa	I would guess a career involving medicine, the occult, mysticism, or something involving finances and business, such as a CEO.
