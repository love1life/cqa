2d63894d5d03bc3e3ec3921e71eba0d7aa	Lean liberal but am first and foremost an american no matter what happens. I think the average person on the street could do better than any democrat or republican in office right now.|`|e68ed70654e71ea7f425cc92736a0d51aa	I am actually conservative.  <br>  <br>  But to be fair, if a government were to practice Keynesian econmics, both ends would have to be used.  <br>  <br>  During times of recession, the government would need to increase spending to help "stimulate" the economy.  Of course this spending would be targeted toward maintaining jobs, and income to the treasury.  It would not include spending that would otherwise, be considered "pork".  This stimulus bill was not Keynesian in nature, it was spending to be spending.<br>  <br>  The other end, would say that during good times, government spending would decrease, for the market would maintain the jobs  and income into the treasury.<br>  <br>  So in realism, during a recession, you would deficit spend.  During boom times you would balance and pay the debt.<br>  <br>  Not that I believe in that philosophy, for I am a conservative.|`|Fyq5nK4waa	Conservative, Libertarian.  <br>  <br>  Let the free-market decide.  All the government should do is create competition by not allowing monopolies and oligopolies.  <br>  <br>  Bailouts only keep incompetent executive management, unions, lazy workers, and poor products, in power.  Bailouts reward the evil.|`|e8851b9f0ff261603f2a648b1ce253ccaa	Conservative|`|yJE7INkUaa	In this economy, i think that government spending makes more sense. I do believe in a free-market to some degree, i think that we should have as little as regulation as possible, but we cant go without regulation completely.<br>  <br>  I think the best thing that the government could do is create jobs. People arent spending money because there is a high risk of loosing their job so they are saving it instead of buying a new car. The only way we will revive the state of the economy is if money is circulating. If you lose the fear of loseing your job, or you know that if you do lose your job you will eaisly be able to get a new job, people will start to use their money again. <br>  <br>  I also think re-newable energy is a great way to revive the economy. Tons of jobs will be created to build wind wills and sun panels not to mention jobs in the corperations who build things things and we would also wouldnt have to depend on forgien oil, which in the long run will save us huge amounts of money. You dont have to pay for wind ot the sun, not to mention, they wount run out. Also by buying forgien oil we are pretty much enabling countries in the middle east who hate us, to attack us because with the money we give them for oil, they are able to buy weapons and become richer and more powerful.|`|gaWY0O3caa	Conservative to the bone!|`|uZ0NOD8zaa	A bit liberal leaning|`|4Vmlf902aa	I think our government should increase spending, but not right now! Obviously letting businesses/ consumers decide something doesn't work all the time. Because during hard time the business would fire employee, employee cuts back on spending, business earns less of a profit, and then cancels projects/plans for our infrastructure. I'm thinking Caterpillar would do something like that. Both might work well though.|`|UXc6lMZBaa	Conservative.

But,socialism dictates that redistribution  will make the poor man financially equal to the rich man (THEY WILL THEN BOTH BE POOR).  obama and the liberal congress know this and i still wonder why they are trying to make the U.S. a socialist society|`|CjpLFJgVaa	Oh you mean redistributing the wealth, by taking money from the ones who work to earn it and then give it to those who are able to work and don't do it?  I think it enables those to keep sucking on the govt. tit who are able bodied and can work to stay dependent on the govt.<br>  <br>  I heard this used as an analogy.  A farmer's daughter comes home from college with a friend of hers who's a die hard liberal, and his daughter's friend is talking about how there needs to be redistribution of wealth by taking from the rich and giving to the poor.  The farmer listened and asked the girl after she was done, say in school, your working hard and your pulling straight A's in school, and say my daughter wasn't doing so well, and they asked you to give some of your A's to my daughter, what would you say?  And the girl said no way, I worked hard to earn those, why should I give them to someone who doesn't work to earn them?  And the farmer said, Now your starting to think like a Republican.<br>  <br>  Think about it, why should us hard working Americans give our hard earned money that we work to earn, give that to people who are lazy and are able to work, but don't.  Why should we give our hard earned money to those who won't work to earn it themselves?|`|Hb7TW09saa	you must make over $250k per year...cuz that's the only way you should be complaining, otherwise if you make less than that you'll get a break on your taxes..not sure how you call that spreading the wealth.|`|L592wjsjaa	Yes.

This can be good or bad to Americans depending upon what it is.  America is also in an insane amount of debt right now as well, in the long run this could hurt.<br>  <br>  Try not to think of countries power and competition.... it's very inaccurate to do so.  Every country is in a phase of inter-dependency.  America wouldn't be near as strong as it is without its trading partners... nor would any other country be.  In a world of inter-dependency it's rather childish to be concerned about "who's number one".|`|i6d582PFaa	the economic downturn apparently has not stopped the military billions.

The political spectrum is broad and they are both very far apart.  Socialism involves making all equal by using the state to allocate jobs, housing, food, etc.  Centre-left parties merely want to make life's nenecessities little fairer, such as giving free health care to all rather than letting people die just because they're poor and allowing all access to college education by subsidising tutuitionees.  <br>  <br>  Some Americans seem to regard the election of President Obama as the advent of socialism but it's not - he's a centre-left politician, not a socialist.  He's not proposing to take all property under state control or to place all businesses under state ownership.  He just wants to make life a little fairer for those who would otherwise struggle.|`|a4cbb1844a67d408350ea2b885855ebeaa	Socialism is really a buzzword to many people with no real understanding of its meaning.

Your savior has arrived.<br>  <br>  Just listen to the philosophy of his Idols<br>  <br>  Alinsky viewed as supremely important the role of the organizer, or master manipulator, whose guidance was responsible for setting the agendas of the People’s Organization. "The organizer," Alinsky wrote, "is in a true sense reaching for the highest level for which man can reach -- to create, to be a 'great creator,' to play God."<br>  <br>  One of Obama's early mentors in the Alinsky method was Mike Kruglik, who had this to say to an interviewer of The New Republic, about Obama:<br>  <br>  "He was a natural, the undisputed master of agitation, who could engage a room full of recruiting targets in a rapid-fire Socratic dialogue, nudging them to admit that they were not living up to their own standards. As with the panhandler, he could be aggressive and confrontational. With probing, sometimes personal questions, he would pinpoint the source of pain in their lives, tearing down their egos just enough before dangling a carrot of hope that they could make things better."<br>  <br>  After Columbia, Obama spent a year in New York and was then hired by a community organizer for the Developing Communities Project (DCP) of the Calumet Community Religious Conference (CCRC) in Chicago. The "Project" was funded by Bill Ayers' Woods Fund, which raises the question, "did Obama meet Ayers" while both were students in New York? They lived and attended school in the same neighborhood.<br>  <br>  Obama was 24 years old, unmarried, and according to his memoir, searching for a genuine African-American community.<br>  <br>  Both the CCRC and the DCP were built on the Alinsky model of community agitation, wherein paid organizers learned how to, in Alinsky's words, "rub raw the sores of discontent."<br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.theobamafile.com/BarackObama...." rel="nofollow">http://www.theobamafile.com/BarackObama....</a>|`|acWyJ3t0aa	That is a total crock of BS and he knows it , but with his charisma and the blindly following sheep Democrats , then they can continue forever to feed off the Pork Barrell spending and watch this country go down the drains while we sponsor such things as Palestinians who need help coming to America and Help to perform abortions if foreign countries .<br>  When does the USA ever going to get help while the banks just continue to hold out their hands then use the fundsfor CEO raises and to buy new jets .<br>  TRUST the banks ?

Listen I am no prophet, but I predicted this to friends and family a year and a half ago when Obama was running for Pres., but it fell on deaf ears..The scenario was there for anyone with half a brain to see, but people were blindsighted because they made Bush the Ogre, and they would do anything to get rid of him, and that meant even electing someone like Obama..the liberal media helped; the banking institution crash which was crafted by sinister forces; and McCain fell right into their trap; and Obama was handed the Presidency on a silver platter..Case closed.  People were searching for a savior and now they have him...but the puppet masters control him, so anything he does and says is well crafted and designed to control the media; the opposition and the Masses (which the Marxists call the people)...This is very serious and I really fear for my country.

We are not dealing with a religion, the Bull of wall street is a statue it does not care how much government money is spent.  The economy is not a deity that needs to be apprised either.  We are dealing with pure simple facts of life, and when you raise taxes, in every nation, in every time the economy suffers.  Something to do with the fact who became rich on there own and built there own businesses being able to apply there own funds in a more dynamic way then the federal government.  Its just insane but hang on here keep reading.  Think about it, would you give a 100 dollars to a bum on the street the smells of alcohol?  I didn't think so, we look at it as a investment.  If you said yes, you either have more money then you know what to do with or your heart truly goes out to people and have no money.  But on the other hand, would you pay someone else to make you more money?  the answer is yes you would.  WIthout a shadow of a doubt.  Think about it as paying someone half your pay check to do your job for you.  You say then I would not have as much money, but that goes to show that you are unwilling to work another job in place of the one being by your employee.  Your making 75% more money when you are able to keep and spend your own money.  You wouldn't go buy candy with it all.  You would spend your money wisely.  "Miracles" do not happen in the economy, nor are we faithful in the acts of another man who has no interest if we see a return on our investment into government spending.  Yes it is a investment, if you give the government your money they should not spend a 1.33 for every dollar you give them.  THat is a 1986 statistic too, just imagine how much they are spending when the pass almost 3 trillion in spending with in three months.  I do not know how that apply to only about 150 billion dollars a month being taken into taxes.  The economy will worsen here soon.  Just what for the tax rate on all those people who make over 250,000 goes up a extra 15% as well as the Bush tax cut expire in 2010.

bmCInR5qaa	How does the church deciding marital contracts, etc insure religious freedom?  We don't need that kind of religious freedom.

If marriage is an institution of religion, then congress can pass no law respecting it. In that case marriage would be only a religious ceremony and would have no legal standing in civil court. But if marriage is a civil contract which binds two people together in the same family with certain recognized legal rights, then the various interpretations by religious groups should have no bearing on how the state defines marriage. In reality, marriage exists as both a civil and a religious institution. But in both cases marriage is a request made to the community around them to accept condone, and validate the union of the people involved. Should the public be forced to condone and validate something that they consider intrinsically wrong? There is no doubt that government has no right to force a particular religious group to condone anything it defines as a sin. But isn't the opposite also true? Does any religion have the right to impose sanctions on non-believers because of something it considers a sin? We already have marriages in law that are not recognized by some religions. Some religions believe marrying outside the faith is wrong. You can still legally do it, but it will not be recognized by the church. And there are religious marriages not condoned by law. Polygamy is the biggest example. But some religious sects condone underage marriage, marriage to relatives. And Catholic nuns are all married to God, but the law doesn't consider that legally binding. This is where the line between what is right, legal, and moral gets really blurry. But basically just because one person or group chooses to recognize and legitimize a particular form of marriage in no way forces anyone else to do the same. If you feel that gay marriage is wrong, then you have every right to refuse to recognize it as valid. If you feel it is right, you can accept and condone it whether it is legally recognized or not. This whole debate is about the inherent legitamacy of the word "marriage" Everyone wants it to be important say they all want the right to define it. And if you let other people define it differently than you, then it somehow loses its meaning. But for all intents and purposes, it doesn't affect you one bit how anyone else chooses to interpret the word. Its just a word. Now if you want a real debate about freedom of religion, lets talk about banning prayer on school campuses. That is blatant violation of the free exercise clause.|`|nNmusYZSaa	No church ought to be compelled to perform gay weddings if they are opposed to them, just like the Catholics currently refuse to marry people who have been divorced.<br>  <br>  That being said, marriage is essentially a civil contract that confers  certain rights and responsibilities on those who choose to enter into it, as such it should be available to all consenting adults.<br>  <br>  Those who want church weddings still have to go fill out the civil license eventually...|`|hMLmrPbgaa	"Last summer the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, once again, that mere taxpayer status confers no standing to sue the government when it allegedly spends money unconstitutionally.

Whether the state makes gay marriage legal or not does not take away from whether or not it is a sin.|`|78z7gk7naa	Well, with gay marriage its not really a church issue anymore. Marriage is basically a contract now. Marriage gives you many more rights with your partner than a civil union, or a normal relationship will give you. You can get "married" in a church but you wont get rights till you sign that piece of paper declaring you and your partner are married.<br>  <br>  Thats why many people take this issue to state, not the church.<br>  But many people view this as a religious issue, when it really isnt. The only religious aspect is where the "wedding" is held and how people blindly define marriage. (And you dont have to have a wedding in a church either!)<br>  <br>  Also, I don't understand if this IS a religious issue, why can atheists be married but not gays? I never got this.|`|HSADGmMMaa	Not necessarily...gay marriage really concerns the laws of marriage. Yes, religion plays a part in some marriages, but marriage is a legal issue also. Those who are gay and lesbian, they want the same legal rights as male/female marriages...like...if one spouse dies, the other will be entitled to certain things.  Or what to do with children.

I think that gay marriage shouldn't be debated too much unless it's for mere discussion and actually the whole  thing should have nothing to do with Church because of the interpretation of homosexuality based on the Bible. It's not really a "godly" thing so those marriages shouldn't have anything to do with the Church. But, if someone decides to have their wedding at a church and the people of the church are okay with it, then go ahead. <br>  <br>  I believe that people should have the freedom to have the right to choose, but honestly this country was founded on Christian values so it's hard to fight against it. I think they could have the unions approved by the government, but when it comes to the Church I think they need to just stay away from that. <br>  <br>  And religious groups are always going to try and get involved and try to stop it, but you know they're going to approve it one day.|`|9JGDmWxvaa	Why do people think it's right to blow themselves up along with 2000 other people in the name of Allah?<br>  Why do people think it's right to kill 9 million people for the "greater good"? <br>  <br>  People are scum, that's why, religion or no.

If so it is not going to be pretty. <br>  <br>  But on the bright side, what the heck there is like 100 times more debt in the world and maybe they can fool the market and get it going again, but sad that the only two things people still had that the crooks had not stolen, the home equity and the 401ks been under open season.<br>  <br>  I suggest the president stop yapping about how bad it is and figure out that Clinton robbed the military to pay Paul, Bush used Reaganomics during to wars and now this man is spending like a drunk Bill and George.<br>  <br>  This inflation is going nuts.

For some I suppose ignorance is bliss. But then what happens when the sky starts falling and you have no preparations in place? Don't stress it. Just learn and take steps to be prepared.

a8e1KcS2aa	I'd recommend a Sig Sauer P229 in a .40 cal.  It's a great looking gun, shoots very well, and is backed by a great manufacturer and is well-made.  <br>  <a href="http://sigsauer.com/Products/ShowCatalogProductDetails.aspx?categoryid=8&productid=63" rel="nofollow">http://sigsauer.com/Products/ShowCatalog...</a><br>  You can get one for about $500 in good condition used from your local gun dealer, possibly less.<br>  <br>  I'd also recommend a Smith & Wesson revolver...(I have a model 681, they don't make 'em any more, but if you can find a comparable model...) I'd spend about $500 bucks on this as well... get .357 Magnum (great home-defense round) and it shoots a .38 special, as was mentioned before.<br>  <br>  For 'plinking' I'd go with a Walther P22, Beretta Cheetah 87, or SigSauer Mosquito.  Beretta Neo shoots well but looks weird and has an awkward grip configuration.  I have had terrible experiences with Smith and Wesson semi-autos and I believe the only thing they're good at making is revolvers.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for a lighter gun, Glock makes a real light weapon, no matter what model.  They shoot well, and are of comparable quality to Sig.  Beretta makes stellar 9mms, but I haven't fired anything but their 9's and .22s.  (9mm is the worst round ever made, I would recommend not getting a 9mm.)<br>  <br>  Ruger makes some sweet weapons, but I've only fired the 9mm and .22s from them as well. (SR9, was it?)<br>  <br>  Browning makes good weapons as well - I've fired a couple Browning .40s and would recommend them as well.<br>  <br>  Kahr has the best concealed weapons that I've seen - I forget what model, but my friend uses a Kahr .40 that has 7 in the mag +1 in chamber, and it's about the size of my palm.  Dead accurate, too.<br>  <br>  As evidenced above, every gun has its strengths/weaknesses, but from what I've seen and used, I'd recommend the Sig.  Their slogan is "To hell and back reliability." for a reason.  I've yet to have a malfunction with my P229, and I've put probably 10,000 rounds through it (although I maintain it very well and check my magazine springs and what-not).|`|6Gfz125Paa	Think about this:  if you own a gun, it is more likely that you or someone in your house will use it for suicide or domestic violence than you using it to defend yourself against an attacker.  And this is extra-true for you, since judging from your question you don't know the first thing about guns.  <br>  <br>  If, after very careful consideration, you decide that there is some large threat that you need to protect yourself against, then I'd highly recommend you enroll in a reputable safety course where they teach you all the basics of firearm handling, and then go buy one when you're comfortable.  You can't just walk into a store and buy a gun.  Well, you could, but it would be stupid.|`|6cd7cae3f8d44a82dd6c9bf47a165cd6aa	I like glocks but you must practice shooting them or they will jam on a rookie. Firm wrist.

Anti-gunners constantly throw out statements such as that, despite the fact that said statements have no basis in fact, nor any statistics to back them up.<br>  <br>  However, I do completely agree with taking a safety course. It is vital to become familiar with proper gun safety, and to familiarize yourself with the weapon that you buy, before you have to use it in an emergency.<br>  <br>  In spite of the anti-gunner philosophy, most pro gun people are VERY serious about weapon safety, and do not advocate the use of firearms by anyone who is not properly trained in the use of firearms.<br>  <br>  And, in spite of the idea that, you MIGHT not ever have to use the weapon for self defense, having that weapon available may very well save your life if someone breaks into your home with intent to hurt you.|`|CdekvqhGaa	I just got my mom a Ruger P95, decent price, good gun, highly reliable.<br>  <br>  I own you average Glock and Remington 870, nothing exotic.

Instead of making real plans to get us out of this mess, Obama pushed a pork bill that threw us into a debt that ALL the Presidents combined before him, from Washington on up, have not spent that much TOTAL.  The TOTAL combined debt from all Presidents is LESS than what Obama did in 2 months.  That alone will cause us to suffer for years and years.

JDltTREfaa	I'd look into the base salary for those officers.  I'd be willing to bet that the officers who earned $100k pulled a LOT of overtime.  My husband has worked in law enforcement for over 15 years.  He has a B.A. and is a supervisor and he made a little over $80k last year, but he worked a TON of overtime.  As our kids get older (they are between 2 and 5 right now), he will work less OT so he can spend more time with them.<br>  <br>  But overall, it's not a money making career if you want a 9 to 5 career.  My husband has a constantly rotating schedule (shifts and days off).  If he wants extra money he has to work on his days off, etc.  It's can be a really grueling job.|`|fMNiz9vfaa	Does that $100K include overtime? Benefits?  Sometimes the published amounts of government workers' salaries don't really reflect what is earned on an hourly basis.

Five years can get a college education, or proper training for a better job.<br>  <br>  Why should everybody that works pay your bills for you? <br>  <br>  We go to work everyday and bust our asses.<br>  <br>  I have travel for work; I sleep in a hotel room ten nights a month. I miss my family, but I have to house them and put bread on the table; however I shouldn't have to put bread on "your friend's" table. My money is my money, not your friend's. She can earn her own.<br>  <br>  If she couldn't afford five kids, she shouldn't have had five kids, it's not my fault you screwed up. <br>  <br>  You're a socialist, move to Russia; you can be lazy all you want there.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I read more of the information<br>  <br>  Your question is riddled with absolutely awful grammar and sentence structure. <br>  <br>  "but she only gets paid about $944 a months. why do republican think she shouldnt have a house for free. why should she still need to pay for a rent"<br>  <br>  Simple answer: Republicans work.<br>  That's not even liberal, that's socialist. That's something Karl Marx would say(I doubt you knowwho he is). Who pays for her house? Me and all the other income tax payers. In your world there is NO INCENTIVE TO WORK. If I had no incentive to work, I wouldn't, nobody would. Then nothing would get done and we would be France. I have an idea! Go to France with your friend and live there! <br>  <br>  A free house, really? Is this question a joke? Are you serious? Your listening to Obama too much.  <br>  <br>  She doesn't even maake $250 a week? That's got to be a PART-TIME job.

That is plenty of time to get a job or get training so you can get a job.  Welfare and food stamps are supposed to be to help people over a rough spot, not to support you in place of working.<br>  <br>  Not many people can afford to take care of seven kids.   If your friend has no way to support them, she should not have continued having children.  That is irresponsible.  It is not up to the gov't to support her because she had so many children.<br>  <br>  If she is not disabled, she needs to go to work and support herself and her family.  Her children should be her highest priority.  I don't care what job I had to take but I would never allow my kids to go hungry.  It is her responsibility to get out there and work.<br>  <br>  Why does she think that people like me who work and pay taxes, should reward her for having so many children?  I do not want my money going to support someone who can't be responsible for their own lives.  She can work two jobs if she doesn't make enough.  I don't care what she has to do.  It's her life, her children.  Not mine.  Why does she think it's the government's job to give her money?

In order to do well, you have to be commited to the cause. <br>  You can always drop out of football, or take a summer off in college but the USMC is a commitment that you cannot get out of.<br>  If you are not in it for the right reasons you will hate life. The job can suck pretty bad sometimes, but as long as you have the right mindset it is a great experience. <br>  I personally would hate to work for some type of jock go-getter jackass who is only in it to suck up to higher ranks and improve his resume. If that Lt. didn't actually care about the job or his men those men will hate him for it. You don't want to go to war with 40 guys who hate your guts.

This way they can have as much time as possible to find someone else to fill your slot.

AA12181093	The entire state of California is 10pm.  It's been that way for 30 years or longer.    <br>  <br>  <br>  When I was a kid & teen in the 80s & 90s, it was loosely enforced.  Which meant that we knew about the curfew & obeyed it through our parents.  Most of us weren't allowed outside after dark & when the streetlights were on to play, UNLESS 3 or more adults were outside with us or it was a holiday like Memorial weekend, 4th of July weekend or Labor Day weekend.  Even then, most everyone packed it in by 10pm.<br>  <br>  <br>  I live not too far from Ontario Mills Outlet Mall.  The last time I was there, about 6 weeks ago, there were signs posted about the 10pm statewide curfew & that the local police & security were strictly enforcing the curfew.  My son & I were in Gameworks til around 8pm & saw several security & local police roaming the outlet mall grounds, reminding teens & pre-teens about the 10pm curfew.|`|eulMjLtPaa	There is no one state curfew law.  <br>  <br>  However, I did a couple of searches, and each site said there is no youth curfew for Livermore.

You should meticulously draft a letter mentioning the circumstances, date, time and even witnesses, if any, in presence of whim you might have lent your money.  You should also ensure that he acknolwedges receipt of your letter and engage him in exchange of letters.

If the economy loses 2.5 million jobs they can say "look, it worked. it would have been 6.5 million without this package."<br>  Unfortunately, the 'stimulus' is more about politics than about the economy. Why ? First, most of the spending is geared toward programs that had failed to pass muster in congress over the last 20 years. And second, why would most of the spending be pushed over a year into the future, just prior to the 2010 elections? If it was so "urgent" that it be passed post haste why such a delay in spending?

Hxttt7G0aa	Grignax, you have no idea what worked or not. Someone who calls an across  the board tax cut a tax cut or give away to the rich proves they are clueless and caught up in idiocratic rhetoric.<br>  <br>  Of course you can't cut taxes on those who DON"T PAY THEM, right? If you do cut, those who pay 100 X more taxes for the same system will have more savings because they had so much more taken, so to make a deal about their getting more cuts is beyond idiotic ...<br>  <br>  It's the effects that are important, not the amount of poo the poo tossing monkeys can throw at a subject ... I mean if you want to affect the dynamics of the economy anyway, but the poo tossing monkeys are not really into that, or they are just playing dumb and want the economy down because what hurts everyone else, helps them get some objectives accomplished.<br>  <br>  Kennedy knew tax cuts worked, so did Regan, so did Bush.They all made these tax cuts work with great success. <br>  <br>  Now, you are going to say no they didn't, and for proof you are going to say "look at the economy now" as if it had anything to do with the Bush policy, it doesn't. Bush brought us back from the Clinton recession (no, there was not a surplus, that was a lie based on an idiotic forecast which was wrong, we know this because it never happened, get it?) The Bush policy brought us back from 911, and Katrina, and the economy was strong and producing more revenue though tax rates were cut, in fact that always happens. Raising taxes cuts tax revenue received and lowering them raises it. Obama knows this, he just doesn't want a good economy because a trashed one helps him get his agenda passed and gain more control. <br>  <br>  What trashed our economy?<br>  1. Obstruction of economical fuel resources, ANY economical fuel resources from oil drilling, natural gas, nuclear, hydro electric, or anything else that would provide economical energy.<br>  <br>  2. The credit crisis, that was ALL democrat, or almost, with the help of a very few Republican idiots. The community reinvestment act forced, yes, FORCED banks to lend to bad risk individuals, by regulation pushed by DEMOCRATS. That was the problem. Then democrats in charge of Freddy Mac and Fannie Mae (Reins and Gorelick (of the Clinton Gorelick Wall), both Clinton people), appointed to these positions who gave big money to democrats from quasi-governmental agencys Obama got more than anyone during his time in Senate, and Dodd and Frank, who covered Fanny and Freddie with help of Waters, Reid and other democrats when Bush wanted to regulate them and stop them from running amok as they were back in 2005. Freddy and Fanny misrepresented their mortgage backed securities backed by those bad loans as government backed, but they lied. They also made around 90 million each including the bonuses they got for selling all those bad packages by fraud, but no one is even talking prosecution for this fraud which was over 1000 X worse than Enron and pretty much lead to the banking trouble with bad assets causing insolvency, which lead to the credit crisis.<br>  <br>  Other than those 2 deals the democrats caused nearly all by themselves, the economy was doing very well.

How can I tell?<br>  <br>  Dr. Paul: Can you move it still?<br>  <br>  You: Yeah. But it hurts to move it.<br>  <br>  Dr. Paul: (examines your hand) Is it a shooting pain?<br>  <br>  You: No. It’s just really sore.<br>  <br>  Dr. Paul: You just need some rest. You worked the muscles too hard. Try to not use it as much for awhile. These things take time to heal.<br>  <br>  You: That’s it? Do nothing?<br>  <br>  Reid: No. He’s not saying do nothing.<br>  <br>  Dr. Paul: Yes. That’s exactly what I’m saying.<br>  <br>  Reid: Doing nothing would be catastrophic. His hand might fall off within a month or even a week if we do nothing.<br>  <br>  Dr. Paul: The soreness was caused by too much exercise. Less exercise and strain on the muscles is the only way to solve the problem.<br>  <br>  Reid: The soreness is good. It’s the only way to strengthen the muscles. What you need to do is play through the pain. Exercise even more!<br>  <br>  You: But it hurts to exercise. I don’t want to exercise anymore. I want it to stop hurting.<br>  <br>  Reid: You hear that Nancy? Refusal to exercise.<br>  <br>  Pelosi: But there will be no muscle growth without continuing to exercise.<br>  <br>  Dr. Paul: Muscle growth takes time. You don’t want to try and grow them too fast.<br>  <br>  Reid: Steroids.<br>  <br>  You and Dr. Paul: What?<br>  <br>  Reid: What you need is steroids. We will pump you full of $700 Billion dollars worth or steroids.<br>  <br>  Dr. Paul: That won’t solve the problem. It will only make it worse.<br>  <br>  Pelosi: (sticks you in the *** with a needle and injects you) There is the first half.<br>  <br>  You: Ouch. That hurt.<br>  <br>  Pelosi: But is your hand better?<br>  <br>  You: No. My hands not better. I just have another pain in my ***.<br>  <br>  Dr. Paul: I told you.<br>  <br>  Reid: It’s because you still need to exercise more.<br>  <br>  You: No. I think I am going to listen to Dr. Paul on this one, and just take it easy for awhile.<br>  <br>  Pelosi: That would waste perfectly good steroids.<br>  <br>  You: I didn’t want the steroids!<br>  <br>  Dr. Paul: The kid doesn’t need steroids. Rest and relaxing is the only cure. We need to do nothing to solve this problem.<br>  <br>              Reid and Pelosi whisper amongst themselves.<br>  <br>  Pelosi: We have a new solution.<br>  <br>  You: Should you consult Dr. Paul?<br>  <br>  Reid: We don’t need Dr. Paul. We’re the majority.<br>  <br>  You: Shouldn’t you ask what I want?<br>  <br>  Pelosi: Hey! Listen up. We won the election, so we decide how to deal with this. Harry get the saw.<br>              Harry exits.<br>  <br>  You and Dr. Paul: Get the what?<br>  <br>              Harry returns with a hack-saw.<br>  <br>  You: What are you going to do with that?<br>  <br>              Nancy Pelosi begins to tie you down.<br>  <br>  Reid: We have discussed the issue with other Doctors, and have reached the conclusion that we need to amputate.<br>  <br>  Nancy Pelosi sticks Dr. Paul with a needle full of sedatives and he falls unconscious to the floor.<br>  <br>  You: Why did you do that?<br>  <br>  Pelosi: He would have just protested, and tried to stop us. This is far too important an issue to let a minority opinion get in the way of progress.<br>  <br>  You: What are you going to do?<br>  <br>  Reid: The pain is in your hand, so we need to get ahead of the problem. You refuse to continue to work out and grow the muscle even after we gave you steroids, so we have decided that it’s in your best interest if we cut off your arm and give it to someone else who will put it to good use.<br>  <br>  You: That’s crazy!<br>  <br>  Pelosi: Crazy situations call for crazy measures.<br>  <br>  You: But it’s my ARM!<br>  <br>  Reid: You’re not using it right now.<br>  <br>  You: But I’ll use it in the future. It’s just my hands a little sore.<br>  <br>  Pelosi: We can’t wait. We have to do something now. We must continue to grow muscles or we will all end up weaker.<br>  <br>  You: But I’ll lose my arm!<br>  <br>  Reid: Well, maybe not.<br>  <br>  You: You’re not going to cut it off?<br>  <br>  Reid: No. We are still going to cut it off, but we have a theory.<br>  <br>  You: What theory?<br>  <br>  Pelosi: It’s untested, but we believe that if we cut off your arm, and give it to someone else who will continue to use it, then the muscles will continue to grow, and eventually you will grow another arm.<br>  <br>  You: THAT’S IMPOSSIBLE!<br>  <br>  Reid: I agree it’s improbable, and our methods are untested, but we feel that even if you don’t regrow your arm, that it is still better for continued muscle growth if we let someone else use it.<br>  <br>  You: So, you are telling me that I may never get it back?<br>  <br>  Pelosi: Anything is possible, but when we are dealing with things like muscle growth and hand pain, it’s important that we do something.<br>  <br>  Reid: Inaction looks bad. We were elected for change, and we have to convince everyone that we are trying to solve this.<br>  <br>  You: But Dr. Paul already solved it! I’m supposed to do nothing.           <br>  <br>        Reid begins to lower the saw onto your arm.<br>  <br>  Reid and Pelosi: We can’t do nothing. Nothing is not an option.<br>  <br>  You: SOMETIMES IT’S BETTER TO DO NOTHING, ESPECIALLY IF YOUR PROPOSED SOLUTION WILL ONLY MAKE THE PROBLEM WORSE!<br>  <br>        They ignore you.<br>  <br>  ht|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	Tell Ron Paul to handle it for me.

If the banks don't want to lend, the fed can always lend directly to the people and bypass the banks.<br>  <br>  Use HUD and bailout money to buy foreclosed homes instead of giving the money to the banks or buying credit swaps.  It's estimated that 6 million homes will foreclose by 2012. The average home is worth less than $290,000.  If the unemployment of the U.S. reaches 9%, that means just over 1 million families might be homeless.  The cost to give 1.5 million families homes would be $435 billion or about 3/4 the cost of the first bailout and not only would that buy homes for the new homeless, but all the homeless.  To buy every house  that is foreclosed and will be foreclosed till 2012 would cost less than the $2 trillion the feds just gave away without oversight.  HUD alone has enough money this year to buy 100,000 $300,000 houses.<br>  <br>  I would drop the department of educations and the department of health and human services and use the money to put the 20 million U.S. citizens that are in households making less than $50,000 a year on Medicaid.  Obama qupted 46 million uninsured Americans, but the study he cited listed 10 million of those as illegal aliens and 17 million are in households making $50,000 or more.  That leaves that 20 million which would then be insured.<br>  <br>  I'd drop the DOJ and use that money to build prisons.  The DOJ is given enough money to build enough prisons per year to house 200,000 inmates.  That would require construction workers and then prison guards and other people working at the prisons.<br>  <br>  I would turn welfare/unemployment to workfare.  The money spent for 2009 alone is like giving 10 million people $40,000 a year jobs.  So when I need warm bodies for anything I'd be grabbing it from this pool.<br>  <br>  I would spend $1 trillion (over a 5 year period) on infrastructure.  That's about how much is needed to really update the U.S.'s crumbling infrastructure.   That amount might be less by using people on welfare/unemployment.<br>  <br>  So I've ended homelessness, gave everyone healthcare to every American that couldn't afford to get their own, bought all the bad credit swaps, fixed the U.S. infrastructure and ended the credit crunch and did it by less new spending since the bailouts since early 2008 when everone got those stimulus checks.

This is the bottom line.<br>  <br>  The credit quotas has to be tightened up, because free-for-all credit is a big contributor to the current problem.<br>  <br>  People have to pay off their current debts, so jobs is also a priority.<br>  <br>  The abortion issue should be put on the back burner.  (It's currently at the fore-front because action is being taken on it).<br>  <br>  Given the above...<br>  a)  Cut taxes for US businesses that create jobs.<br>  b)  Put oversight on lending, and repeal the CRA to tighten credit quotas.  This will help stem future defaults.<br>  c)  Give credit to US businesses based on sound business plans.  No (complete) business plan, no credit.  This would stimulate business growth responsibly and provide jobs.<br>  d)  Don't Nationalize banks!  This is one of the biggest reasons for the stock market decline.  England is starting it, and investors are thinking it is a real threat for the US.<br>  e)  Offer millions of dollars in prizes for companies who can develop key industry technology.  Investors will invest in companies who have a good shot at achieving success.  This has worked in the space vehicle program and robotics already.  (I'd be generous in this area.)

I would've let AIG crash.  I would've let Motor City crash.  I don't know if anyone has told you (rhetorically) yet but these industries are in about seven trillion dollars of debt.  We as tax payers were nice enough (as if we had a choice) to give them about a trillion dollars all-in-all.  That is just a tease when you are in that much debt and you will bankrupt anyways.  Get it?  So, we basically inserted a trillion or so into the economy when the industry is going to crash anyways and go bankrupt.  Obviously, it is so the CEO's and major shareholders can benefit due to paying themselves large salaries and withdrawling their money before they go down as these people are lobbyists, politicians and members of congress.<br>  <br>  What would I do to fix the economic crisis?  I would just wait it out and let the market set itself.  If anyone paid attention, they would have made the observation that it's a double-edged sword:  You do nothing and it crashes.  You do something and it crashes.  I would rather do nothing and atleast have less National debt that will never be paid back.<br>  <br>  Obviously, this was in the grand scheme to turn the US into a socialist state, as we are now "half in; half out."|`|2KNzw0Rbaa	Not a republican.<br>  Since the economy has been at an artificially inflated level due to poor government policies (CRA, CFTA, among others) and the meddling of the Federal Reserve manipulating interest rates, first would be to eliminate the Fed.

To try to maintain the artificially inflated economic levels would require more and more funds. <br>  <br>  What will happen when the economy 'recovers' following the current course of action? Home loans will not be cheap, more fees, higher interest, stricter guidelines, and large down payments will effectively price millions out of the market (remember, prices have been propped up by the policies) thus demand will fall dramatically and prices will once again collapse.

If people panic and cause a run on the banks, then they will cause a crisis themselves.  More information needs to get out to assure people.  Obama loves hearing his own voice so he should add this one in and shut up with the lies.<br>  <br>  Iran is not an immediate threat.  They are surrounded by military bases and they are pretty well controlled.  We have other threats like N Korea and Russia along with others.  They were just waiting for Obama to be elected.  People think the world cheered because they were so pleased with him.  Like naive little children they thought the world will just love him and want to get along.  <br>  <br>  He needs to increase defense spending not cut it.  He has put us back to levels we haven't seen since before WWII.  That will leave us even more vulnerable than what Clinton did.  We had six attacks under Clinton and 9-11 was due to being unprepared after Clinton cut defense so drastically.  Obama has cut it even more.  You can figure it out yourself what will happen.<br>  <br>  It is very hard to believe that some people continue to refuse to believe the truth.  As if they can't do the math or think logically.  I don't know what it will take for them to wake up out of this dream state but it will be a rude awakening.

And don't say humans, because there are a lot of people who would be discriminated against because they love animals or objects.  Objectophiles fall in love with inanimate objects.  Should they be allowed to marry their toaster?  Or how about someone who wants to be married to fifteen others and wants the same benefits for all of his/her spouses?  <br>  <br>  Precedence in the U.S. is that marriage is a legal union between a man and a woman.  That's where the line is.  Moving it after 200+ years would make a really gray area that would soon kill the whole concept of marriage.<br>  <br>  Sure, let them have civil unions, let them call each other their spouses, wives, husbands or whatever, but an actual marriage?  No.  And believe me, I understand that there are committed gay couples out there who are lifetimers, but unfortunately, opening the can of worms for them opens it for every other form of "marriage" out there.|`|LcAiHBsaaa	I don't have a problem with someone being gay. Not at all. You can do whatever the hell you want. Who am I to judge? HOWEVER; If gay "marriage" were to be passed it would completely eliminate the original meaning and purpose of marriage between a man and a woman to procreate. So I'm not for gay marriage. HOWEVER...I do think that gay couples should have the same legal rights as married couples. My solution, (And I'm no political expert in any way.) would be to have the gay community work towards having their civil unions federally recognized. If their unions were to be federally recognized, they would receive every benefit a married couple does, without infringing on any church/state/marriage issues.<br>  <br>  Actually, Racism is... blahhhhh... Most would agree that the main purpose of marriage is to procreate, hence the focus on it being a man and woman that enter into that contract.

Tobacco growers are highly subsidized by your government, and millions and billions if not trillions spent by your FDA in regulating the production of tobacco products. <br>  <br>  What budgets are built, rebuilt, cycled through, and renewed with conventional annual increase? And what tobacco related illnesses are put to the laboratory in which pharmaceutical industries, subsidized by FDA and government, and what range of nearly useless peripheral medicines are laid out on your Walmart shelves as a result of those outlays and for the purpose of profit out of your wallets? And how much tobacco is exported for profit well out of reach of the FDA, but only after taxed for export? And what tobacco industry and pharmaceutical industry corporate income taxes further build your federal and state budgets - yet beyond the state and federal sales tax revenues gleaned of consumers?<br>  <br>  Your government. Your rich class corporate government is the tobacco dealer you are unable to pinpoint right under your noses. Always has been – and your government got their start by blaming England for TEA? Forget Obama. A dealer is a dealer.<br>  <br>  And since when have you let anyone tell you what or what not to do?? The "warning label" advertising gimmicks further rip you off. How much government budget is allocated for these useless ads? Who funds those massive advertising budgets? Who pays for those ads?? And who profits???<br>  <br>  Any day now... Any day now...

The office of the President is an office of respect, PERIOD!!!! I do not have to like or love who is in there but he/she or who ever is in there at the time, is the President of the United States of America.

I did not vote for President Obama but like I said the people have spoken and like a true American and as a Vet of 2 wars I support our President and his office 100 percent damned with what party he/she is in. That is, in my opinion is what being a true American is all about.<br>  <br>  Edit update: I am for free speech and I am for speaking up but there is a difference between bashing with rumors that are not backed up and downgrading the office of the President to get an audience and both party's do just that.

Palin kicked McCain to the side. It's all about her and 2012!!|`|YupMCYHlaa	First of all, I don't think McCain personally chose Palin. We always hear that the presidential candidate picks his own running mate, but I think usually the person is selected by a party committee, and the candidate is given credit so he can look 'presidential'.<br>  <br>  You have to remember McCain was behind in the polls, and things were getting desperate. Obama's numbers were rising quickly throughout the Democratic Convention.  The Repubs wanted to pick someone who would become the big story, distract the press from their fascination with Obama.  And Palin certainly was that!  Even the announcement of her selection was timed for greatest impact, on the day after Obama's acceptance speech to a packed football stadium.  She -did- distract the press!  Everyone loved her!  Until she opened her mouth.<br>  <br>  Plus, the Religious Right had never really liked McCain.  So the VP pick had to bring them back into the camp.  And that worked too.  The fundamentalists loved Palin.<br>  <br>  Now the GOP is in big trouble and they know it.  The party leaders know their party's 'brand' has been severely damaged by Bush, and they need to generate a new image for the party, a new face.  But they're not all in agreement as to which way to go.  Michael Steele was picked to give the party a more moderate image, more inclusive, less intolerant and mean-spirited.  But he came off second-best in his first skirmish with Rush Limbaugh, the head of the mean-spirited faction.  Rush is now in charge, leading the party off a cliff.<br>  <br>  2012 is a LONG way off.  It will be interesting to see how this works out.  If the GOP keeps going the way it's going, it risks becoming only a regional party, popular only with Southern white males.|`|aVEVchFxaa	Leave the old coot alone. He has 'oldtimers disease'.

The academy (any of them) require a commitment to service for a minimum of years- but I believe they cover the cost of your schooling while there- part of why you have to sign with that branch of the military- not just any. You go to Colorado Springs, you go AF; West Point, you go Army; Annapolis, you go Navy/Marine Corps. And the rank you start at varies based on your MOS, past enlistment, years signed on for, major in college, and past college experience.

Una ventina di donnette che sanno benissimo a che ora e` la S. Messa. Invitai il parroco a considerare un cambio di usanze, nel rispetto degli altri 1.500 paesani. L'orologio lo hanno tutti, l'orario e` conosciuto, ecc. Niente da fare. Il parroco diceva che dipendesse solo da lui, lo farebbe volentieri un cambiamento, ma temeva lo scandalo ( la perdita anche della fede. Bella fede !),che dava alle anime. Gli dissi che guidare le anime era appunto il suo importante ruolo, e non solo fare quello che una volta faceva il sagrestano, senza riflettere. Anche in Giappone i missionari sono riusciti a farsi odiare a volte per queste insulse pratiche che sconfessano la bonta` del Dio che predicano: possibile che Dio sia cosi`chiassoso ed incurante delle orecchie del suo popolo. Io dicevo al parroco: non in commotione Dominus ( il Signore non e` nel frastuono!). Nulla da fare. Il cambio di mentalita` lo devono fare loro, i parroci, che ancora si credono la prima o seconda autorita` in paese, e a cui sono affidate tutte le pecorelle, credenti e non credenti.|`|49d10f9ad27a582ba54ea8b13e043f6daa	NEL MIO PAESE SUONA OGNI MEZZ'ORA: CONSOLATI!!!<br>  CMQ DOVREBBERO FARLE SUONARE MENO SENZA ABOLIRLE..|`|65db43d9520a3ffc1624592a5b2b5c64aa	Potrebbero ogni tanto cambiar genere di musica|`|9e1990214192bd994c617ba2af9c2321aa	io non le sopporto! vorrei proprio abolirle! mi fanno venire un mal di testa allucinante! e poi mi fanno diventare triste appena le sento!!!!!!!!!!!|`|e14de0ba454b00de5f563e41ebf0e328aa	Concordo, i fedeli potrebbero lasciare il numero di cellulare al parroco e quando è l'ora della messa gli fa uno squillo.|`|f631798672a19792f1ad9ee2991058a7aa	Ma dove vivi? 6/7 volte è troppo ,  di solito suonano 3 volte al giorno , qui da me  hanno anche spostato l'ave Maria del mattino alle 7 x nn disturbare.|`|4734e8d9d027223b9547b150282333fdaa	io non sono del tutto contro...in fondo questa è anche una tradizione...non capisco xkè bisogna abolirla!! magari guarda ti posso capire se suonano anche in piena notte allora no ma di giorno non è bruttissimo sentirle...dai è anche un modo x scandire la giornata...personalmente mi piace sentirle soprattutto a mezzogiorno...poi boh forse sono io all'antica....(aggiungo che non sono credente ma certe cose fanno parte della nostra cultura e volenti o nolenti le dobbiamo accettare...xkè dobbiamo fare gli atei distruttori a spron battuto??) non tutto ciò che viene dalla religione cattolica è da distruggere....ci sono moltissime cose che non condivido ma in fondo molti valori che per noi oggi sono classificabili come buon senso secoli fa neanche erano concepiti come la solidarietà la fratellanza l'uguaglianza....ma forse sto uscendo fuori tema.........è che certi discorsi non si possono affrontare a quest'ora della notte........|`|480d1da50565f061b01729ad7c4a359baa	anch'io sono d'accordo ad abolirle...tanto chi vuole andare in chiesa lo sa quando deve andare...non vanno perchè suona la campana, ci andrebbero comunque.<br>  dove si firma la petizione??|`|79a3c0fe9d166375552c0214a7884466aa	nervosetto?<br>  turbano le tue masturbazioni mentali?<br>  non è che nei pressi di casa tua c'è anche qualche gallo che osa turbati con il suo chicchirichì?<br>  magari poi ti sollazzi(perchè fà figo) quando ti fanno sentire una campana tibetana,ascoltale fanno lo stesso effetto.<br>  ciao|`|8eba73781c7baa983cf0b49ccc46bd66aa	No,abolizione dei campanacci,piuttosto..??|`|f82cbcaa5655aaa03cb4c901b3a59b01aa	da me suonano 3 volte al giorno e spesso mi sono utili perchè regolano la giornata... anche qui prima suonavano più spesso e ad alto volume quindi credo che tu possa riuscire a risolvere il tuo problema

8a1f596fcf10c4448c36abaa152d761faa	Existen diversas maneras de responder tu cuestionamiento.<br>  <br>  1.- Tienen que hacerlo porque son ilegales, si no lo fueran, no habría necesidad de hacerlo. El primer requisito para legalizar es ese, precisamente, pues, ?cómo legalizarían lo legal? Ahora, para evitarse ese afán de legalizar, solamente reformen la legislación y así, todo lo ilegal que pueda ser la estadía en Norteamérica, dejará de serlo por ese solo hecho.<br>  <br>  2.- No TIENEN que hacerlo... DEBEN hacerlo, eso en razón de que sería legitimar una estadía que es tolerada con conocimiento de causa (porque les conviene pues) y porque es humano hacerlo. Al no realizar reformas migratorias, persisten en el absurdo de necesitar a los mexicanos y mantenerlos en la clandestinidad, haciendo de las víctimas villanos y de los villanos víctimas, solo por decreto.<br>  <br>  3.- En sentido estricto, no tienen que legalizar a los mexicanos. Nadie es ilegal por decreto, de hecho, la existencia humana, su género o su raza, es ilegal per se; ello en congruencia con la Declaración de los Derechos del Hombre y del Ciudadano firmada por los Estadounidenses desde 1766, la Declaración Universal de los Derechos Humanos en 1948 y el Pacto de San José desde 1978. Lo que son ilegales son los actos... ?cuáles actos? Los actos de los que, reconocidos como residentes en USA, contratan a trabajadores coterráneos o de otros países en condiciones vulnerables, para pagarles menos y exigirles más, con el amago de su pretendida "ilegalidad".<br>  <br>  Por lo que, desde cualquier perspectiva, la conducta ilegal es la que en lugar de reivindicar al ser humano como tal, independientemente de su condición o circunstancia, lo discrimina y se aprovecha de ello económica, social y políticamente. Deberían sentirse afortunados los norteamericanos que tienen la oportunidad de legalizar sus propias actitudes para con el resto de los habitantes del mundo.<br>  <br>  Saludos.|`|5e5c849f9947688dcf5bcf7491202154aa	repasa la istoria y se humilde|`|a5e5b5cdba4f046676e1f7190f3887c0aa	para no estar tan ignorantes y pedantes como usted.|`|b511abc4dfc1a96fc368b774805b4d83aa	Seras ,Mrs Bush, seras la pulga q les pica a los legisladores en Washigton ?, eso de tenemos no te huele a manada?,seguro aparte de q no pagas impuestos "zangano" escupes para arriba para q te caiga en la cara,sigue viviendo del "sistema" q te pagan los "mojados" con sus impuestos q pagan al trabajar y consumir en este grandioso pais, no se te olvide q mi abuelo esperaba ya a tu abuela cuando cruzo de ilegal por esa frontera.|`|c50f17e9e04b5d64ca0ed9570973366caa	No tienen porque.....pero no le queda de otra....es parte del plan que tenemos todos los mexicanos para recuperar el territorio que nos fue quitado en epoca de Santa Anna......y ya lo dijo mi amigo FECAL "Ni tan alta la barda ni tan grande el brinco; un mendigo brinquito; no habra barda que nos detenga" o algo asi, pal caso es lo mismo.....asi que, en conclusion, te recomiendo que dejes de preocuparte y mejor preparate bien, pero en serio bien, estudia mucho,porque ahora con el triunfo de FECAL no solo se van a ir campesinos, tambien nos vamos a ir los profesionistas bilingues y voy por tu empleo por menos dinero y mas horas de trabajo......<br>  <br>  Saludos y nos vemos pronto !!|`|9928b3f7cd43d57838263e6ae5d6670eaa	Porque así acaban con la evasión de impuestos<br>  Estudia el esquema fiscal de Estados Unidos y entenderás.|`|c96d69a99783c1e684151db39314e851aa	porque sino su economia se cae|`|5e38d0df9d464fbb56515afc8b560441aa	Orale, que cosas, tienes el poder de legalizar, no seas cruel, legalisame unos cuantos, soy pollero.

ZOXoPgJbaa	U.S. didnt join the war against Hitler until the Russians had the Germans retreating. We provoked Japan into war with us. They really had no choice with the embargoes and all the other nasty things Roosevelt did to them. Plus Australia warned us about the Japs coming our way, and FDR sat on his hands and waited until we were attacked. Before the attack about 80% of the population wanted no part of the war. How can you send Americans to die against their will. Afterall we are the land of the free arent we?<br>  <br>   Non intervention is the correct way to go. We shouldn't be entangling ourselves in the affairs of other nations. Isnt this why we pay 25% of the funding for the UN anyways?

The Liberal and Progressive Democrats believe first, last and foremost in our sacred Bill of Rights and when it was first penned, NO OTHER COUNTRY in the world had such a document written to protect the individual rights of her citizens.<br>  Also, true Liberal Progressive Democrats believe in, promote and pass laws to enforce the wording of our Declaration of independence that "We Hold These Truths To Be Self-Evident That All Men (Mankind) are Created EQUAL and are Endowed by Their Creator with Certain Inalienable Rights"<br>  And so, we have such a party whose job is to shield us from religious fanatics of the religious right who would force their wills upon the rest of us.  We have such a party to ensure that our lives and liberties are not threatened by tainted food, unsafe products, dangerous chemicals, pollution, the spread of disease, etc.   We have a party that understands that workers and the benefits they earn must be protected by law.<br>  The Democratic Party understands that America's job is not that of World Police, which is what the Germans and Japanese attempted to become 80 years ago!  They value our precious service men and women who come from the ranks of the middle class working families.  And the purpose of our military is to PROTECT US and not set up new dictators all over the world.<br>  So before you consider a third party, ask yourself which party has promoted social and civil liberties, worker protections, personal choice in birth control, employment and educational advances for minorities....ask who is actually living up to the ideal that we're all created equal and deserve an equal chance?<br>  Our Constitution was made to set our personal liberties in place and then, to be used as a tool to expand them for all of us.  Everyone deserves the same fair chance to have an education, a job and equal protection.<br>  Now, every once in awhile, you get some lunatic who is living on our soil who doesn't want to pay taxes or do his part to make sure that the government can provide the necessary tools we have given it to safeguard us.  OK.  That's fair.  But tell this lunatic to shut his pie-hole and pay his taxes if he wants to live here in guaranteed freedom or pack a bag and get the hell out of our country!

It's as simple as that.<br>  <br>  Still others are taking jobs "Americans don't want," sending all the illegal foreigners back to Mexico.  Isn't it unfair?  Previously unemployed Americans are now STEALING American jobs from illegal Mexicans.  That's just horrible.

I'm German, but I settled down in Thailand, where the banking crisis from America hits the country pretty bad now. It's very scary, because you don't have something like a social system. Americans play the world police, and 'take' other countries to receive cheap oil. If there'd be a real Superman, not even Superman could help this country. School systems are different in each State, also the laws. They're not using the metric system, because they're so special? America wake up, and don't give other countries your problems.

Credit card companies would cease to exist and lots of small businesses depend on them to buy the tools they need to do business.

This is one of many to come.|`|3caq6SFxaa	The answer about not applying to private hospitals is correct but any hospital getting money for providing emergency care to the uninsured or by treating MediCare patients will be which all the hospitals except those catering to the very wealthy.  This is another of the misnamed bills that the title reads one way and the actual bill is designed another; no freedom of choice here but forcing doctors to do some thing against their beliefs and in many cases against the medical oath in their opinion.  The local Catholic hospital does not do routine abortions but will provide free transportation the three miles to another hos ital that does; medically necessary abortions are a different matter and they will and always have performed those.  I am a supporter of choice to a degree but then does not that mean you should not force people to do things against their will also?  The other misnamed bill is the open choice union bill that takes away secret balloting; what makes any one think that will be fair when people have or will worry about repercussions from the union if they don't say Yes-employers are restricted from taking action against pro union or un organizers they employee by another law but the unions are not.  Since the stated purpose of the maw is to make unionizing effort easier and increase union membership tell me what is  fair and impartial about it.  Both bills are bad bills and a woman needing or wanting and abortion has that choice but they should not force any hospital they choose to go to perform it.  So any church that makes a statement about politics should lose tax exempt status-that takes all the black churches that endorsed President Obama, ACORN is a tax exempt organization that endorses candidates and take very political stands plus get federal money so they are gone also, every organization in the US will make a statement about what they believe should not be tax exempt in your opinion?

xxDjV6Axaa	No lawyer is going to advertise that.  They decide on a case by case basis.  So you might have to consult with several before you find one who will take the case and take payments.  If you have a good down payment for the retainer, that will help a lot.  Then you need to show good faith that you will pay it back.  I'm sorry to put it this way but most criminals are not honest.  Lawyers can lose money by trusting the wrong person.<br>  <br>  So if you have a job, can make large payments each month, and have good credit, someone will allow it.  By large payments I mean if the total is $3,000, the payments should be at least $500 a month.  Lawyers will not set up $50 payments over a few years.|`|AA10780838	I don't know any Criminal Defense lawyer who will work without a retainer (that means the money up front) and this is for a good reason.

You would have to have the father prepared to watch her for maybe 6mos while that happened.<br>  <br>  After that, you will serve the weekend each month and 2 weeks training each year.  You would have college money available to you right away and there may even be a signing bonus available after you finish school.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that the reserves can deploy just as easily as active duty, so you and the others involved in your daughter's care will need to be prepared for that possibility.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you have a reasonably good relationship with her father, and he may be willing to work with you.  Talk to a few recruiters and talk openly with your family and ex to make sure everyone is on board.  You may be able to schedule time for your father to visit with your daughter while you are gone and ease your mind about the care she is receiving.<br>  <br>  I am only familiar with the Army, but I hear that the Air Force has great programs for families and good benefits as well.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA10709853	as a single parent you cannot enlist AD at ALL.   you may not give up custody just to enlist and you may not regain custody while on your first term of enlistment.

Talk to the others involved, talk to recruiters from all of the different branches, and make an informed decision.  If you're going to do it, doing it before she's much older might be best because you'll be out by the time she's going to miss you even more if you wait until she's older.<br>  <br>  No matter what you decide, get someone to give you a huge hug for thinking of being a responsible mother and trying to better yourself.

If you have joint custody of a child by court order, and you do not have a spouse (who is not considered a spouse for enlistment standards), you are considered a single parent.

You may be able to do reserves and still get the educational benefits without going active duty in which case you would be gone one weekend a month and deployed two weeks out of the year. I suggest talking to your local recruiter about this.<br>  <br>  Also the if you try to give up custody for the sole purpose of going into the Air Force will render you permanently disqualified as it is not there intention to make you give up custody of your child. If you go into your recruiters office and say you have given up custody they make you sign a form stating that you did not do it to enlist in the air force and that you have no intention of regaining custody of your child after you enlist. <br>  <br>  I personally will say this to you as a dependent of a Navy dad it is definitely not a good environment for a single parent as you are gone a lot. My dad was gone on deployments for 6 months to 9 months sometimes longer. You are property of the military. I joined the Navy and am glad that I do not have dependents or a spouse to worry about. <br>  <br>  Again the only option I see available to you is the Reserves but I would definitely go down to your local recruiter as they would have tons of information for you. I know that with the Navy you get enlistment bonuses and all that for joining including the G.I. Bill!<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and what you decide! I'm glad you are responsible in your choice to raise your daughter as my mom abandoned me and my two sisters when we were one, two and three and never looked back.
AA11253664	are you kidding me? You want to leave canada to come here? Canada has a higher life expenctancy, better quality of education, health care, etc...think about it....|`|U9bQgfY9aa	You have to have a university degree that qualifies you for a "TN Visa".

Statutory rape against a 8-year-old is an egregious crime worthy of the harshest penalties the law can render (and worse, if I were in charge -- Death penalty means no more molesting for that convict).|`|BK2ammwzaa	To get specific information about this it's best to contact a specialist service in your area.

That makes no sense, people on disability do not work at any career or job. Did someone getting disability make you mad and now you somehow believe they should not be getting anything and think its like getting a bonus for nothing and they should be working, not collecting disability or they made a career in your mind collecting disability and it is like a bonus collecting disability in the first place when they should not be getting anything, but still working?

9wXzRZwdaa	63B is a decent job in the military you will see some conficting things in the army as a 63 B mainly civilian mechanics taking over the job over army mechanics everywhere to include stateside and in iraq but there still is alot of work to do and trucks to fix a 63B is no longer a  light wheel mechanic now it is a wheeled vehicle mechanic it used to be 63B was light wheel and 63S was heavy wheel but they took out all 63S and made em 63B i know i was a 63S.  As far as iraq or any war zone depends on who you go over there with or are attached to if something breaks down yes you have to quick recover it on the road and no your not often getting shot at while doing it the 2 years i was in iraq there were plenty of convoys i was on you cant always fix it on the spot you dont have every part on hand in convoys to fix anything usually what you will do is hook it up to the wrecker (tow vehicle) and keep trucking to your destination and fix it when you get there but thats myself.  When i was in Iraq most of the mechanics never went anywhere but the sleep area and the motorpool i would say it is one of the safer jobs in the military.  As far as your ASE certification goes no you dont get certified in the military but you can take the tests at a price of zero dollars if you would like to and i would recommend that you do that when it is time to come close to getting out of the Army so that way you are not leaving with expired certification and have to renew it back at full pricing again after you are out good luck and i hope i helped you with your decision and hope to see you in the motorpool :)
4RB0Odxjaa	Hey there,<br>  <br>  I just joined the Navy and I have about 6000 in debt for medical bills, credit cards, etc... I'm not proud of what my parents did but I'm dealing with it. All of my debt is in collections and Im working hard to figure out how to pay it off. All I had to do was fill out an affidavit like form stating what the debt was, what I'm doing to get it paid off, and why it occurred and the dates of the occurrences. After that your golden it was pretty easy. I swore in and I leave for basic April 7th. <br>  <br>  As for your next question here is what I found about what they look for in the information for security clearance in the military:<br>  The adjudicator considers the following factors when evaluating an individual’s conduct:<br>  <br>      * The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct<br>      * The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation<br>      * The frequency and recency of the conduct<br>      * The individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct<br>      * The voluntariness of participation<br>      * The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes<br>      * The motivation for the conduct<br>      * The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and<br>      * The likelihood of continuation of the conduct.<br>  <br>  Also these will get you denied immediatly:    1. An individual has been convicted in any court of the U.S. of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.<br>     2. An individual is (currently) an unlawful user of, or is addicted to, a controlled substance (as defined in section 102 or the Controlled Substances Act (21U.S.C. 802))<br>     3. An individual is mentally incompetent, as determined by a mental health professional approved by the DoD<br>     4. An individual has been discharged or dismissed from the armed forces under dishonorable conditions. <br>  <br>  Found on <a href="http://usmilitary.about.com/cs/generalinfo/a/security2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://usmilitary.about.com/cs/generalin...</a><br>  <br>  This discusses the different clearances available and what you need. I'm just going to say honesty is the best policy. Go in and talk to your recruiter and explain everything as long as your honest they are more apt to help you. Lie and they will not help you!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|pDu3kBuvaa	I had a repossession of a car but I was making good on paying back the difference I owed and was granted a Top Secret clearance in the AF.  Just keep on paying off the loans and you should be fine. Since your shoplift occ when you were a minor you should be fine.|`|3tg9iXJIaa	This is something you are going to have to discuss with your recruiter. You will not have to worry about a Top Security clearance unless you have a job that dictates to have one. I would finish a degree first and try to go for an Officer job because the pay will be better than enlisted. As long as your are current with your payments it should not be a problem, as far as your offense, I am not sure. If you have not told your recruiter about your offense, you better, because you do not want them to find out after your enlisted. I would still talk to your local recuiter about these issues. Good Luck. I enjoyed my time in, just be smart and manage your money wisely, because the AF keeps checks on that too.
9YOXpVM0aa	If you want to live in Canada, he would have to sponsor you for PR.  Your daughter could have dual citizenship but he will probably have to apply for it proving his Canadian citizenship before your daughter can get hers.  You can ask the embassy about that.  Maybe it's enough that you have your marriage certificate and your daughters birth certificate.  I don't suppose you have a copy of his birth certificate or passport, if you did, that would help.  If your daughter gets Canadian citizenship, that will not help you go to Canada but she can go when she is older.  When she is grown up, she could sponsor you to go there too.|`|GFOdY3nBaa	your daughter can, when she turns 18, you cant. he will have to sponsor your residency to begin with. just because you got  a child from him, doesnt mean you can just come...|`|AA10632060	Leon7g have the right answer for you.

YkZeA3Jvaa	If you believe you can make better decisions than the government as to how to spend your money, then you are a conservative.<br>  <br>  If you believe the government can make better decisions than you can as to how to spend your money, then you are a liberal.|`|vxbzE9hNaa	capitalism: small gov role, tax cuts, free trade, poeple in charge of economy<br>  socialism: big gov. role, big taxes, wealth distirution...|`|1CgK5Le6aa	That first answer oversimplifies it, but isn't false. Political ideologies take many forms, economic science is as valid as science can be. Free market economics are the fastest way of creating wealth, and as the current crises exemplifies, the least stable.<br>  <br>  All governments exist for a reason, to create and maintain a system of upholding societal values, and provide a stable forum for people to live up to said values. Governments, at minimum, provide security for a nation. This includes military and police, to protect against external and internal threats to livelihood. Pretty much every government takes it upon itself to provide infrastructure, and therein lies much debate. Almost everyone accepts their town paving roads and monitoring sewer systems, electrical grids, etc. Questions arise when it comes to things like schooling, firefighters, welfare, scientific research, faith-based initiatives, environmental protection, banking regulations, and a whole host of other issues. <br>  <br>  While one could theoretically classify "conservatives" as those who only want the government providing for security, and "liberals" as those wanting the government to control everything, in reality the closest things to a pure example of either were those of the U.S.S.R., with government control of everything, and Hong Kong (pre-Chinese takeover) with government control of only the police. America lies in the Center.<br>  <br>  I could go on, but you should really research this for yourself.|`|7BJ0YScwaa	They don't. All governements are the same really. The difference between countries and thier political leaders involvement all has to do with the the desire of the public to either have or not have involvement.<br>  Too many people seem to believe government officials are aliens that are not related to the country and have evil macinations.<br>  Every country is like it is because of the people in that country and those peoples desires. The government only makes efforts to guide those desires.<br>  In the US, the desire is to have less government involvement. In China they want more, in France they are almost amalgamated. <br>  China is now the worlds 3rd largest economy and will become the most powerful country in the world and they are not a Democracy! So what? They are not a Democracy, but thier government is also less involved than in say France or Denmark etc...<br>  Point is it's all the same. The difference is the desires of the gen pop because goverments are part of gen pop.<br>  In **** countries where people are oppressed and murder, the people enjoy it. It's tradition in Congo to rape your daughter on her wedding night to break her in. They accept it, it has nothing to do with government. In Russia, the KGB made people dissappear. The gen pop thought that was ok, because they needed security. In the US the gen pop believed stealing people from Africa and forcing them to work under the whip for nothing was good business sense. Today they believe it's ok to invade soveriegn nations.  Believe it or not, whether or not your country is a democracy, theology or dictatorship, they are all versions of the same thing and it's the people who allow the government to rule them.|`|73c9d4fa33559b0b87d0a9b88bc8f2a3aa	Well, any ideology which seeks radical change would require a high degree of central control and authority to affect that change. So pretty much, the bigger the change from the status quo, the more involved the government would be in political and economic activities in order to force through their big changes.

PuFoXSTHaa	I wouldnt worry too much, like you said the police department is nearby and responsive. If you are worrying i would put in a call to the police department saying that you have noticed a white truck driving down the street at ____ (time) of the night, _____ number of times.

But you are being a good lookout neighbor to your neighborhood..|`|ox7mJ2Psaa	people work odd shifts maybe he has a night or early morning job. you can set up a video camera or a motion sensor camera that takes photos of vehicles passing by the court. you can drive around your area and look for the truck as the driver may live within a few blocks or a few miles of your court. you can also ask the police after you get a tag number if the vehicle is stolen or if there is current a "bol" (be on the look out) for a white truck. as in a crime was committed and they are looking for a white truck because one was seen leaving the area at the time of the crime.|`|AA10925759	It could be a number of things.

If police are down the street go in and tell them what is going on, maybe they will park in your court a few times to show a presence that is a big deterrent. also keep outside lights on and inform neighbors that way everyone is on the lookout
VaIYIrRxaa	technically, yes they can. Im sure you have heard the "horror" stories of people getting fined 15 grand or whatever for illegal downloading, but that is mostly for large uploaders (those who post files on the internet to be downloaded.) Once on the internet, files are, basically, open to the public. Bittorrent sites such as pirate bay have been through many lawsuits discussing this very topic, and they have not lost a single one. One thing to maybe be worried about, though, is that there have been rumors that Comcast may flag illegal sites and then cut the internet off to the user once he has visited the site a certain number of times though. As of now though, that is just a rumor and invasion of privacy. You should have nothing to worry about.
2eztcCO0aa	Try Denmark.  They have an excellent social system that takes care of all children and retirees and provides medical for every person.  They pay people what they're worth; a garbage man is paid a comparable salary to those whose garbage he's picking up and may even live in the same neighborhood.  Even their royal family, rich as they are, feel it's necessary to have a profession and be useful.  Their crown prince is a carpenter's assistant.  In Denmark they think it's good for people to socialize, and the government pays their dues so they can join all kinds of clubs.  This is just a few of the good things about living in Denmark.<br>  <br>  I don't know how easy it is to immigrate there, or what their job market is like, but it sure sounds like a nice place to live.|`|Piw6xeiKaa	I was watching Sicko and they were saying that France pays for everything for you. so i would check them out.|`|GTZFpbfPaa	CANADA. we have resources, jobs and a recession not a depression!|`|zEoRcL91aa	So you're migrating like the Wildebeest?

AjPbtm7oaa	Rape is not a sexual deprivation issue. It is an issue of power & violence. Prostitutes are going to solve that unless inmates get to slap them around. Besides that it's a stupid idea.

Have you never heard of masturbation.<br>  <br>  Your question presumes men are incapable of not resorting to rape if they are unable to get sex by other means, assuming men are incapable of controlling their sexual urges and therefore have a legitimate right to rape if this happens.<br>  <br>  If this was so then that would really make males the inferior species, I don't believe that is so but you seem to be suggesting it.|`|zqPjdhgKaa	Rape isn't about sex, its about power and control.  Many prisoners rape other prisoners to show they are more powerful and in control of the other person.  It is degrading and humiliating and they do it for those reasons.  It has nothing to do with being "deprived" of sex.  It would not reduce the amount of rapes occurring in prisons.

a7fd823ff38cea82d01dbcb747972460aa	You didn't mention your age. If you are of a legal age you should file your own law suit but if you are not of legal age the court should have appointed a guardian for your portion of the settlement. Your own law suit could be just as equitable as they did deprive you of a Mother and a Mother's advice during marriage and pregnancy and also there is nothing like a Grandmother's love for your children. You have to think of them too even if you do not have any yet. I would not let this rest. I do know that any settlement he may have received, if you are of a legal age, did not include your cooperation in not litigating further suites. He only settled the matter for himself.<br>  <br>  If you were 15 at the time you should contact the Attorney's office and find out what arrangements were made for your money. If he was the guardian then you may make him show where your money is legally or ask for an itemized statement of where it was spent. Contact the Attorney's office and ask for a copy of the settlement (it will probably cost you but at 15 you would have had to be a part of this suite)|`|AA11767291	As an heir to her estate you were probably entitled to benefit from the suit .

In my mind, this seems selfish and narrow-minded. I would think that logically, by adding the children to the lawsuit, the amount (I would hardly call it a REWARD) would have been increased by quite a bit. <br>  <br>  To answer the second part, are you entitled to any of it, You can access the court records, as they are public knowledge, and if you WERE named as a co-complainant by name or inference, you might have some recourse. Of course this might mean that you have to bring legal action against your Father, and then the only winners are the Lawyers.<br>  <br>  What you might want to do is seek an attorney in your neighborhood, someone whom you are familliar with, and ask them the same question.

My mother died when I was 15 due to a dirty instrument used in surgery.  My father had a law suit filed, but then dropped it without carrying through with it.  I was not happy because I felt that we should make sure they paid for their neglect.<br>  <br>  My Dad did promise my brother and I a fair share of my Mom's life insurance policy to help with College .. However, after about 1.5 years, he had met another woman; married her; and spent the WHOLE thing buying her a new house and furnishings ... My brother and I never received a dime.<br>  <br>  This is where you story and mine differ .. it seems you Dad go through with it and was awarded a settlement.  Unfortunately I do not believe that you are legally entitled to any of the settlement.  It would go 100% to your Father.  You Father most certainly should give you a cut.  I think that if there is any hope for you to get anything it is going to have to come from a friendly, cordial relationship and agreement by the two of you.  If you involve a third party (of any kind .. legal .. relatives .. any) your Dad will probably resent that and clam up and never share a cent since he is not required to.<br>  <br>  How old are you?  If you are under 18, you are legally entitled to Social Security on behalf of your mother until you reach 18 ... NOW, here's the catch on that as well ... it will come to your Dad in his name and is intended to supplement his income to replace your mom's and help support you .. SOO, Unfortunately it is 100% up to him if you get any of that as well.<br>  <br>  I am very sorry for you loss.  I know how difficult it is ... My best suggestion to you is to live your life in such a manner that would make your mom proud. Remember all of the good times and let the not so good times go.  Try to maintain peace with you Dad as you never know if you will need him in the future ... plus, your mom would probably want you to do so.  I also recommend that you pray about this and find happiness in Church.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck.<br>  <br>  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...<br>  <br>  P.S. .... Well, as we might expect on yahoo answers, you are getting conflicting answers ... try this ... go to www.lawguru.com    <br>  and ask your question ..

Someone you can trust, or a lawyer who knows nothing of you or your dad, so there are no strings attached somehow. You tell a lawyer your story ( a family lawyer, I think? ) if he thinks he's got a case ..... and he knows he can win etc.... you wont have to pay him anything upfront, and he would only take a % (you & lawyer agreed upon) after you won your settlement.<br>  <br>  That is if you have a case...which it sounds like you definitely do!!!
xkcLOfTKaa	Speaking from experience... $250k a year for a household is NOT rich!<br>  Perhaps if you are single and have no real debt you could live quite extravagantly... But with kids, mortgage, a $800/mo electric bill (I am NOT kidding, either), 2 car payments, high food prices (for foster kids who act like they have never seen food sometimes), clothes, school supplies, oh man...<br>  <br>  Trust me... You are NOT rich at that point!|`|bJnqYE6maa	No, it doesn't, especially when you consider that you give 35 percent of it to the feds and another 15 to state and local.  Making 250K a year means you make 180K a year, really.<br>  <br>  "A comfortable living" is a relative concept.  What gives anyone a comfortable living is SAVING MONEY...  something that Americans don't seem to be familiar with.|`|1b91ce32a95b13a1e9f83fdedfcea4f9aa	Depends. Just where does this person live? in some areas $250K isn't gonna make you rich but very comfortable. High cost of housing, utilities and insurance could be factors reducing the value of that $250K. But in other areas $250k will make you rich.<br>  Also, if you lived off $25K and received $250K you will feel rich. <br>  And if you are healthy, loved, have friends and happy then you are wealthy.|`|214e1adddf040b774a03079bd09796e3aa	A good deal for a single person.  A family with growing children and paying for children in College or helping with elderly parents make a world of difference.  Putting a figure on something like that will simply penalize some and profit others.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately I never had the opportunity to worry about how to manage 250k a year.<br>  <br>  Oh dear, what a problem that must be to hassle with!|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	If you are single and in a rural area where the cost of living isn't through the roof...you would be well off, but not rich. As a business owner, given that the profit is not take home and much of it goes BACK into the business by way of more products, more jobs, raises, etc. It is NOT rich. If you are a parent and raising children, it's NOT rich. It simply IS NOT RICH. There is no justification for targeting one group to subsidize the rest of the nation. NO....I am not rich. Husband and I have never made that combined. But...for argument's sake (and reallity for those who say  "it's not my problem...I don't make that") let's go with a scenario...<br>  <br>  You worked all of your life and saved up money to start a business. You foot the bill for the permits, licences, etc. You hire people. The government comes along and says YOU MAKE TOO MUCH. They want some of it (A LOT OF IT) to redistribute to others to "be fair". How is this fair? And regarding those that make millions....I have no claim to their money anymore than they have the claim to mine. Saying "they can afford it" is simply not an ETHICAL solution. That is putting a cap on success and innovation. When the cost becomes too high to do business, most businesses move or close up shop. And if I were one of the people who made at least $250K, I would ask for a salary cap so I wouldn't be PUNISHED for it. There isn't much incentive when the government starts taking almost HALF of what you earn. It matters not whether other people deem it hard work or not...you don't know what it took to get there. No one OWES anyone else anything...period.|`|jLxBvXZ5aa	It is not rich by any means.

Keep in mind most people who make that amount also have the increased bills to go with it, so you are always in need of more money.  Not thats it is very smart but that is how most people live.  Now if you made 250K and lived as if you only made 60k then yes you would stock pile a sum of money.|`|SpBAcRJmaa	It is funny that when Obama says he is going to tax people  that make over 200 grand a year the conservatives are all in an outrage, "200 K IS NOT RICH !!!", but these same nitwits get their panties in a wad when guys that make cars make about 80,000.

I|`|t3QAaSN9aa	You are not necessarily rich because you make that kind of income.  Various other factors are important.  You may not have been earning that income for very long. You may also have no assets of any substantial worth and you may be paying back student loans or other debts. You may also be living in a very expensive location, which is often the case when individuals earn high salaries, for instance.  <br>  <br>  This of course has nothing to do with the modest proposed tax increase because individuals who are earning that amount of money, whether rich or otherwise, can afford the slight increase.|`|1oj4aamaaa	It's open to interpretation.

Además, entregará en concesión a particulares, en menor o mayor medida, los servicios médicos de la institución. Todo esto, se nos dice, con el objetivo de recuperar la viabilidad financiera que no tiene en sus actuales condiciones. <br>  <br>  Si aceptamos como cierta la inviabilidad financiera del ISSSTE, sería insensato reprochar al gobierno que tome medidas para quitarse de encima una carga financiera que amenaza con devorarlo. Pero aún así es reprochable que lo haga sin haber negociado con todos los sindicatos afectados por esta medida recién aprobada, ya que sólo pactó con el SNTE de Elba Esther Gordillo y la FSTSE de Joel Ayala, y sin haber explorado seriamente otras opciones de solución que no constituyan, como ésta, un paso más en el desmantelamiento del sistema de seguridad social fundado en la solidaridad. <br>  <br>  Ese camino lo inició el gobierno del ex presidente Ernesto Zedillo y lo continuó Vicente Fox. Zedillo en 1997, cuando quitó al IMSS las cuotas para pensiones de millones de trabajadores en él inscritos y las transfirió a las Administradoras de Fondos Para el Retiro (Afores), propiedad todas ellas de bancos privados. Y Fox en 2004, cuando modificó el régimen de jubilaciones y pensiones de los trabajadores del Seguro Social. <br>  <br>  Con la nueva Ley del ISSSTE, los enormes fondos de ahorro para el retiro de poco más de 2.5 millones de trabajadores al servicio del Estado, cuyo valor estimado es de 58 mil millones de pesos, quedarán en manos de una Afore pública denominada Pensionissste que, pese a las reformas que el Senado promueve para evitar que caiga en manos de grupos políticos o sindicales, estará vinculada de origen a los intereses del sindicato de Elba Esther Gordillo. <br>  <br>  Pensionissste tendrá por tres a?os la exclusividad en el manejo de esos apetitosos fondos de ahorro, lapso después del cual se permitirá su transferencia a las Afores privadas, que acrecentarán así los enormes recursos del ahorro para el retiro de los trabajadores, de los que obtienen por su manejo, desde 1997, jugosas utilidades. <br>  <br>  Pareciera entonces que, así las cosas, lo que se promovió fue una especie de borrón y cuenta nueva respecto a los multimillonarios fondos públicos que debieron destinarse durante a?os a la formación de las reservas técnicas que garantizaran viabilidad al IMSS y al ISSSTE en el sistema de seguridad social fundado en la solidaridad. <br>  <br>  Pero lo peor será cuando en unos a?os más, de seguir las cosas como van, veamos a decenas de miles de trabajadores jubilados verdaderamente empobrecidos. Acaso recordaremos entonces que cuando nuestro país promovía estas reformas iba a contracorriente respecto a la tendencia mundial en materia de pensiones para que el Estado mantenga o vigile el manejo de ese dinero. <br>  <br>  rrodriguezangular@hotmail.com<br>  <br>  el correo es de quien redacto la nota|`|f4b414cc8b0d2434390c8fdd682a9e5faa	Pero no lo permitió ya lo tenia pactado antes de tomar la Presidencia o ?no crees que estas Leyes son negociadas desde mucho antes de las elecciones?<br>  Y si estoy de acuerdo contigo que Calderón lo único que ha hecho es que todo este mas caro, de verdad que como se dice ya no vemos lo duro sino lo tupido|`|pxI3DWyLaa	TU QUE SABES, NO SABES NADA, ERES PURO FILIBUSTERO, YA BAJALE|`|BfpbIKuEaa	Por lo que veo, parece que no estás afiliado al ISSTE, por que no sabes que no tienen a veces ni aspirinas, que los hospitales tienen un mantenimiento pésimo o en muchos casos éste es nulo, que no hay dinero suficiente en el fondo de pensiones siquiera para pagar las pensiones de los ya jubilados. Y ahora dime oh genio seguidor de Fernández Noro?a; de dónde van a sacar dinero para los pensionados si lo recaudado por los trabajadores en activo no alcanza y el gobierno tiene que aportar algunos miles de millones para no dejar sin dinero a miles de burócratas.

Lo único que es una sobredosis de hormonas, que produce náuseas y malestar en la mayoría de mujeres. De modo que con semejante cuadro de estado físico, no creo que a nadie le apetezca mucho tomársela antes.<br>  No es un método anticonceptivo, es decir, actúa después de la fecundación, impidiendo la implantación. Esto para muchos equivale a un aborto. Y los efectos secundarios son horribles, por lo que no se puede usar como anticonceptivo salvo en casos de emergencia, porque trastorna completamente el metabolismo. Para eso ya está la píldora normal, que tiene menos efectos secundarios. Y es más segura.<br>  <br>  La píldora del día después no actúa cuando ya se ha producido la implantación, es decir, después de eso, no aborta.|`|njJfHau4aa	No, se toma el mismo día que vas a tener sexo.|`|q8N6DtJqaa	Nooooooooo???? yo la tenia y dijimos, ya que la tenemos........ y se llama Paula.|`|tfWqwJ0Gaa	bueno la pastilla sirve si es que paso algo alo mejor se rompió el condón de tu novio pero lo que te puedo y ha usado mi novia nosotros tuvimos varias veces sin condón porque ella quería eso y claro cuando me eyaculaba me venia adentro de ella y la pastilla debes tomarla dentro de 72 horas si pasaste esa hora ya no  tendrá efecto por ejemplo si haces ahorita y quieren tener toda la noche el sexo pues mejor tomalo ma?ana así tendrás ya satisfecho, se toma cada 12 horas si tomas a 1 pm debes tomar de nuevo 1am ok y me dice mi chica que da nauseas también tienes ganas de bovitar pero no lo hagas porque si o|`|3b7736285ae7a1c0e6b23b5b7191c1a1aa	Si..<br>  <br>  <br>  plis respondan <a href="http://es.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AonNU3e9XwxQzJ2UgNxaSWBo.gt.?qid=20070407170706AABdZ53">http://es.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|3gylHzSFaa	Mira, hace tiempo, me dieron una platica donde nos comentaron que si compras unas pastillas anticonceptivas (nordet) y te tomas 4 en una sola toma dentro de las 72 horas siguientes al acto sexual y te tomas otras 4 a las doce horas realizan el mismo efecto que esas pastillas.<br>  <br>  Claro que este no debe ser utilizado constantemente solo en caso de posible embarazo.<br>  <br>  Si tu te tomas la primera dosis después de las 72 horas no va a producir efectos.<br>  <br>  Espero que este consejo lo tomes con responsabilidad y mejor optes por buscar un buen método anticonceptivo para evitar en un futuro tener que utilizar esta pastilla.|`|81cd0c6cea2d482dc0f5559922ae5087aa	por si las dudas tomatela antes y después ok? besitos mulita|`|MAoLm87paa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO|`|Tu03AXOFaa	a ver si la cojes que haces primero la metes o la sacas?<br>  usa condón es mas seguro<br>  has lo ante de las comidas así no te perjudica la digestión<br>  por el cu...lo es cien por cien seguro para evitar embarazos no deseados y se goza mas<br>  practica sexo y no la guerra|`|WiDO5H5Yaa	Los cientificos se gastaron el cerebro para lograr este medicamento para el DIA DESPUES, por que las mujeres se olvidaban de tomar los Anticonceptivos y vos queres  QUE LA TOMEN  ANTES|`|e6d5a4f2182bfbebd54221ea553a0b1daa	SI, PERO LA DESCARGA HORMONAL ES TAN GRANDE QUE A TU NOVIA TAL VEZ NO LE DE GANAS DE C O-GER.<br>  MEJOR QUE USE UN PARCHE ANTICINCEPTIVO O CONDóN.<br>  LA DEL SIA SIGUIENTE ES UNA PILDORA ABORTIVA DE EMERGENCIA, NO ES UN ANTICONCEPTIVO DE USO CONVENCIONAL.|`|fE5g7HGCaa	Lo mas peligroso es lo que vayas a hacer el dia despues.|`|m2y8cLSOaa	pienso que si

Una cosa más: fijate a qué velocidad suben los sueldos y a qué velocidad suben los precios, y comparalos…<br>  Y otra cosa, la última: Los docentes últimamente están siendo víctimas de agresiones por parte de algunos padres. Esto es porque algunos padres en vez de castigar a sus hijos cuando traen malas notas o reciben algún castigo por mal comportamiento en la escuela, van e increpan al docente para, bajo amenaza, decirle que lo apruebe. ?A vos te parece que una persona puede vivir así?

SNfscaUhaa	You are 100% correct.I can't understand why we have even given any company money already to rebuild in Iraq when it's being blown up every day.Why not wait until we see what emerges there first.If it's a government that supports terrorism then we don't give them a dime to rebuild.That alone should buy us 100 years of not having to worry about them being a real threat.But if we rebuild now for them that is just fixing things so they can put their money to hurt us.The same holds true for Afghanistan. I would love to see anyone dispute this.Especially Republicans seeing I'm one of those "Bleeding Heart Liberals" everyone loves to bash.|`|8446b0bd7a0c5d7795039d6c92b20599aa	When rebuilding Japan, the main issue of Japan's acceptance of an unconditional surrender was the role of Emperor Hirohito. In essence, he was recognized as semi-divine. So there was a religious issue with Japan, too. When rebuilding nations, all cultures must be respected as it was with Japan. If so-called occupiers can't accept the culture of the nation they have occupied then the occupation is doomed to failure because of popular uprising of the citizens. There is sectarian violence in many areas of the country that the US should avoid, unless our immediate interests are at stake. In the case of Iraq, we should leave. They do not want us there. They should have a right to rebuild their country according to their own culture. It's up to Iraq whether or not to end the civil war and to build up their own forces. In Afghanistan, the Taliban are a different, altogether unpopular sect. They do not have the overall support of the Afghan people because of their cruel treatment of women, the nation's intelligencia, and they are brutal in the punishment of any thing that isn't based on 7th century Islam. We should stay there to stabilize the government because our help and that of the UN peacekeepers have more of a defined role.|`|9ceb8703bde0f3a4c3b8c37576bca3faaa	and who told u that Islamic culture is the problem------i know that Europe and civilized studies came from their studies|`|AA10093905	Right on,just leave.|`|AA11151307	It's not the Islamic culture which is the problem. It's the West.|`|QGF5huJgaa	Because politicians have failed to learn from history.|`|be8e24f50abc7e550004c9578ed470d7aa	Thinking Islamic anything is the "problem" is on par with saying blacks are incapable of learning and should never be left alone with white women. It's simply not true. Why use the same logic that justified slavery and segregation when we know it to be false.|`|el132RpPaa	i think imperialism is the problem|`|f5ab5f2677c2c5d709f95ec41b2f96fdaa	Well, that is a good point, but a little off the mark. The problem is the culture, yes that is true, but that does not mean that is because of Islam.<br>       You build a very wide conclusion based on a very unequal comparison with Japan. The defeat and almost total social and cultural upheaval that occured in Japan, and Germany, at the time, is very different than the social situation in Iraq. Both Japan and Germany went through their wars, their extreme nationalism and they were utterly defeated. The entire ruling elite, their ideas and their ideologies (even their history) were completely discredited and wiped away.      <br>       None of this has happened in Iraq, or in fact in any Islamic country. Moslems still hold on to a romanticized vision of their past and its glories. There has been no grand traumatic incident that has come in and washed away the "old", the socities continue on, stuggling to reconcile themselves with the modern world.<br>       Again, i refuse to link Islam itself with the situation in Iraq, because that would be wrong and unfair generalization.<br>  How would this explain the incredible rise of states like Dubai or Malaysia? I think we need to look more at the specifics within each country. Islam is just as bad as Christanity when it comes to violence. Just because mainstream Christianity grew up and matured does not mean that Islam won't. It's only a matter of time. No religion is better than the other, they all posses the same dogmatic and violence-prone beliefs.<br>       Let's also not forget the very violent and turbulent history and composition of Iraq. There was no Iraq before the 1920's and perhaps one of the major sources of violence there is that we are trying to hold something together that is not a country. Let Iraq seperate into the three areas that it really is and just leave it at that. Japan is a very homogenous nation state, and to a certain extent the German national idenity was well formed by the 20th century. None of this is present in Iraq.<br>       If you think that there is a hatred for the west, its race, religion and cultural identity, then there is also that in the west; a complete hatred and ignorance about the Middle East. <br>       I am not making excuses, and frankly, Islam can go to hell for all i care, it has many flaws, but i like to exmaine things deeper and discern where the problem lies, not just make grand generalizations that serve no purpose and only exacerbate the mutual ignorance on both sides.<br>       As for the answer about the fear by the militant groups in Iraq that the USA will succeed, yes that is very true, to them it is a clear cultural struggle, if the USA wins, then they lose. That is why, we must not lose in Iraq, this is a life and death struggle with medieval, fanatical forces that will not stop their hatred at Iraq's borders. The least we can do is to keep them really, really busy in Iraq.|`|0nZHAaQDaa	personally I think we are making a mistake in rebuilding anyone after a war. As if we leave them in the rubble they cant harm us can they? Of course I think we should seize their oil too , which could be used to pay for the costs of the war, and lower gas prices|`|AA10783710	Islam perpetuates a cycle of poverty, ignorance, and backwardsness.  It is like a heavy truck, hopelessly mired in three feet of slippery mud.  On its own, the truck will never extricate itself.<br>  <br>  However, with our intervention, these people will be exposed to new ideas.   They won't be able to hide behind cloaks of ignorance because they have seen another way.  What I really think needs to be done is a program of subtle, and sometimes not so subtle ridicule.  If these people realize their society lacks culture and civilization, they will try to change.  This is one of the main reasons the insurgents are trying to hard to make us leave.  They don't want their people exposed to new ideas.  In a clash of cultures, ours will always win.

It has a game-room, stateroom, showers, a communications center, and seating for 50. <br>  <br>  She was originally offered the same accomodations as Dennis Hassert had when he was Speaker, a C-21 executive jet, which costs about $900/hour to run. She objected to this because the C-21 doesn't have enough fuel to get her to California without stopping for a refuel. I can understand this objection, and I think it would be reasonable to give her a plane that can make the trip to California without a stopover.<br>  <br>  So then the Pentagon came back with an offer of a C-37 jet, which is smaller than the C-32, seating about 10, I believe, but has the capacity to reach California without refueling. It also costs about $5,500/hour to operate, making it much cheaper than the C-32.

T6V9zXymaa	Are you a minor? Your juvenile record should be expunged once you turn 18.<br>  <br>  If, however, you're not a minor, this information will remain on your criminal record for the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  It's not my place to judge what you've done or the decisions that got you there. Don't let anybody else (including people on this website) tell you otherwise. <br>  <br>  The fact is that if you're being 100% honest with your question, you're an unfortunate victim of circumstance. Your chance to argue about your friend's drugs or your mom's alcohol occurred at trial and it sounds like it didn't go so well for you.<br>  <br>  Something else to bear in mind: most employers will not discriminate against you for having misdemeanors on your record unless it directly applies to the position for which you're applying. If, for example, you worked in a restaurant that served alcohol, you might be turned down.<br>  <br>  Being accused of a felony offense, however, is a different matter. Even though you weren't convicted, a cursory criminal background check will most likely make things a little more complicated when finding gainful employment, but not impossible.<br>  <br>  Finally, to answer your question, you won't be able to make changes to your criminal record, even with a lawyer, unless there is sufficient evidence to reverse a judge's decision.|`|uh2bkRrFaa	A. Please, you insult us when you claim there were drugs found in your purse that you didn't know about. Everyone who drugs in the purse says "how'd that get in there?" Don't insult us if you want answers from educated people.<br>  <br>  B. The only way to get arrests off your forever record is with a lawyer. Even if you weren't convicted, it will still show up on your record when you're pulled over. I have a thing on my record that I had nothing to do with and was never convicted off 20 years ago but everytime I get pulled over the cop asks me about it. <br>  <br>  C. If there is a traffic ticket on your record past three years it's either a reckless driving (5 years) or DUI (7 years). Otherwise it's not three years yet. Moving violations are off your public record after three years.<br>  <br>  You lost job opportunities because you did dumb stuff, not because of bad luck or other people's actions. I wish more people would realize the consequences of carrying drugs in their purse or doing drugs in the long run, as I'm sure you can attest to.|`|6nsfG28Zaa	In theory the first thing you should do is get a certificate from concern agency that says this charges has been dropped or exceed the limit of it's appearance on public database. In theory they will still keep your record even if it finish the 3 year limit but they will need a court order to access this information. Once you get this certification you file a complain then if nothing happen after their target date you file another complain then if nothing happens you go to the agency that look after agency who oversee the operation of the concern agency if nothing happen you get a lawyer and file a charge on ombudsman. Ombudsman is a department specifically task to check the government  from time to time. It's a court for Goverment employee and it's branches.

And, work very hard to get into tip top shape.<br>  The more you sweat at the academy, the less you will bleed on the street.<br>  LIke the other poster said, study, study, study, this isn't college and frat parties, this is life or death.

C'mon, Bush knows where he is, but doesn't wanna give up that $$$$$.|`|AA10079277	Here's whats more interesting.  Many liberals (not all) were claiming we had captured him long ago and that Bush was just waiting until just before the election to announce that they captured him.  Well, we're still waiting...<br>  <br>  Also, why bother capturing hiim now.  We will not longer treat him like the war criminal that he is.  We will now put him in a comfortable jail in the US, and allow him access to our judicual system, with all of the rights of any American Citizen.  What's the point?  It will just cost us more money, and Al Qeada won't stop.  There is no longer a reason to capture him.|`|EAA6GIIWaa	This has been covered ad naseum on here, in the press etc.  If you haven't gotten by now, you lack the brain power to ever get it.|`|TpdVba4baa	In the White House.|`|oY5ehNXtaa	Ben Laden is my brother and I don't think anyone is after him!

Je suis anti-sarko come beaucoup de gens autour de moi, dont beaucoup de centristes ! je suis à gauche tout en étant critique vis-à-vis de PS, du PC et des autres LCR, les Verts etc...<br>  je leur reproche entre autres leurs luttes intestines qui ne font pas avancer le pays ! Je leur reproche leur vision archa?que du monde ! (Ségo a le mérite d'avoir proposé une politique diffrente, et pour cela elle a d? parfois contrer le parti).<br>  Mais être anti-Sarko ne veut pas dire être gauchiste (terme d'ailleurs plus utilisé à gauche depuis 20 ans au moins !!!) <br>  Il n'y a que les gens de doite qui utilise encore ce terme (et ils se vantent d'être modernes !!!).<br>  Je respecte les valeurs de la gauche même si je les critique, je ne peux pas adhérer à la droite qui pr?ne l'argent roi et le pouvoir, le capitalisme effréné qui laisse tant de gens sur le carreaux. <br>  Et donc Je ne peux pas adhérer à la politique de Sarko qui nous promet une société du mérite à l'américaine (quand on sait que les plus démunis aux Etats-Unis cumulent 2-3 emplois pour s'en sortir car le code du travail y est beaucoup plus libéral) et qui ne disposent même pas d'une assurance maladie ! <br>  Oui il faut travailler et non vivre de l'assistanat mais les ch?meurs, les RMIstes ne souhaitent que ?a !

Mais je ne me considère pas gauchiste, juste de gauche avec des valeurs humanistes, avec le rejet de l'argent avant l'humain, avec l'envie de vivre dans une société équilibrée où tous les pouvoirs ne tiennent pas dans la main d'un seul homme.

El fin justifica los medios...algo que las buenas personas no podemos considerar en ninguna circunstancia. Un buen político tiene que poder soportar no ser aparentemente una persona ética. Sus fines, que puede que coincidan con los míos, justifican (hasta cierto límite) los medios. No cualquiera puede dedicarse a la política.

Usualmente son los que regalan refrigeradores, estufas y aires acondicionados para de esta forma comprar el voto popular a última hora.

5db8a4d79ef1c9ff462987bc954ba65baa	I'm a pro-choice Republican who doesn't have a problem with letting gays get married.  I am a fiscal conservative and feel that we should keep government from being intrusive.  I am hard pressed to think of anything more intrusive than demanding that a woman give birth or telling people who they can or cannot marry.  <br>  <br>  I oppose using the government to promise to solve everyone's problems.  It can't be done and it only contributes to a feeling of entitlement on the part of many Americans.<br>  <br>  So, yes there are Republicans like you out there.  There are probably more than you think because the ones who get all the attention are far right conservatives.  It helps paint all of us as crazy.|`|pDuarKcjaa	I am a Republican and hold a lot of conservative viewpoints. I am pro-life. Although marriage, I really don't care, if someone is gay I don't care if they get married. If the gov't has any say in it I think it should be the states choice not the feds.|`|eafeb487799eda2a8dd4f1d8cb95f9c8aa	I'm a Republican.  I'm pro-choice and pro gay marriage.  (Not Equal marriage rights.  A gay man is equally able to marry a member of the opposite sex just like me today. Therefore our rights ARE equal.)|`|peEHzKGDaa	Yes<br>  <br>  Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe from Maine.|`|8diTOnNiaa	Yes there are many more people like you, that is why the Republican party is in real trouble.|`|98EXXItdaa	I'm a huge supporter of equal marriage rights.  A gay man should legally be able to marry anybody a normal man can.  A gay woman should legally be able to marry anybody a normal woman can.  But that is already the case, we already have perfectly equal marriage rights.  What is really being asked for is special treatment and extra rights, and I'm firmly against that.  I don't care what somebody does in their bedroom, just don't expect society to change to the whims of somebody's "lifestyle choice."<br>  <br>  I certainly wouldn't call myself pro-choice, but I'm not rabidly anti-abortion.  I don't think the government should ever pay for it, nor do I think insurance companies should ever be required to pay for it, or any complications from it.  I'm a bit disgusted that kids need a parental permission slip to go to a zoo, but they don't need one to get an abortion.  Beyond that, I still think it's wrong but not enough that I believe it should be totally illegal.|`|AbMQGoEbaa	yes there are some repubs like you.  just not any real conservatives.<br>  <br>  murder is murder, do not try to cover it up.  life is a basic human right.  in america, you can choose, but your rights end when you are infringing on someone else's right: the right to live.  there is never a  "dire situation" where killing a baby is necessary.  it is selfish and cruel.<br>  <br>  as for gay marriage, the church teaches that marriage is a sacred bond between a man and a woman.  personally, i have stronger feelings toward fighting abortion|`|ipWRgKetaa	Well, I'm pro-life and believe that abortion is the most barbaric and inhuman practice in the history of the human race, but I couldn't care less if gays got married. Personally, I think it is silly as heck but again couldn't care less if they want to act silly. All that's going on in the world and THIS is their big deal? What ever.|`|um87XJvmaa	That makes you a liberal  or moderate.Republican.  Someone the party seems to be wanting to kick out of the tribe.  There are a lot of Republicans with the same thoughts, but they are still in the closet.  It is only cool to be a conservative Republican right now.  It will change again. You don't have to be a "real" conservative to register with the republican party.<br>  <br>  I too, am fiscal conservative, a strong military, small government etc., but more liberal on the social issues.|`|xkcLOfTKaa	I don't look at either issue from the point of view of morality.<br>  They are states rights issues... CONSTITUTIONAL issues.<br>  <br>  1) Does a state have the right to regulate abortion as a medical procedure? (Currently, NO! The federal government has taken away that right)<br>  <br>  2) Does a state have the right to define marriage within the state? (Yes and No! The full faith and credit clause of the Constitution says that states have to recognize marriages from all other states, but of course, Clinton ERASED full faith and credit with DOMA in the 90's)<br>  <br>  Personally, I don't give a damn about gay marriage rights or abortion... but I care DEEPLY for rights of states and the Constitution of the United States!|`|879EON0taa	i'm currently Republican and i agree with you. i say "currently" Republican b/c i am looking for something else if the party does not stand up to it's origins of small gov't and less spending, and if the religious right increase their sway in the party i am outta here. i support everyone's right to choose their belief as long as we all respect the wisdom of our founders who sought to keep religion a personal issue, not try to legislate it into the lives of our citizens. independents are beginning to look better and better to me.|`|hiCSVwchaa	As a socially moderate fiscally conservative Republican you must feel like you've been totally abandoned by your party.|`|2MfFXmNMaa	I used to be a registered Republican, and I feel the same way.

As for segregation your actually over exaggerating I didn't find that at all. There is no room for hatred, prejudice or bigotry in the Navy especially when you and the rest of the crew has to work as a team therefore what you say wouldn't be tolerated by the officers or the crew for that matter.  I noticed that you say your Rhodesian therefore more than likely black and therefore your comments are very unsided and more than likely political.  I also have my doubts that you were ever allowed on board a warship in the Navy unless of course it was part of a tour.|`|JDAbWnJraa	It may not be so much racial tensions causing this segregationist atmosphere you found. Another possibility may be the growing number of street gang members who join the armed forces. This is an issue that the United States military has yet to fully acknowledge and confront. But I'm just spit balling here as I was not there to witness it.<br>  <br>  To continue the conversation, I would have no way to know if there were any gang culture aboard that particular vessel, so I can not speak intelligently on this. I was rather bringing up another view point, or angle if you will. There are growing concerns of street gang members joining the ranks of our military branches. Some may join to escape their gang ties, but then find fellow members once they are in and resume their affiliations. But more concerning is that some are joining, especially during war time, for the training and experience that they can in turn use once they are back on the streets.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, I have witnessed exactly what you brought up in your clarifications. Very surprising what will come out of a persons mouth when they are relaxed and sharing a beer. But this goes for ANY branch of the service and in to the civilian world as well. We still have a long ways to go as a people where race is concerned.|`|z1UXptEmaa	yeah its normal cause we dont take lightly to your kind around here... we kicked your *** in WW2 and we can do it again

The Obama administration supports those laws, said the HHS official.<br>  <br>  The Bush administration's rule adds a requirement that institutions that get federal money certify their compliance with laws protecting the rights of moral objectors. It was intended to block the flow of federal funds to hospitals and other institutions that ignore those rights.<br>  <br>  But the Obama administration was concerned that the Bush regulation could also be used to refuse birth control, family planning services and counseling for vaccines and transfusions."<br>  <br>  Did you even READ the article?|`|68149b1f13e1ba3a68e7e708172ff96baa	I am sorry you interpreted that article that way.<br>  <br>  To quote you, you would yell at an abortionist your first day.

This doesn't mean that they are feral and a danger to livestock! <br>  <br>  I think the RSPCA would have a lot to say about his actions; he obviously gets some kind of sick thrill out of killing creatures so he may be glorifying what he does (I have grave concerns for people who kill animals for fun - people who enjoy hurting animals often move on to wives and children). I have know idea why a railway company would pay someone to kill domestic and feral cats. <br>  <br>  If I were in your position I would contact the RSPCA (24hr Tel: 0300 1234 999). I would also contact your local police station and explain the situation to them - some have dedicated officers who cover wildlife crime and who would know all the legislation.

Of course!!! ... since we are dealing in total absolutes, a crime is a crime and killing is killing.. and killing is not only a crime but a sin, is it not?<br>  <br>  So.. how about it man, are you feeling like taking up the executioner task and then do the right thing and execute yourself?  <br>  <br>  If you are, then I will applaud your suggestion and proclaim you as the wise man who found the definite solution for crime, negligence and corruption.... not to mention overpopulation and the overwhelming spread of people who believe hate and murder is the answer to everything.|`|FD6DzHCfaa	that is my opinion also...  there should be a law making it punishable that way oh course the bleeding heart liberals and those idiots that put out water tanks and rations in the desert on the illegal boarder crossing routes shot suffer the same fate as them if we can ever get the law changed<br>  <br>  <br>  and to those that think this way of thinking is sick... then why dont you take them all into your house and pay for their needs so my tax dollars can go for things the citizens need... so you can start paying their housing, medical, food, etc.. out of your own pocket so they stop draining our system|`|ec978237b66f6b394c4e431732953b04aa	the supreme court as ruled that  non-citizen have the right to due process in the Constitution.

n2oEhdZiaa	When people talk about private armies, they think of Blackwater and former SF guys and whatever else.  There are many more contractors working for the military who do nothing of the sort.  They take over food service, some internal security, recreation, etc all sorts of things the Army would be doing otherwise.  Yes, these people are paid much more cash than our soldiers are up front, but we do not have to maintain them during peacetime, they don't get retirement, they don't get the insurance benefits, they don't get housing, etc etc etc.  It's a much cheaper long term to hire a temp than to groom a career soldier for a task like that.|`|oY5ehNXtaa	No.  The logistics won't work.

msqpyu9qaa	It depends on  the state. in some states there are different regulations and some states its banded in... so i suggest providing what state you are in when asking this question to get a complete answer but i will try to answer this not knowing the state<br>  <br>  First you need to read all the laws pertaining to bail bond enforcement agents  in the state you live or  you wish to work in. <br>  <br>  In most states:<br>  First you will need to submit an application for license and complete all required courses. In most states you most apply though the states insurence office.<br>  you would need to contact the Dept. of insurance the state you are in, request information and ask what schools are in your area for a bail bond class license.<br>  then you will attend to school and complete the given courses then apply for the license<br>  <br>  There are a few states that do not allow commercial bail some of them are: Illinois, Kentucky, Oregon, Wisconsin. <br>  Other states like Texas and Georgia have different bail statutes, sometimes per each county, while some only accept professional bail agents.<br>  A professional bail agent is someone who uses his own personal cash to post a bond. In Texas you may need to contact the local County bail bond commission board.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped.|`|4944a880689fe5e3510efeb36e3ec9b6aa	like the guy above said, Texas is different. <br>  <br>  in Texas, you have to be hired by a bond company who does the background check and recommends you before the county Bail Bond board (made up of judges, attorneys, and bail bondsmen). if you are approved by the board, you can write bonds for the company. to own the company, you have to have been a bondsman for 2-5 years depending on the county/board. most counties in texas require you keep at least $500,000 in property/money listed with the county to write bonds against, then you can only write up to double the $$ amount listed with the county.<br>  <br>  there was a time when you didn't have to have the 2-5 years before starting your own bond company.....things have changed to protect the bond companies' initial financial investment.|`|707b2ad27b78807dfe214484addb450eaa	YOU WILL NEED TO FILL OUT AN APPLICATION WITH THE LOCAL JUDGE IN YOUR AREA, GO THROUGH BACKGROUND CHECKS AND SO ON..

There might be a underlying reason that drove him to it. Is there any drug influence behind this ? You need to get him some help quickly. He most likely will serve awhile in prison. Rightfully so. what he did was pretty bad. Maybe with a good lawyer he can get out early on probation and community service.|`|F1qbRAMZaa	The first question- depends on what charge he is metted, you wrote here that it is armed robbery, so probably he is facing 2-4 years, I donot know if this is his frist time,second time or whatever. The court determine the habitual behaviour of each suspect(s) on custody.  If this is not his first then he is facing much stiffer penalty than 4 yrs. time. Armed robbery is a very serious offense, depending on which States you are in. Even if he doesnot hurt/injured anybody during the heist. Because robbery imply fear and aggressiveness, some victims suffered heart attack during robbery.<br>  <br>  What should you write? I think it is much better if you visit him every now and then, giving much support and confident that he will pass this trial in his life, since you wrote here also that you considered him as a younger brother, so what does a brother do this his brother but to comport him, and while you are at it, why not invite along a pastor or a preacher in your community to guide him while he is in jail, and tell the goodness of God in his life maybe then some changes will do him good while he is in his cell doing nothing, and contemplate about his life, if there is still some of it left, to make it better. If God can change a harden criminal why not your friend/brother in there. If I were in your shoe I would certainly do everything to change this person, if I have a good life why not him also?

PWvS7vqPaa	Yes, that would be highly illegal.  Unfortunately, your logic is faulty in that out of sight, out of mind does not apply here.  Whether a cop sees youor not, you are still guilty and it would only be a matter of time before you were found with it.  Telling him that it wasn't illegal as long as he didn't know you had it won't get you far.  The law in Ohio is as follows:<br>  <br>  CHAPTER 2923: CONSPIRACY, ATTEMPT, AND COMPLICITY; WEAPONS CONTROL; CORRUPT ACTIVITY<br>  <br>  2923.11 Weapons control definitions.<br>  <br>  (A) “Deadly weapon” means any instrument, device, or thing capable of inflicting death, and designed or specially adapted for use as a weapon, or possessed, carried, or used as a weapon.<br>  <br>  2923.12 Carrying concealed weapons.<br>  <br>  (A) No person shall knowingly carry or have, concealed on the person’s person or concealed ready at hand, any of the following:<br>  <br>  (1) A deadly weapon other than a handgun;<br>  <br>  (2) A handgun other than a dangerous ordnance;<br>  <br>  (3) A dangerous ordnance.<br>  <br>  (F)(1) Whoever violates this section is guilty of carrying concealed weapons. Except as otherwise provided in this division or division (F)(2) of this section, carrying concealed weapons in violation of division (A) of this section is a misdemeanor of the first degree. Except as otherwise provided in this division or division (F)(2) of this section, if the offender previously has been convicted of a violation of this section or of any offense of violence, if the weapon involved is a firearm that is either loaded or for which the offender has ammunition ready at hand, or if the weapon involved is dangerous ordnance, carrying concealed weapons in violation of division (A) of this section is a felony of the fourth degree. Except as otherwise provided in division (F)(2) of this section, if the offense is committed aboard an aircraft, or with purpose to carry a concealed weapon aboard an aircraft, regardless of the weapon involved, carrying concealed weapons in violation of division (A) of this section is a felony of the third degree.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Carrying weapons openly is ALWAYS illegal in Ohio.  That is covered in the first sentence of 2923.12(A) which states "No person shall knowingly carry or have" which means you cannot carry it openly.|`|4f3cjyw7aa	Get a concealed handgun permit.  It's even better than a knife.  You only need to be 21, so you've met that bar.  I believe Ohio requires a gun safety course before granting you a permit (also called a "CCW" for concealed carry weapon).<br>  <br>  In most states, a knife with a 7" blade will be considered a dangerous weapon, so you can't carry it without a permit.  But I've never heard of a state issuing a knife permit.  I love my CCW, gives you the peace of mind you need ;)|`|6Gfz125Paa	It's illegal unless you have a concealed weapon permit.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest you get a can of pepper spray.

VVCpJFxtaa	I don't see why we don't have a draft to be honest with you. We will never have a shortage of soldiers, sailors, marines, or airmen. We will get to get to choose who does and doesn't serve instead of taking anyone who can walk and breath and we will still have the best and brightest in our ranks.<br>  Also it may instill a sense of pride and responsibility to our nation in most young people. Something that is sadly lacking in many. There is no legit reason not to have every able body do a minimum of 2 year military service. Even the tree-hugging liberals can find a job in the military that doesn't necessarily mean a combat role.<br>  In case you haven't guessed I am proudly more conservative in my views.|`|PBq7ODPzaa	Don't want one, don't need one.  <br>  <br>  Oh, and mandatory military service is a nice way of saying the draft.<br>  <br>  All this talk about the draft these last few years was just a political ploy started by Charlie Rangle.|`|3caq6SFxaa	All the latest calls for restarting the draft have came from liberals and most of the calls to end the draft were done by liberals so I really don't know where they stand.  Most conservatives say why talk about it since it is not needed except to try to stir people up?  Personally I would like to see a system of universal service after high school for all; meaning no exceptions but that is not military service but could/would include many other volunteer work also.  Won't happen because people would soon look for ways to excuse themselves.  The anti-war/anti-draft movement of the 1960's had a very peculiar starting point; about the time the deferment for being in college was done; one deferment (excuse) for not being drafted was if you were in college-Nixon did away with that and the anti-draft movement suddenly grew huge.  As long as the poor and middle class was drafted and the better class of people in college it wasn't much of  concern but when they started getting drafted it beame a different story.  No I was not drafted but did volunteer and the military always had a pretty good number of volunteers-Vietnam was fought by 75% volunteers and 25% draftees looking at military personnel who served in the Vietnam combat zone and not just people serving in the military during the time frame.|`|N4u9DRvFaa	As a first round member of the all volunteer Army in July 1973 I can state beyond doubt that the quality of volunteers greatly exceeded the draftee's that remained my first year.

My first night at my permanent unit the 2 of us that arrived that day were told we would smoke hash with these guy's so they knew we were not CID plants to bust them. Several of these guy's met the profiles seen in many Hollywood depictions of junkies in the Army.

aGzLO9Oraa	I think the "policy" towards Iran is wrong.  I agree we can't make concessions to them, but we need to get them involved in group dialog with other countries as a beginning.  Isolating a country and severe sanctions only make the citizens of the country suffer but seldom do anything to change the actions of government.  <br>  <br>  If Iran really wants nuclear power for peaceful reasons, then we have no right to stop them.  Although they have a lot of oil, I read they only have one refinery.  Somehow, I think bullying them is only  making matters worse.  Jordan is also going nuclear.  They are our friend today, but what about 10 years from now.  <br>  <br>  We have an embassy and ambassador from Syria here, so I don't understand what all the hullabaloo was about Pelosi going to Syria.

The fact is if they currently have the item, your chances of getting it back through legal means are low.  <br>  <br>  Your best bet in my opinion would be to approach the individual and ask for it back directly, there is a good chance they don't know that you loaned it to them.  I'm not familiar with Ohio state law, but if you can produce some sort of documentation indicating you ownership you can go to the police and they will point you in the right direction.  <br>  <br>  Have you had any work done on the item, ever had it appraised, or does the person who gave it to you have any documentation?  This will help your case alot if you talk to the authorities.
b3PPtVS3aa	The end of homesteading<br>  The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 ended homesteading; the government believed that the best use of public lands was for them to remain in government control. The only exception to this new policy was in Alaska, for which the law allowed homesteading until 1986.<br>  <br>  The last claim under the Homestead Act was made by Kenneth Deardorff for 80 acres (32 hectares) of land on the Stony River in southwestern Alaska. He fulfilled all requirements of the Homestead Act in 1979, but he did not actually receive his deed until May 1988. Therefore, he is the last person to receive the title to land claimed under the provisions of the Homestead Act.|`|IufuXvLNaa	when there was no more law

bAHnXvgsaa	to give you a hint. A lot of medal of honor recipient are PJ's(even posthumously) It is one of the dangerous jobs in the USAF. Here is a paste from a website : Perhaps the most dangerous Air Force jobs are Para-rescue, Combat Control, Combat Weather, Independent Duty Medical Technician, and Tactical Air Control Party, who deploy with infantry and special operations units who rescue downed/isolated personnel, call in air strikes and set up landing zones in forward locations. Most of these are enlisted positions.|`|AlA4niu6aa	First, I'd like to start by pointing out a discrepancy in "nublett's" answer.  Not every branch of the military has a version of the PJs, which is short for Pararescue Jumpers.  The Air Force is the only branch that has a dedicated combat search and rescue special operations force, and the PJs are the only ones in the world who do what they do.  The Coast Guard, while they do have search and rescue swimmers and such, do not directly support special operations missions all over the world.  Pararescue does.<br>  <br>  In regards to fatalities, I honestly don't know the answer to that question.  However, that should not be the primary factor in determining whether or not you join.  Every branch of service, no matter what the job, suffers fatalities, especially considering we're in a war right now.  The Pararescue job is a dangerous one, considering you're jumping into hostile situations in order to get people out, mainly pilots whose aircraft have been shot down.  The Pararescue motto is "That Others May Live", and that's what your job will be: to train, jump into hell, aid the injured, and get them to safety.  It is a dangerous, but fulfilling, career field.<br>  <br>  I'm currently enlisted in the Air Force, although I'm in the Security Forces career field, not Pararescue.  I have an unwavering respect for those PJs, though, and I know I could never do what they do.  Their training is among the toughest in the special operations field.  It often takes more than a year to become a fully certified Pararescue operator, and the training continues even after that.  When you're not deployed, you're home training, and when you're not training, you're out the door.  Remember, PJs are special operators, and nothing in special operations is ever...ever...easy.<br>  <br>  Just do your research, and ask the questions, the first one being "Do I have what it takes to even be a PJ?"  The determining factor for you should not be how many fatalities there are.  The factors should be how badly you want to serve your nation, what you'd like to get out of that service, and what you'd like to do during that time.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.  I also suggest checking out the Special Tactics site below for more information on Pararescue.|`|M4TYfsGzaa	I'm sorry that I cannot answer your question about the number of fatalities.  I can however tell you that every branch of the military has some version of the pararescuees.  If you are going to base the decision of whether or not to join one of these teams on their annual fatalities, then it is not for you.  All of these special forces require almost absolute dedication to training, that is how their safety is insured.  The brave men and women who risk their lives in order to save others due so because they have a selfless devotion to their comrades.  Besides, there are always uncontrollable factors that may effect injury and fatality rates, like weather.  Perhaps you should consider a supporting role as an air traffic controller, mechanic, weather analyzer, etc.

For example, if we don't want Mexican Trucks to be travelling U.S. Roads (which opens the door to terrorist attacks, promotes drug and human smuggling and since very few of the trucks are inspected, could even bring bad stuff into the country), we could all write our congressmen and senators and if they don't do as we ask, we could vote them out of office.  If we had 100% of the eligible voters vote instead of maybe 30%, we would be exercising control over our government and they would have to tow the mark.  Additionally, if every person 18 years or older would set aside one hour every week to e-mail their senators and congressmen regarding things that get them upset, they would have to start listening.

Está la de `Los conejos′ que dirige Luis Vierma (vicepresidente de Exploración y Producción); la banda de `Los pitufos′ que controla el presidente de Pdvsa Occidente, José Luis Parada; y con el maletín está la nueva banda del `Gato Félix′, que es de DIEGO UZCATEGUI -la mano derecha de Rafael Ramírez-", aseguró García.<br>  <br>      El periodista indicó que Vierma le debe su puesto al ex gerente de Pdvsa América, "porque ninguno de los civiles que están en la junta directiva llegó allí sin la aprobación de Uzcátegui, que es el poder detrás del ministro, el mentor que le aconseja lo que debe y no debe hacer". Vierma, al tomar su cargo, maneja "el 70% del presupuesto de las inversiones, semejante poder no puede estar en manos de alguien que intente revelarse del dominio de Uzcátegui".<br>  <br>      Por un choque entre los dos directivos de la estatal petrolera es que se inicia la primera "cacería de brujas" en la Asamblea Nacional, pues, "Diego (Uzcátegui) ordena liquidar a Vierma ante la opinión pública y le entrega personalmente a Luis Tascón el caso de la empresa fantasma buscada en Colombia (Cosmaca) e Interbolivariana (...) así sale Tascón a atacarlo, pero fíjate que él no ataca a Ramírez, eso es porque a Uzcátegui no le conviene que caiga el ministro y la orden que dio fue solo destruir a Vierma".<br>  <br>      Maletín delator<br>  <br>      La supuesta rencilla entre los ejecutivos provocó el debilitamiento de "Los conejos", pero a la banda del "Gato Félix" no le quedaba mucho rato de felicidad: Con la aparición del maletín de los 800 mil dólares ilegales en Argentina, el hoy ex directivo de Pdvsa, Diego Uzcátegui, salió muy mal parado.<br>  <br>      "Es por eso que Tascón no quiere que se investigue el caso del maletín, y dice que quien lo haga es golpista. Claro, porque tú -dirigiéndose a Tascón- eres un empleado de Diego Uzcátegui que está metido hasta los tequeteques en el caso o no iba en el avión su hijo `Danielito′, quien fue el único que se quedó hasta el final con Antonini en el aeropuerto de Argentina (...) si la plata hubiese sido de Antonini... ?Cómo la dejó botada y se fue, si según la ley de Argentina se podía quedar con 50% del dinero y el otro 50% se quedaba decomisado?".<br>  <br>      La fuga de Guido Antonini Wilson le hace pensar al periodista que "esa maleta no era de él, ahí hubo un cambio de mano, porque esa valija era más escandalosa en manos de Danielito Uzcátegui o de cualquiera de los que iban en el avión".<br>  <br>      En cuanto, a la banda "Los pitufos", Leocenis García maneja la denuncia acerca de unos "pagos indebidos a la contratista Posada y Sandrea (P&S)". Y que además "José Luis Parada, quien fue compa?ero de estudio del ministro Ramírez, dilapidó alrededor de 4.8 billones de bolívares del proyecto Premio en 1 mil 500 contratos por adjudicación directa, dejando a la industria en occidente con un déficit de 138 mil barriles diarios, más de 170 fugas de gas en el lago de Maracaibo y la planta de Tía Juana en una situación casi inoperable", acotó.<br>  <br>      Los crímenes<br>  <br>      Más allá de la persecución y las amenazas en su contra, García continua trabajando sin miedo, pero "a mí lo que más me ha dolido es que ese irresponsable bandido de Luis Tascón, se burle de los muertos de Petróleos de Venezuela, quienes se jugaron el todo por el todo (...) para que venga Tascón a reírse de ellos y sus familias en la Asamblea Nacional, eso es una cosa para clamar justicia al cielo".<br>  <br>      La muerte de Alvaro Quevedo (gerente de plantas de gas en Maracaibo), quien "fue mi fuente en todo lo que intercepté sobre ese desastre que hizo José Luis Parada en Pdvsa Occidente (...), meses después de haber entregado el informe y habernos ayudado a presentar las pruebas, apareció flotando en el lago de Maracaibo con 2 moretones en la espalda, una muerte en extra?as circunstancias, de la cual dudan hasta los propios familiares", dice García.<br>  <br>      Luego está "Edgar Echarri, la mano derecha de Parada, quien es una persona que yo había denunciado por el desembolso de un pago indebido a P&S, y 3 días antes de que fuera a dar unas declaraciones a los cuerpos de seguridad del Estado para aportar datos contra su ex jefe, unos sicarios le pegan 8 tiros frente a su casa y delante de sus hijos".<br>  <br>      Otra de las víctimas es "Salvador Salazar (gerente de San Tomé), quien denunció la corrupción ahí y luego la banda 'Los conejos', -dirigida por Luis Vierma, ángel Nú?ez y B*rbara Lezama-, lo sacan de Pdvsa con un despido injustificado... A pesar de que éste se?or cae en una depresión por el pase de factura, lo siguen amedrentando y Salvador terminó quitándose la vida delante de los hijos", contó el periodista.<br>  <br>      Los casos más escandalosos<br>  <br>      Para el periodista Leocenis García los casos de corrupción más alarmantes en Pdvsa son:<br>  <br>            1- "El más de 600% de sobreprecio en los taladros chinos (700 millones de dólares)" el cual fue autorizado por "Luis Vierma, quien hizo el negocio directamente y sacó el intermediario privado para que recibiera la primera oferta de los chinos. Ahora tendrá que aclarar el ministro Ramírez si lo autorizo o no".<br>  <br>            2- "El tráfico de drogas en los tanqueros Pdvsa". Unos de ellos "fletado por Global y que iban en el 2005 cargados con cocaína... ?Cómo se explica que nadie hizo la inspección (...) si se puede hacer tráfico si se controla el PCP (Protección Control y Pérdida) -manejado por un amigo de WILMER RUPERTI?".<br>  <br>  <br>      "El narcopetrolero puede ser uno de los que se reunió en Aruba con Tascón", todavía no se puede afirmar nada porque "tenemos adelantada 60% de la investigación, y tengo que presentar unas pruebas ante el fiscal 50 de competencia nacional", según anunció.|`|15c11e1bcdd57dbd5f2f1ef51ecff3b8aa	Muy de acuerdo con caraemonita.
