xyQ8xDrYaa	Circuit City.  I used to work there they'll be under 15$|`|5FEVLTufaa	I saw them at TJ Maxx for $20 and I think the cheapest I have seen them is for $10 at Big Lots, but I live in Dallas so it might be a different price where you live...hope you find them, ^.~|`|VuaOKpYXaa	Here are some of them  http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-...  Honestly, most are between 15 and 20 dollars, Under $15 may be a bit hard to find|`|mrIzJRAgaa	ebay  walmart  |`|51M5edRKaa	FYE..... i got some there for $8.88|`|nkR5r9zKaa	why do you need skullcandy earphones?  Just get some apple earphones they sound great.|`|Oi0I9tnWaa	I hear walmart is the best. If not, try ebay|`|syaLdLEsaa	I'm not exactly sure if they are under 15 dollars, but at circuit city they have skull candy headphones for a pretty low price.  They have them for anywhere between 20 and 25 dollars    i hope this helps!|`|AA10198825	Newegg|`|mkgxBZq5aa	Most likely EBay of not that then try Craigslist |`|vG65NORVaa	it's kinda a random place to find stuff like that, but I saw tons of skullcandy products at a HEB Plus.  also, zune & apple make great headphones, but they are a little pricey!  anyway, if the HEB thing doesn't work out, walmart may be your best bet.
03nPoqXiaa	If there is no HDD you cant play ranked? My GF bought an Arcade, and with an extra head-set and ethernet adapter, she was playing COD4 in no time. And COD4 is ranked.    As long as there is storage (and you get a free upgrade from a 128Mb Mem Card to a HDD now, anyways) then you can go online. 256Mb Mem Cards work just as well as HDDs. The HDD just stores a lot more stuff, like Music and stuff, plus downloads. And even then, you only get to use about 14Gb of a 20Gb HDD, which is a rip-off.    Now, Pro Consoles come with 60Gb HDDs, which is good, but the arcade is a good deal if you want it on the cheap.    :)|`|7XYNveAraa	All version of xbox 360 work online if you have a internet connection. If you want to play online you will need xbox live gold membership... premium because you have a hard drive to save all your stuff.|`|I5B0QPL2aa	it works yes, but without a hard drive you wont be able to play `ranked`` game types          you cant play halo 3 ranked without a hard drive
ilScrvPEaa	Sorry, but yellow light means serious malfunction. Contact Sony. |`|7tYWqmZnaa	It's called the yellow light of death. You need to get that fixed.|`|AA10198825	Hold on to the reset button or call sony for a replacement.
2JC2rCX3aa	well i recently played the demo and it was Decent...but it has NO Online, so if your a competitive gamer and like to vs online people (im one of those people) than i would Not recommend getting this game...and if you love a challenge and a New experience to games than...Ya you'll like this game.But i warn you the Actual Gameplay is Really small 5-8 hours Total...so in less than a day you'll get Bored with it...so overall i would just Rent it...  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...     Some other games that you might like might be    -Resistance 2  -Little Big Planet  -Call Of Duty 4  -Call Of Duty 5  -Warhawk    just look these games up...most of these games are Really Amazing and i bet you'll like them Alot...|`|AA10198825	nah, there are many games better than that frustrating game.  |`|raEUval8aa	I enjoy the demo very much.     Maybe I'm biased since I do parkour and i think it's cool that they made a videogame out of it, but check the reviews,    it's getting between 8/10 to 10/10|`|ilScrvPEaa	I played the demo. Nice idea, but EA (as usual) hadn't finished the job. IMHO, bad controls. Get LittleBigPlanet, Fallout 3, MGS 4, GTA IV or Ratchet and Clank - TOD instead.|`|pl2SocVKaa	yes it is get it|`|uOMoJ83Caa	If you like something unique and challenging, yes.  I'm currently renting it from Gamefly and it is VERY entertaining, but the story mode was way too short. If you have online gaming then it is a lot better.  If you have the money to get a game and it appeals to you and you like parkour, I'd say go for it.|`|xLO5VRYTaa	YES!!!!!!!!!! Download the demo at the playstation store and see for yourself, its worth it!
7XYNveAraa	Mine is TheAssassinsx|`|83e74198ea7128062618d1bdf0a4f866aa	Just got my Xbox. It's austinj2001. I only have Crackdown.
6qPTQDdZaa	I've read that it's more likely to scratch your games if you set it vertical. I don't have any proof of this myself. Then you do have to worry about it falling like you said.     Personally, I'd only stand it vertical if I didn't have room to put it horizontal.|`|7tYWqmZnaa	It was designed to work either way and it does. More air can get into the system if it is horizontal.|`|TNp6jC7iaa	Well, this is an easy question.  Lay it down flat!  If not your going to scratch your games!    Hope I Helped!|`|UC27b06uaa	i leave mine vertical|`|7XYNveAraa	Put it down on its side because a survey has been done that Xbox 360's standing up would scratch cd's.|`|LFMg65oqaa	I had an experience at a party where we were playing 360 vertically and it wasn't my 360 but it was my game. Next thing you know from all the people the ground shook knocked over the 360 the 360 was fine but the game was destroyed. It had a big circle of burn in the centre of the disc. So it's probably better to play it on it's side no matter what stories you heard of it overheating it won't happen unless it's on for a LONG time. Also if you notice when you put a disc in the 360 when its standing up the disc slides down a bit. So that could scratch the disc.|`|ESkjX3rOaa	I would just put it on its side laying down. That will make it so you dont have any worries on what will happen to.  It wont fall over.   And also the air vents are on the sides so all the air vents are open and that will prevent the Red Ring of Death. Which would SUCK!!  But if its standing up that blocks one of the vents so you might get the RROD, since the air vent is covered, it will overheat!
381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	I'd rather pay a flat fee than pay a fee for the time I spend playing.    The problem with pay-as-you-play is that some people don't know how to keep track of how much they've been playing, and imagine the look on their face when they get a huge bill.    I think it's already pretty cheap as it is right now.  It's roughly 4 bucks a month.  |`|7tYWqmZnaa	bad idea|`|7XYNveAraa	Not a good idea
7XYNveAraa	I heard that Infinty Ward is making the game, (Infinty Ward made COD4) Also I heard that it was going to be Science Fiction (Not Confirmed Yet)|`|lADx09Uhaa	i heard it may be in space,or in vietnam|`|7tYWqmZnaa	Another Infinity Ward game, then a different developer who will copy them. After that another good, I mean Infinity Ward game, then a developer will copy them. That's the formula.
U7eDmvLoaa	According to VGChartz, GoW2 sold 2.1 million copies the first day.    That's just the first day, so by the time you read this, many more copies have been sold. My personal guess is 3.5+ million the first week (Nov 7-Nov 13) and 7.5+ million in the first two years.|`|7XYNveAraa	Aprox Over 2 Million|`|dHrmy2tiaa	alot|`|EkaB7xrSaa	Here' s a better question, "How many millions of girlfriends are bored out of their minds right now, ready to throw away that damn game?" My boyfriend's been on that s*** for hours now. I'm seriously like, "why don't you just suck Marcus' d*** already and take me out to a god damn movie!!"       Hey GayGase A: I'm sorry I might have offended you with the whole, suck his d*** comment, I'm sure it's because you wanted to first.|`|pIYEiFhuaa	9180842692856372650276501518361075601756...|`|YTxt5J6kaa	1|`|F8THF8Nbaa	elysse: this game is more important than you  also, 2 million copies have been sold
j5YdXZbFaa	search and destroy as long as your good at it for others headquaters was the second best in cod4 but i think that they switched that with CTF which i dont think u get lots of xp of off. So i guess if your not crazy at cod try hardcore search(easier kills)|`|EW7kRrWxaa	cant tell you  really as they change the point thing around a little  aleast in slayer    but in cod4 it was search an destory |`|7XYNveAraa	Search and Destroy
FJqpN88jaa	The experience is just an update. It may have it but if it doesn't, just connect the xbox to the internet and live, and it will update automatically. |`|AA10950302	No, Xbox 360s do not come preloaded with the current updates unfortunately. They usually have the one right before the current one. So you will have to update it when you get it.|`|7XYNveAraa	The update is a update download if you sign in on xbox live.|`|Ahn9dw2Raa	is a feature where your going to be able to install games directly to your harddrive and also have customizable avatars and it probably wont come out as standard on Nov.25 but all you need to do is update your xbox to get the xbox 360 experience|`|jCPwRy6Iaa	I would like to know that question.
VPukFPsnaa	check to see if your xbox charging string is still plugged into yur wireless controller (if you do have one) because the xbox will still make a noise if the charger is still plugged into the controller. |`|AA10114255	Turn it off at the plug. |`|5RkI7Gfbaa	Ya Spooky ****** ;)|`|7XYNveAraa	You might be still downloading stuff.
7XYNveAraa	Ok the new install thing that will be avalible on November 19, Installing games on your Xbox 360, will decrease the chances of getting a broken or overheated Xbox 360 because it works less. Also it can make your loading (loading checkpoints, gameplay etc.) much more faster. Another is that the Xbox 360 will sound more quiet. |`|rZGG2BD7aa	So that there are less loading times, game runs more smoother and there is less noise from the Xbox 360.|`|a7e39856faa19cab08a9b58b0f4cca89aa	Supposedly faster load times. And it makes the unit not have to work so hard, keeping it cooler...less RROD incidents.
7XYNveAraa	xI Recon Sniper Ix    |`|YeFi54U2aa	assasin|`|4SC79r2iaa	one time it suggested "racist light" after a name i chose was taken. No lie! i wouldn't suggest that, tho|`|09kwnLqraa	well, depends on what you play. I'll go with the norm, Halo and COD4. If you like to snipe, maybe use Sniper_____(your name). or SnIpEr_____ People also use variations:  Snipez  Sniperz  Snipes  (Capitalize random letters if you wish). Maybe use your favorite game:    HaLo BeAsT or something. Try to avoid using numbers such as Sniper Joe87596   It makes you look like a noob. In fact, try to avoid ALL numbers and Xs. Noob looking names are ones like:  XHalo ManiacX  Hal0 Beas7
Zdyd7rYtaa	1) No, you can still use the gamerpics but you can use your avatar as a gamerpic for no extra charge.    2) Netflix users can enjoy watching movies without paying extra for the service. If you have some of movies on your queue that the XBOX has in their library list, you can stream your movies to your XBOX within a minute.    3) Personally to me it's meh. There are some things I do like but to answer your second part not only is suppose to keep it quieter but it will prolong the laser disc from dying out and use less power.|`|7tYWqmZnaa	1. You can use either.  2. You will be able to stream content on Netflix to you console.  3. Nintendo didn't invent avatars. It is more a rip-off of Sony's XMB. The reason the disc needs to be in the console is to prevent you from copying it and then selling it. It speeds up load times and makes the system quieter.|`|MyHSGJTOaa	i do not own an xbox 360, however i am looking forward to getting one this christmas (possibly)    anyway, i saw it, and it is stupid! You have to sacrifice the blade dashboard for that??? I think it's lame and i think they force it on you which means no more blades.... :(|`|YYiI28nNaa	Look and listen. Because you haven't seen it yet on your xbox 360 you don'tt know how fun it is! (i got it on my from internet) You can upload games to your HDD and play from it (put you sill need to put the disc in) that reduces the DVD sound noise.    Xbox 360 later this year will be creating games that include your Avtars (like 1 vs 100) and much more! Don't worry about it! it will be better    You will still be able to use your Themes and Gamer Pictures! The NXE will be 1st and best Online System and features add-on.    hope this helps sorry that this is long but its the only way to explain it!|`|7XYNveAraa	1.) You can change between Avatars and Gamerpics.    2.) Netflix can make you rent movies through your xbox 360.    3.) Wouldn't you want something new?     The installing thing can also make you game have less loading times, better graphics and a lesser chance of getting RROD
Z2yaBeOraa	When it gets too warm then turn your xbox 360 off for about an hour to let in cool down.  Make sure your 360 is in a well venilatde area otherwise you risk getting RROD.  Hope this helps and have fun on your 360!:)|`|ODB0VvVMaa	Try giving it more space, more air it is probably either 2 confined or the fan is not working properly.|`|7tYWqmZnaa	You do realize that it generates heat and the back is where the fans are right?|`|zXrlsT0Aaa	GIVE IT PLENTY OF SPACE.    that way it can have some air and also you might want to buy a fan or something like that:    http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...      here's a link       hope i helped|`|yzmBNxbbaa	make sure it's well ventilated and whatever you do don't buy a separate fan they are bad for your system|`|7XYNveAraa	The Xbox 360 fans are just blowing the heat out of it. But make sure it is ventilated or even get a small fan and put it at the back of your Xbox 360
wtUnPEpPaa	Lol look in the instruction manual|`|GobM97OHaa	Hhahaha youre funny. Yes man, its the GROD and it will pwn us all. xD|`|7tYWqmZnaa	It is the power light. A quadrant will light up for every controller connected to the system.|`|7XYNveAraa	Its turning on|`|KgfgEQM0aa	that means it turned on lol|`|uKulGXhwaa	LMFAOO GREEN RED OF DEATH,,    no it means your system is working good|`|C4Sw8KBZaa	It means "it's on."
7XYNveAraa	You can still download after your xbox live gold expires.|`|igrgxjTgaa	You do NOT even need a live acount at all. You will be able to download the update to a flash drive or a cd when its out from the MS site and install from that. Actully the update got leaked a couple weeks ago, so if you really want it you can put it on NOW.|`|4Pk6VNftaa	You just need a Silver membership, which is free,  to access Live, download updates and access the Marketplace.  If your Gold membership expires, your account automatically goes back to Silver.  You can go always upgrade to Gold again at any time.    The only thing Gold provides that Silver doesn't is the ability to play online.  Under NXE, you will also need Gold in order to use the Netflix streaming feature.|`|7tYWqmZnaa	Yes, but you don't need Gold, Silver will do.|`|EW7kRrWxaa	well  with wilver account (really just a internet connection) u get all updates and downloads    first netflix is update on 19 not download     2  you need xbox gold  to use it then u need netflix member to really get it
BwyRLFrhaa	It goes live on the 19th of this month.  You have to have both an Xbox Live Gold membership as well as a Netflix membership to watch the streaming movies.  In order to use the service, you have to first login to your Netflix account online via your computer and fill your instant watch movie queue with movies that are available for instant play.  You then will be able to access those movies in your queue from your 360.  You won't be able to simply browse movies on your 360, they have to be added online.  It does offer HD quality picture though, unlike the usual streaming video you may be used to, which usually may look like a Godzilla movie with out of sync sound and grainy picture.  Overall this is a great service that will only improve as time goes by. |`|7XYNveAraa	November 19, 2008 is when it will come out and some other cool features will come as well.|`|V1O7N02saa	That is supposed to come via the New Xbox Experience update. That is scheduled to come out on November 19 (6 days as of this writing)|`|qnxAN2t5aa	supposedly it's coming at the end of november! i cannot wait. |`|wX4KAOTZaa	The NXE update, which includes Netflix among other things, is 19th November.  However there's only a small percentage of the Netflix library available for the 360 on the NXE luanch. |`|7tYWqmZnaa	November 19th, the same time as the update that will break a crap load of consoles.
u7il2SQsaa	Yes you can, It's reccomended that you do so because of the New Xbox Live Experience That is coming out soon. It requires 120 MB+ to download. You can also put music and stuff, but you probably already knew that.|`|7tYWqmZnaa	yes|`|GDscB8jAaa	yh it goes on the top|`|NMFBbh0Jaa	yes you can. all xbox360 hard drives are one-size-fits-all|`|aM5j9r4Caa	Yup. I got an arcade console then got a 20GB hard-drive for more space.    All Xbox 360 hard-drives work on all Xbox 360's.|`|7XYNveAraa	Yes.
a844eefb4729faed543f136f7a943ee0aa	You need to upgrade to an xbox live gold account by getting a subscription.  You can get them online or buy them from a retail store such as Target or walmart, etc. |`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	You need the gold membership to play online with other people.  |`|7XYNveAraa	You need to buy gold membership.
PqIyNTtOaa	Gears of War 2:    9.5 Presentation  The menus are very reminiscent of the original but the story is handed to the player in an entirely new way. Gears 2 stays at a very high quality throughout. New kill cams are very cool.   9.5 Graphics  Fantastic looking characters inhabit splendid worlds that feel truly alive. You?d be hard pressed to find a better looking game anywhere. Now if only they could fix the texture and framerate issues.   9.0 Sound  The sound effects bring you into the action perfectly and Jablonsky delivered on the score in a big way. Voice acting could use some work.   9.5 Gameplay  Some of the purest fun you?ll have. Instant gratification starts at level one and never lets up. It?s familiar for veterans of the first but throws in plenty to legitimize itself.   9.5 Lasting Appeal  Supposing they can fix the few multiplayer issues, there?s nothing stopping Gears 2 from ruling Xbox Live for some time to come. The photo mode is a great addition, too.   9.5  Incredible OVERALL  (out of 10 / not an average)     I have the game and it has a great storyline the weapons and graphics are amazing, it also will be very challenging.  Dead space would be my second choice because its just a very fun and adventrous game and is very realistic     I would get Gears of War 2|`|WgtZYJT7aa	Well I haven't played any of them. I would go with Gears 2, because a lot of people are saying that's it's gonna be game of the year just like Gears 1. |`|7XYNveAraa	Gears 2 and I'll add Call of duty world at war|`|p1Ii7uobaa	i would go for the call of duty. I have played it and love it. and everyone i know loves all of the call of duty games.
7XYNveAraa	It happened to me as well. Maybe they are just updating stuff for the New Xbox Experience Update.|`|fj5DxAf3aa	Have you had your xbox modified at all?

Voce PODE pintar com tinta prpria para forno de microondas, que alm de resistir s altas temperaturas (at 350o C) tambm possui propriedade condutiva. "Para que ser condutiva?" Na verdade o receptculo onde  colocado o alimento est envolto por uma estrutura metlica; a porta transparente, que tem uma tela metlica, e as paredes de a?o confinam as microondas dentro deste espa?o, caso contrrio essas ondas "encheriam" a cozinha. Assim a tinta condutiva tem o papel de manter as propriedades de conten??o, do a?o usado nas paredes internas.    Voce DEVE pintar ou retocar estas reas que est?o descascando, pois com o tempo o a?o daquela rea ir comecar a se oxidar e a ferrugem ir se alastrar, comprometendo as paredes internas, e eventualmente permitir que as microondas "vazem" para fora.    Esta tinta voce poder encontrar em lojas que consertam fornos de microondas, em embalagem "spray" e nas cores creme (p/ fornos antigos) e branca (p/ fornos mais recentes). Independente da cor, ambas tintas tem a mesma qualidade.

It's a simple process:    http://store.richspsxparts.com/psprehowt...|`|KY53VWHNaa	The analog stick is removable with a small amount of pressure ,you could do this and check for any dirt or  dust underneath ...but becareful if you mess it up you maynot be able to return under warranty|`|75b3f116dbfea90645b8a37988fb76e8aa	Well it seems there may be a problem with the underlying circuitry behind the analog stick. The best thing to do would be to return to the store where you bought it, and they will either repair it or replace it. I would not recommend taking apart the PSP, as that would void your warranty and chances are you wouldn't be able to fix it yourself.

GN85Qco9aa	My brother in law works at Apple, so I've ended up with an ipod photo, a nano, and OLD shuffle and the new shuffle...I use my ipod for a lot of things, including music.    First, I study foreign languages.  I put some of the sound files on the ipod so I can listen to them over and over to practice listening and pronunciation.    Second, I listen to National Public Radio, which has some VERY funny quiz shows making fun of Washing DC and politicians...I podcast those to my ipod so I can listen to those when I'm at school waiting between classes or on the train.    Also, if you like books, you can get books on tape and save them to your ipod.    I think it's very useful and if you get a shuffle, not terribly expensive.    As for other uses, I save data files on my ipod shuffle, first generation because it's connects to the USB.  It works just like a flashdrive.|`|92a7e8634557b7582c5144449ab44c8faa	you can download music, videos, games, and other audio. and i think you can do stuff with photos too. if you don't like collecting music then don't bother. i personally can't live without my ipod, but i only use it for my music, and i don't really see a personal need to upgrade any time soon.|`|BxgL62Nyaa	Neh dont get any MP3 player or MP4 is a waste of money go and get a phone like sony ericson walkman phone or the Nokia MP3 players are just waste of money.

0xu9u6qTaa	It all depends on personal taste my friend.    A goth will choose the Black.  A cute girlie teenager (or woman) will choose Pink.  A freind of mine has White one.

Happy picking.|`|04ae275e0eba2348a486022348c39c37aa	I would go for the black.  Game colors will contrast greatly against the black frame around screens. It's looks very sleek and modern.

AA10094907	this is all assuming you have already formated you memory stick using the PSP (it should be done already; it's just a warning)      Okay, you must get a usb cable.    Connect the cable to your computer and psp    on the home menu in your psp, go to the very left and go down a couple of times.  select 'usb connection'.  your psp should now be connected to your computer.  if you have windows xp (home or pro) there should be a new drive under my computer.  Double click on it    Let's just assume it was E drive (E:\).  be warned, it is different on different computers.    Once you're inside E:\, you'll see two folders, MP_ROOT and PSP.  You're interest in PSP.  double click.  now, you should see about five or six folders.  double-click on MUSIC.  put all your mp3's in here.  the psp will recognize them automatically.    videos are much more difficult.  bear with me for a few moments here.  the psp only plays 4-layer mpeg files.  these are NOT your standard video files.  the 4-layer mpeg files have a file extension of .mp4.  on top of that, they have to be named in a pattern the PSP will recognize and must accompany another file, all placed in the MP_ROOT folder.    Don't worry there are programs out there for free that make all this painless.  pspvideo9 is such an example.  google it :)|`|AA10380609	So you have a nice new PSP and you want to transfer music to it but have no idea how... we'll tell you...   The most important things to know if you want to copy music files to your PSP is that you need a USB Data Transfer cable to connect the PSP to your PC, and you MUST create a folder on the PSP if one doesn't already exist.  The folder must be named MUSIC and it must be within the PSP folder  If you do not do that, the PSP will not know the music is there.    1.  Connect your PSP to your computer via USB.  If you don't know what you need to do this,click the site below for more info.    2.  Turn on your PSP system.  Move to the SETTINGS option and scroll to the USB CONNECTION option and press X.  Your computer should acknowledge the PSP.  Your PSP will appear as a "Removable Drive" in windows.    3.  Navigate to the PSP using MyComputer.  It should, again, be a "Removable Drive" on your computer.  If the directory does not exist, create a directory called PSP.  If there isn't a music folder in there, create a MUSIC folder.    4.  You can then navigate around your PC and copy and paste or drag and drop files from your hard drive into this PSP/MUSIC folder.    5.  When you're done, press the O button to get out of the USB connection on the PSP them scroll to the MUSIC section on your PSP and the files should be there.|`|64654be523edaa92beb0f5e7fb4b0ddbaa	Attach  a USB to the top of your psp to the computer. Then click usb mode under settings on your psp. now you are connected to your computer. you may go to my computer and open up the psp drive. Now, drag any movie or music files within their apropiate folders, and they will show on your psp! simple as that.|`|G3qWOiNbaa	To get music file on the psp, connect it with a usb cable.  if u dont have one, just go online and type in psp usb into amazon and you will find one.  after connecting the psp to your computer, put the psp on usb mode.  to do this, go all the way to the left in the main menu and then go up until you see usb mode and turn it on.  on your computer, it should ask you what you want to do.  click open folder, go to "psp", and then "music".  open the music folder and just click and drag your files to the folder.      putting movies on is slightly more complicated.  you cant just put .avi files on the psp.  go to google and search for "psp video express".  download it from one of the sites and install it.  after installing, open the program and click open.  browse to the movie file on your computer and select the movie you want on your psp.  then just follow the instructions provided by the program.  good luck!

4PZmXc9Vaa	I'm not sure if this will work for Samsung or for your phone specifically but I have a Motorola e815 and with Bluetooth I have been able to create my own ringtones.  All you need is bluetooth and iTunes to do this.  In iTunes you pick the song you want to use and you choose roughly 25 seconds for the ringtone itself.  You go into the "Get Info" option and put in the 25 seconds you want.  Then you click OK and go to the Advanced options and convert it to an mp3.  It will convert the music to an mp3 and then you can simply drag that file to your desktop or you can find the file itself.  Now this is where it is specific to each phone because certain phones use mp3s and some use midi to play ringtones so that you will have to figure out on your own.  But if its mp3 and you have bluetooth, then send it to your phone and hopefully you will have a nice new ringtone; if its midi, you can easily convert it on a mac but changing the file extension from ".mp3" to "mid" and you have a midi file.  On a pc I'm not sure exactly but it shouldn't be hard at all.  That, although lengthy, is a simple and free way to create your own ringtones.  Now there are many more ways I'm sure but this is the one I've found most effecient and easiest.|`|KbEd9utTaa	As long as you have Bluetooth capability, you can do this via the wireless approach.

It's probably really simple and they've probably had to tighten a bunch of those krazr screens and will probably even do it for free esp if you have service with them.

nMDT37hfaa	Well, honey, er... you know that I am not a pro supporter but ... try 5 Rs Assistant, i.e. Reset, Retry, Restart, Reinstall and Restore. They can solve most iPod problems!  1: Make sure your iPod is charged    Make sure your iPod is fully charged and then toggle the Hold switch on and off.   2:To reset your iPod nano:     1. Toggle the Hold switch on and off. (Slide it to Hold, then turn it off again.)    2. Press and hold the Menu and Select buttons until the Apple logo appears, about 6 to 10 seconds. You may need to repeat this step.       Tip: If you are having difficulty resetting your iPod, set it on a flat surface. Make sure the finger pressing the Select button is not touching any part of the click wheel. Also make sure that you are pressing the Menu button toward the outside of the click wheel, and not near the center.     If the above steps did not work, try connecting iPod to a power adapter and plug the power adapter into an electrical outlet, or connect iPod to your computer. Make sure the computer is turned on and isn't set to go to sleep.   3:Retry your iPod with a different USB or FireWire port on your computer (please note that the latest iPods can only be synced through USB).   4:     Restart your computer, and make sure that you have the latest software updates installed.     Note: To update your Windows software, select Windows Update from the Tools menu of Internet Explorer.   5:To reinstall your iPod nano:       To update and reinstall your iPod software, first download the latest iTunes software.     Next, open the new version of iTunes and connect your iPod to your computer. iTunes will then automatically check to see if your iPod needs to be updated and perform the update for you.     To then check the software version on your iPod, select it from the source list in iTunes. iTunes will display the information about your iPod.  6:To restore your iPod nano:       Warning: Because Restore erases all of the songs and files on iPod, make sure to back up any files you've saved on the iPod disk. All of your songs, videos, podcasts, audiobooks, and games can be loaded back to your iPod provided that you have them stored in your iTunes Library. If you use the Nike + iPod Sport Kit, see this document for more information.  How to restore your iPod:     Make sure you've reinstalled the latest version of iTunes.   Open iTunes, and then connect your iPod to your computer.   After a few moments, it will appear in the Source list in iTunes.   Select your iPod in the Source list and you will see information about it appear in the Settings tab of the main iTunes windows.   Click the Restore button. You will be prompted with one or more restore options that may prompt iTunes to automatically download of the latest iPod Software. The 4 possible restore options are:   Restore Option 1: Restore - Restores with same iPod Software version already on iPod.   Restore Option 2: Use Same Version - Restores with same iPod Software version already on iPod even though a newer version is available.   Restore Option 3: Use Newest Version - Restores with the latest iPod Software on your computer.   Restore Option 4: Restore and Update - Restores with the latest iPod Software on your computer.      A progress bar will appear on the computer screen indicating that the first stage of the restore process has started. When this stage is completed, iTunes will instruct you to leave iPod connected to your computer to complete restore.   During the stage 2 of the restore process, the iPod will show an Apple logo as well as a progress bar at the bottom of the display. It is critical that the iPod remains connected to the computer or iPod Power adapter during this stage. Note: The progress bar may be difficult to see since the backlight on the iPod display may be off.   After stage 2 of the restore process is complete and the iPod is connected to the computer, the iTunes Setup Assistant window will appear asking you to name your iPod and choose your syncing preferences similar to when you connected your iPod for the first time.    Good luck!  Try http://www.apple.com/support/ipod/|`|bDyQ5rp3aa	you can email me at loganlonga@yahoo.com for question but these are some of the other photos games anything you set in extras like notes ect..|`|d2qEoetLaa	in settings make sure that album artwork is unchecked... that's an "other" that takes up lots of space.  get rid of any pics on your nano too...|`|f074d4478c6fdd41c61d2ebc1e2e6455aa	If you don't have any pictures or extra stuff on it, and it's still showing that you do, there's something wrong with it. But when you plug your iPod in, a screen should come up that tells you all about your iPod - such as whose iPod it is, and so on. There should be a button there that says 'Restore'. This will just whipe your iPod clean. If that doesn't work, you should probably take it back.     And, another thing, there's always the help button at the top of the screen too if you can't seem to figure it out. Good luck!

AA11539218	Megapixels are a way to make the average consumer think their camera is better.  All in all it isn't megapixels that make the images better it is the actual size of the imaging censor inside the camera.  Normal point and shoot cameras have such small censors in them that the megapixel count doesn't even come into play and you won't get much more than 8MP image anyway.  The only way to see a difference in quality  is to use a point and shoot (small sensor), then a entry level DSLR (medium censor) then the Professional SLR (full frame censor).  The professional SLR will have the best image even if it is a 6MP SLR compared to a 12MP point and shoot because the SLR has the larger imaging censor...thus able to gather more data from the light hitting the censor.<br>  <br>  Now that you know megapixels don't mean anything...any point and shoot camera with 5MP +  rating will take perfectly clear shots for every day use...i wouldn't base your choice on a camera because of the megapixel count.<br>  <br>  I still use a Canon Digital Rebel 6.3MP SLR from 2004 as a backup body and it still takes better crystal clear perfect focus images than the newest point and shoot 12MP and up, of course this is also because i have professional glass attached to the camera but still shows you megapixels don't mean better quality.|`|u47j7Seqaa	There's some really bad advice on this site reading one or two of these replies. Im sure people just guess at the answers.<br>  <br>  Anyway the guy who said sensor size is important gets my thumbs up. As does anyone who suggests the lens (glass) counts for a lot.<br>  <br>  Megapixels are important though. For sheer detail you need megapixels. Nikons new 24MP SLR proved this and when looking closely at the images is an improvement over its 12MP little brother (zooming in and enlarging images shows this).<br>  <br>  Yes there are other factors equally as important and whenever possible you'd want the best combination possible e.g. there's no point putting rubbish glass on the new Nikon D3x as much as its pointless having 14 megapixels on a tiny point and shoot sensor.|`|xLuwji94aa	Nope, Ken Rockwell wrote this great article on the megapixel myth: <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.h...</a><br>  <br>  "Joe Holmes' limited-edition 13 x 19" prints of his American Museum of Natural History series sell at Manhattan's Jen Bekman Gallery for $650 each. They're made on a 6MP D70." (Ken Rockwell, <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.kenrockwell.com</a> )|`|I5SypMlsaa	but also look for optical zoom, high meagapixel value is nice but you dont really need anything over 10-12 MP|`|fp9bOiVFaa	Not necessarily. Anything over 5mp and you're not going to notice a difference - the lenses become the limiting factor at this point. Megapixels are generally used as a marketing gimmick as it's a single number people can look at, but it doesn't really tell you anything about the camera. A 6mp Canon SX100 is going to take better photos than a 10mp Casio camera. Megapixels are something to consider in a camera, but you shouldn't make your decision based on them.|`|tHjBr4L4aa	I hate seeing the negative rating for the sound answers above, but they're right.  Higher megapixels, by itself, is not better.  Is more horsepower better in a car?  Depends upon your priorities.  Would it come at the expense of gas mileage, cargo space, passenger comfort, handling, or dependability?  By itself, it's just another factor.<br>  <br>  Here's my basics for megapixels, as supported by Ken Rockwell, David Pogue and countless others.<br>  <br>  1. More megapixels means larger files.  If you budget in more and larger memory cards, that's not so bad.  Do you always shop at Costco, or are the packages beyond what you need sometimes?<br>  <br>  2. More megapixels on a compact digital camera won't give you better results than fewer megapixels on a DSLR.  A DSLR has a larger sensor, thus producing higher quality images at any setting than a compact all-in-one.<br>  <br>  3. How many megapixels do you need?  I'm planning on upgrading from my 10mp Nikon to a 12mp Nikon in the near future.  BUT, it's the ISO range and low-light abilities of the new camera that attract me.  If it had 10mp or even less, I'd be fine with it.<br>  <br>  Bottomline - I'd rather have a medium resolution camera with better low-light performance, outstanding handling,  and a better lens, than just another megapixel monster.

cOQCC93maa	I have the same problem if your games or something won't load. It goes under the category "Media Loading Problems". It usually doesn't evolve the dust, but is your blu-ray player that is broken. If this isn't your problem, just call them anyway, cause the steps are just the same. Give sony a call, tell them your problem, and If you want them to repair your system for you (You might even get a new one) for free, make sure you are still under warranty. They'll send you an empty box, you put your system in, send it back to them (really easy to do and is all free), and you just wait to get your refurbished or even new system in about an average of about 1-2 SOMETIMES 3 weeks. If your not under warranty, still give them a call and maybe you can work something out. Their number is 1-800-345(SONY) which is 7669. Make sure to press the right buttons as a machine guides you trough on what to press when you call so you can talk to a live operator.<br>  <br>  p.s. Just for a heads up, it costs 150-190 dollars (in Canada anyway) for them to repair your system and to give it back to you if your not under warranty. If your not under warranty, call them anyway, it won't hurt, trust me!<br>  <br>  Hoped I helped.|`|88MRgFPtaa	is there a disc in the system? try taking it out.

jzSx5kAxaa	I would imagine anything Apple would be a good start.  Try to learn all the ins-and-outs to using a Mac and the common problems there in...For example, go thru Yahoo Answers and there will be tons of common Mac problems....read through ALL of them to find the best solutions....Once you get the full understanding of these "common problems" then go apply at an Apple store...they will give you a technical interview (which is the most important) and viola you get the job|`|0rpN2419aa	It would be fun job if you are tech savvy about the products they sell.  Go into the store and ask questions about what you need to know, and they will probably tell you where to get the training.  The place where I got mine had clerks selling the Apple products and they also had people who could help you with the tech questions.  Maybe you could start out as a clerk and go to school for tech support on the side.  It never hurts to ask.  <br>  <br>  Have fun!!!
R20LOzsiaa	According to the sales page of Amazon Kindle, you can convert them to Kindle format for free and without the wireless connection, then copy the document to your Kindle through USB cable. Since this does not need the wireless connection, it will work outside USA.<br>  <br>  See the last paragraph below, it is extracted from the Kindle sales page:<br>  <br>  Personal Documents<br>  <br>  Kindle makes it easy to take your personal documents with you, eliminating the need to print. Each Kindle has a unique and customizable e-mail address. You can set your unique email address on your Manage Your Kindle page. This allows you and your approved contacts to e-mail Word, PDF documents, and pictures wirelessly to your Kindle for a small per document fee--currently only 10￠ per document. Kindle supports wireless delivery of unprotected Microsoft Word, PDF, HTML, TXT, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP, PRC and MOBI files.<br>  <br>  You can email your PDFs wirelessly to your Kindle. Due to PDF's fixed layout format, some complex PDF files may not format correctly on your Kindle.<br>  <br>  If you are not in a wireless area or would like to avoid the fee, you can send attachments to "name"@free.kindle.com to be converted and e-mailed to your computer at the e-mail address associated with your Amazon.com account login. You can then transfer the document to your Kindle using your USB connection. For example, if your Kindle email address is Jay@Kindle.com, send your attachments to Jay@free.kindle.com.

fwdsp3dVaa	It'll work just fine. Your TV will 'upscale' the 1080i resolution to it's native 1080p resolution. It'll still look great!<br>  <br>  For the Sky HD, since it's max resolution is 1080i, i would use a Component cable! Component cable's max resolution is 1080i, while HDMI is 1080p. So HDMI won't make any difference in picture quality over the Component...and Component is cheaper!|`|9z7k8HCXaa	Yes it can 1080p is a higher definition than 1080i, it just means that you have more than is needed for viewing the sky box!|`|dC7d5sy5aa	Here is a list of the connection technologies and the resolutions that they support.:<br>  <br>  HDMI (1080p, 1080i, 720p, 480p, 480i)<br>  Component (1080i, 720p, 480p, 480i)<br>  S-Video (480i)<br>  Composite (480i)<br>  Coaxial (480i)<br>  <br>  As you can see only HDMI support both 1080i and 1080p.<br>  <br>  If you can use the HDMI connection as it is digital and will provide a degree of future proofing. Having said that if you do not have HDMI on your Sky box the next best option is the component for video (3 RCA cables) and either optical (toslink) or digital co-ax for audio. This will give you the ability to transmit 5.1 digital sound.<br>  <br>  If you opt for HDMI you need to consider the length of the cable run. If it is less than 15 feet a "standard" HDMI cable will suffice. If it is more consider using a "high speed" cable. Ensure that you buy from a reputable source and ensure that the cable is marked with the HDMI logo and has 1.3 version written on it (don't worry about a, b or c as these are just testing protocols). Lastly if you are in a coastal or high humidity location consider getting a cable with gold connectors. This will not improve your signal but it resists corrosion which over time degrade your signal.<br>  <br>  Remember you can never improve a digital signal by using expensive cables but you can degrade a signal by using inferior cables.|`|U6aqWM01aa	yes your sky hd will show pictures in 1080i ..to benefit from 1080p you will need to attach a blu ray player to your HD tv.<br>  <br>  HDMI is the BEST option
geixYUgzaa	is your tv 720p or 1080p or 1080i?  You may want to check the playstation's settings.  Make sure you've selected the correct resolution and check to see if you have selected hdmi as the output.|`|Bv2qN1gQaa	Make sure that the settings are set to the HDMI cord, and that the resolution is 1080p, the best quality. Maybe also make sure the hdmi cord is nice and tight. And if the promblem persists, try a gold plated HDMI cord, if u don't already have one.
