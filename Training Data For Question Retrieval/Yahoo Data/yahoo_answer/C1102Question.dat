Well my sister has her big prom this year and our school is pretty traditional and she's like a complete rebel so she's going to the anti-prom party.

For her makeup ; glow in the dark yellow lipstick, glow in the dark turquoise eyeshadow, glow in the dark white contacts, glow in the dark neon green eyelashes with aviator sunglasses made of glow sticks. Her hair in high bunches with a cap made of glow sticks over it.      Is that too much or does that sound okay? I think it sounds awesome personally.

My hair is naturally super curly, and I straighten it most of the time, just because my curly hair is hard to deal with.

I am stretching my ears from a standard 20/18g to a 14g in my progression up to a 2g.  I put in 14g tapers and had no resistance and only a slight sting in one ear for less than five seconds.  I have a set of 12g tapers and when I tried to put one in it went all the way through my ear with just slight resistance and still no pain.  Should I just start at a 12g?  I have had my ears pierced at the standard size for 20 yrs(since I was a week old) so I think maybe my holes are larger than I thought from so many years of wearing earrings. I just keep thinking of all the blowout horror stories and don't want to push it too far too quickly.
20090219125023AAjTM5S	Beauty & Style;Hair	Permanent Hair Dye over Temporary?	Hey everybody.   I currently have red/auburnish hair. It was dyed with a permanent dye to get that color roughly 4 months ago.    Recently I bought a temporary Black dye, and put it in. It didn't completely cover the red, and it is almost washed out.   Now, I want to use a permanent Black dye, today.       But my question is, and it may be a silly one, is that;   Will the permanent black dye take to my hair, despite the temporary still partially in it?    My guess is that it will, I just want to make sure ;)      Thanks for any answers!

I've really wanted to get my tongue pierced for the longest time, but have been wicked skeptical about it too. I just think it's the cutest piercing! I have a patriotic tattoo on my shoulder & my cartridge pierced..so the whole pain factor doesn't phase me.      I was just wondering what the overall perspective of getting a piercing would be? My Dad hates it. My Dad doesn't think girls should be tatted up or pierced up. He said he'd never stop Loving me, but he'd just be upset. My best friend thinks I should do it, and she wants to record it, haha. My boyfriend thinks it's sexy & told me to do what I want.       How does a normal person feel? Like if you just walked up and met me, saw my piercing, what would you think? It's not like I'm one of those people who feed off of everybody's thoughs, but to some extent I care about what people think. I don't want people who don't know me to think I'm trashy.

Every time I go in to get my hair done (which is rare because I'm broke) I have the hairdresser inform me that I have residue in my hair from my conditioner. And they try to sell me some salon type that are way too expensive. So of course, I always decline.      Recently I was at the mall and the salon inside was having a huge sale on shampoo. I bought the BioLage (?) shampoo and conditioner and paid a total of $40 for both bottles.       I do notice a huge difference in my hair. Because I had it highlighted a while back, I can't use the regular stuff because I can barely get a brush through it.       What is a good yet affordable shampoo/conditioner? I know there are some to avoid, but I'm also not sure of those either.       Anyone a pro in the salon business that can better advise?? :)      Thanks!

However it fades really fast... and every time i take a shower, i feel like carrie after the prom.       Using cold water definitely helps, as does using a lot of conditioner. I tried a tinted shampoo/conditioner (the one for brunette/red hair) but my hair faded to a weird orange this way (instead of a peach pink). But cold showers get really old, really fast XD      What do you all suggest? I know that putting a little bit of the dye in your shampoo/conditioner is supposed to help, but that stuff reallllly stains your hands.          Thanks in advance!

20090220102537AASNlXE	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Best way to heal my infected 3/4" stretched ear?	I recently stretched my ears from 5/8" to 3/4" and have never had a problem stretching. Although, my right ear is a bit of an *sshole and is a bit tighter than my left one. So I would say maybe 4 days have gone by since I got my right ear done (I used a 3/4" taper due to the big stretch, then slept with it in for the night so I could easily put it in in the morning) and today I woke up and it was infected. I got in the shower and it was a bit tough to pull the plug out, but I managed. I cleaned my entire ear with Dial Antibacterial soap and when I got out of the shower I dabbed some Neosporin on the inside. Then I put back in my 5/8" plug due to how nasty it looks and because I don't want it to shrink down too much. So, I was wondering if this is the best way to clean it, and how long it might take before it heals. It's pretty gross because my right ear is currently a bit lower than my left because the lobe is pretty fat...         ALSO, if you have nothing nice to say, then don't say it at all. I'm asking for advice and not opinions. I like my stretched ears.

I have been going to this place for over a year and never had any problems. However, shortly after I left the salon, I began to notice some odd smell coming from my head. I did not think much of it since the services that I got were: hair wash, blow dry, flat iron and the cut-nothing out of the ordinary. Also, it is a salon where they only use Aveda products. However, ever since Friday, I have been washing my hair more than once a day and have even tried different shampoos and it is not making the smell go away. I notice the smell is worse when I am washing it, I can not determine if it's a burnt smell or a chemical smell. It sure smells unclean though. Please let me know what you think, I am so frustrated with the smell!

Okay, some of my friends and I are going out to eat at an semi casual/fancy/expensive restraunt (if you want to look it up it is Azie Global Cusine in Media Pa) and then have a slumber party! We are going to dress really nice and do hair and makeup and make it look really well done! I just have no idea what to wear and i was wondering how to dress up an old dress or if u had any inexpensive dresses that you know of for sale. I have brown choppy shoulder to chin legth hair, im 5'4 and have annoyingly long *yet muscular!* legs, and I am thin. Also, please keep them modest! Thanks!
