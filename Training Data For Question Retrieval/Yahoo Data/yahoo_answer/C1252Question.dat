They don't fight for dominance like lions and tigers do.   .......Lions and Tigers are the superiors , they don't fear each other and they don't respect each other.

A certain brand of fruit-and-cereal bar contains 160 food calories per bar.      1.) If a 65.0 kg hiker eats one of these bars, how high a mountain must he climb to "work off" the calories, assuming that all the food energy goes only into increasing gravitational potential energy?   h=_____m   2.) If, as is typical, only 25.0 \% of the food calories go into mechanical energy, what would be the answer to part (a)? (Note: In this and all other problems, we are assuming that 100 % of the food calories that are eaten are absorbed and used by the body. This is actually not true. A person's "metabolic efficiency" is the percentage of calories eaten that are actually used; the rest are eliminated by the body. Metabolic efficiency varies considerably from person to person.)   h=____m

What is the electric field at the midpoint between the two charges? (kC = 8.99 x 10^9 Nm^2/C^2).      I've been trying to figure out this problem but can't get the correct answer.  The answer is suppose to be 1.3 x 10^9 N/C.  I'm using the equation E = kC (q1q2/r^2).  Can anyone please help me get the correct answer?  Thank you!
20090222214034AAitHze	Science & Mathematics;Physics	NEED HELP with last physics problem. With kinetics I believe.?	1.A particle experiences a constant acceleration that is north at 100 m/s2. At t = 0, its velocity vector is 70 m/s east. At what time will the magnitude of the velocity be 100 m/s?       This is what i got so far, but i believe i might be right.   So far I know:   ax (constant acceleration) = 100 m/s^2   Velocity initial = 70 m/s (initial because time starts at 0 correct?)   Velocity final = 100 m/s (same theory applies to how i found velocity initial)   time = ? (what I need to find)      I find a suitable kinetics equation: vfx - vix = ax*deltaT   apply my simple algebra skills and get an answer of .3 seconds. But apparently that's not the correct answer. What am I doing wrong here? Am I suppose to consider vectors too?
