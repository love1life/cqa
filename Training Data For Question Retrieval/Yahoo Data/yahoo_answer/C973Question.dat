20090205130626AADNLmD	Sports;Basketball	Lakers fans, what do you think about a Odom for Brand trade?	Their salary match, and Brand isn't playing well in Philly, especially now coming off injury. Odom can fit into the Philly's running offense and he can give Andre Miller some support in handling the ball. Brand is a risk worth taking in my opinion, he is still capable of putting up at least 15pts, 8reb, and 2blk a game, and he is a great post threat. The biggest gain is probably on defense since Lamar is really a SF struck in a PF body, and Brand can fill that pure PF role until Andrew returns.  The Lakers can start Brand off the bench when Bynum returns (depend on how effective Andrew can be coming of injury), he can be the offense for the bench.

Michael Jordan:   69 Points - 18 Rebounds - 6 Assist - 4 Steals - 1 Block - 2 TO      This game was on the road against a rival playoff team (The Cavs) and Michael Jordan set 2 career highs (Points & Rebounds). The rules were also different. At this time they allowed hand checking, there were no 3 second rule, and teams usually applied "The Jordan Rules" while facing Jordan (The Jordan Rules includes double/triple teams & rough play).  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Rule...

I am wondering what the **** are they talking about we are 2 wins away from last season's win total. Not to mention we are one of the most highest scoring teams in the NBA.      The record does not reflect .500 or above, but we have been flirting w/ .500+ all year this year. Not to mention even w/ KB24 and LBJ23's offensive barrages we fought back and kept in both games. A case could be made that Knicks were robbed against the Cavs when they cut the lead to 1.      Anyways, look at the quality wins this year we have beaten the Celtics, Rockets, Suns, Hawks, Mavs, Pistons w/ Billups, Heat, Jazz. All .500 teams and I see a team that is much improved and could be playof bound

He does What's Right for the BUSINESS.   If that means Jobbing & putting Younger Talent Over - So be It.         But , I can See How People can like him.

I have been melina's fan since her debut in the wwe because she led MnM to be 3 time tag champs in there rookier year by cheating and taking chances. i also love her entrance with the split and paparizzi and music it's all perfect but... there is one thing lacking. do u agree or disagree that melina is better as a heel or face? i think heel. her    charater was way more better and she snobby the paparizzi princess. she was more entertaining to watch as the bad guy because she helped MnM win 90% of their matches not to mention she was great on the mic and she mangaged to hold on to her women's championship for a long time. I think the wwe has completely destroyed my favorite diva. her charater as a face is stale boring and it's only a matter of time that she's going to be like michelle mcool. the crowd is completly dead when she comes out but they have no choice but to cheer a little just because of her entrance. i'm pissed that vince once again has managed to screw over another superstar and this time it's melina my favorite diva of all time. i'm beyond pissed, she may be the 2nd most sucessful member of MNM but i feel like she still does not live up to her full potential. it makes me upset because i knew that if she debuted in the wwe as a face it would have worked then but it's 2009 and i see her career stuck in one spot. what do u think?

20090205143446AATh32x	Sports;Basketball	How stupid were the Sixers to give Elton Brand such an expensive and long contract?	There were reports about injury's coming up, even though his shoulder isn't what was expected. The truth is though, even with Brand, they weren't a better team this season than how they ended up last season. They had to work for their cap to be available for an All-Star or superstar type player and they waste it on an over-the-hill injury-prone foward. He played in 8 games last season, and they give him 5 year/82 million deal. This has pretty much eliminated them from the whole LeBron, Wade, Bosh, Amare thing that'll be going on in 1 1/2 years, although they may have figured no legit superstar would want to play for an average middle-market team. Well, as a Knicks fan who's seen this happen all to many times, I love this. It only improves both the Knicks and Nets chances are the playoffs now. Plus, I love seeing bad breaks for Philly sports team lol

But when it comes to coaching, sometimes he just looks like an idiot.  He has some weird defense that always leaves 3 point shooters open and brings big men like Dion Thompson and Hansbrough to half court to try and trap a guard.  He never calls time-outs when he should, and if he ever does call a time out, he never says anything to the players.  Carolina has so much talent but it always just looks like they're playing pick up basketball with no organization.      Roy needs to do more than look stern on the sidelines.

I'm a full-grown man myself and after seeing that, unless I know for a fact that they've made that so-called safety equipment stronger and more durable, there's no way I would ever do that same thing without bringing a parachute.

20071006055222AA6Ux7X	Sports;Football (American)	Coaching at Clemson?	Anyone agree that Tommy Bowden is a piss-poor coach? Special teams have sucked for 2 years. Why can't they fix it? He stuck with a lousy quarterback (Will Proctor) all  last year to the detrement of the season. The offensive play calling is horrendous. If the momentum swings against Clemson, they sink, he can't coach them out of it. Last week at Georgia Tech, they never recovered from a blocked kick. When they were only down by one score they played as if they were being beaten 50 to nothing. No fire, no momentum, no enthusiasm.  I hear a lot of Clemson fans voicing frustration at the abundance of incredible talent being wasted by terrible coaching. This program will not be successful until a change is made. As long as he beats his dad at FSU, the administration seems appeased. Meanwhile, Clemson rival South Carolina has arguably the finest coach in college football history. I never thought I'd say it, but, Go Cocks!

I couldn't think of anything so my teacher suggested I do something about if LeBron will pass MJ. I need soldid facts as to why this could happen. For example LeBron has went farther in the playoffs in 3 years than Jordan did his first 3 years. I need stats like that to back up my speech.

20070606071529AA2A05h	Sports;Martial Arts	Escoger un arte marcial?	tengo 17 a?os y mido sobre 1.85 m (creo que los he superado) y peso sobre 89 kilos.       Me interesaba la practica de capoeira para aprender a dominar mi cuerpo, pero me he dado cuenta de que la mayoria de capoeiristas (creo que se dice asi) son mas peque?os y delgados y yo soi de complexion fuerte asi que soi anchoo de espalda ?prodria yo ser un buen capoeirista, o me limitaria mi complexion?       De no ser esta una buena eleccion me gustaria que me recomendaran un arte marcial mas acorde a mis caracteristicas fisicas. Ya estuve unos meses realizando deportes de contacto como full contact y busco algo mas profundo que pegarme de ostias todos los dias.      posdata: a pesar de ser alto soy bastante flexible sin haber tenido entrenamiento asi que eso no seria problema.

I want to eventually be able to run under a 6 minute mile and 4 miles in around 28. What I'm asking you guys for is a running workout that could get me there. I usually run about 2 miles at an 8:30 pace, and I know that's probably not good enough, so I was wondering what the best workout would be...and how many days a week I should run. Thanks for your help.

Considering the Jaguars were on the rise to be a powerhouse football team until the 2008 season, in which the team was decimated by injuries to the offensive line and had a lack of a deep threat big-play receiver, do you think with a successful draft the Jaguars will be able to reload and be a threat in the AFC and into the playoffs next season?
