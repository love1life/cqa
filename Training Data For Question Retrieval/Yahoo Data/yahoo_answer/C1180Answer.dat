I'd just call them and ask.|`|uBvvNONNaa	It depends on whether you have it done with a gun or a needle. If it's a needle then around ￡20 is normal, if it's a guin then could be as little as a fiver!<br>  <br>  The needle is better though, less trauma than the gun.|`|Cb6019xbaa	usuakky there about 20 or sometimes less it depends were u are going but you should call and ask or at least stop by nd ask if its possible.
AA11615514	If you look at fashion magazines aimed at teens you'd think girls are supposed to look very thin. If you hear women and girls talk they feel pressured to fit into that unrealistic ideal. Most men like women to have curves in "the right places." If a girl is too skinny she isn't going to have breasts or hips or a butt. All heterosexual men like women to have breasts, hips and a butt. I heard a man on a talk show put it this way, "only a dog likes a bone."|`|HNjNWHSyaa	the media makes people want to be like all thoes popular girls who are tiny and really pretty.

qOKFuXfLaa	Most reviewers reported breakouts. All of these reviewers have oily skin. So, this product is not recomended to those with oily skin.|`|cFA6VFQ6aa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you. There are so many products out there so what I end up doing is starting cheap and trying out a few different ones.I would check out the review site at <a href="http://www.brandsmakeup.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.brandsmakeup.com</a> visit and read the reviews.|`|22bef8b28219c364cd5a97ca5b5320edaa	I love MAC!! its almost all i wear. i wear Select SPF foundation (others are too matty for me) i use select cover-up for blemishes, and select moisture cover (bc eyes always need moisture under them) for under my eyes. remeber if your a cool undertones, (redish in the face) use the letters with NC, if you are Warm use the letters NW(dark spots). the NC helps nutralize reddness and for me that helps alot for my light skin. also, i love a makeup setting spray called model in a bottle, it is excellent! makes my makeup last all day!!<br>  <br>  they say that the scuplt is too thick for everyday but go with your gut! the employees there are so wonderful! theyll help u!|`|C1dRwOWAaa	I bought it last week and fell in love!

zlXofrG4aa	Sure if you want, go ahead.<br>  I personally love extensions and sell them in my etsy store.|`|Yeh8KQkBaa	No, because hair extension can damage hair. Dying hair can be just as bad. Stick to the natural look. It looks much better without the damage.|`|OSD5by7Oaa	yes.

MSM66SEnaa	If it were ME, I'd go all out. It's a wedding and in the Bahamas for goodness sakes, the pictures are going to be in the memory book forever! You have to look your best.<br>  I'd get warm highlights, depending on my haircolor, they could be anywhere from browns to reds. If you have blonde hair, (which I'm guessing you do) I'd get a light brown. Nothing deep, or dark. Like a caramel. <br>  And then I would definitely get a tan. Spray tans are better for your skin, but sometimes you come out a bit orange. <br>  Also, make sure your dress goes well with your hair color, eye color.. etc. <br>  Of course, if you're IN the wedding, you really don't have a choice. The bride picks for you.. <br>  Depending on the length of the dress, I wouldn't get a pedicure. If it was a short dress, however, I would. And definitely a manicure. Your fingernails will be seen regardless.<br>  I think that's about it..|`|OSD5by7Oaa	Go tanning or get sprayed tan , but not this early have your hair done Buy sun dresses and do your makeup really pretty!!<br>  .....|`|SgADncXZaa	You said it..

Your best bet is to go to a store like Sephora and try out a variety of products in your shade range. In the meantime, here's a rundown of our 10 favorite tried and true foundations. <br>  <br>  1. Best Foundation Stick: Bobbi Brown <br>  Foundation sticks are great for covering blotchy skin and were made for women on the run who need a quick fix. They provide on-the-spot coverage in a flash and there's no better product than Bobbi Brown. Make sure you blend in product after applying. <br>  <br>   <br>  2. Best Pricey Foundation: Chanel <br>  Flawless. Chanel products go on smooth and aren't drying (but they also don't add oil to your already oily skin). A plus is most come with an SPF of at least 15 -- a big bonus in moisturizers. We suggest trying out the different versions at the Chanel counter. <br>   <br>  <br>  3. Best Inexpensive Foundation: Revlon ColorStay Foundation <br>  If you're going to spend money on beauty products, we usually suggest saving it up for a good foundation. But this inexpensive product is worth a try. If you have oily skin, you might want to skip this product, however. Best for women with dry skin. <br>  <br>   <br>  4. Best Pricey Foundation Powder: Laura Mercier <br>  Powder foundation tends to be more matte than sheer or satin, so it's great for women with oily skin. This product blends well & has great staying power throughout the day mainly because it comes in powder form, which is great for bringing along in your purse. <br>  <br>   <br>  5. Best Affordable Foundation Powder: MAC Studio Fix <br>  We've used this powder foundation for years. The trick is to find the right shade. MAC Studio Fix is perfect for women with oily skin who want to minimize the appearance of large pores. Keep in mind you might need different shades for the different seasons of the year -- you're usually a bit darker in summer. <br>  <br>  <br>  6. Best Foundation With SPF: Philosophy 'The Supernatural' <br>  This foundation is one of the best rated and most popular on Drugstore.com. We gave it a whirl and loved how light it went on without being greasy in our t-zone spots. No wonder this foundation is much-beloved. Plus, we love that it is SPF 15. <br>  <br>   <br>  7. Best Tinted Moisturizer: Clarins Hydra-Care Tinted Moisturizer <br>  Clarins consistently impresses. You'll find these light, tinted moisturizers offer great coverage without feeling heavy. And there's no better tanning product out there than Clarins. Here, you'll get the moisturizer and the tan without the need for a heavy foundation. <br>  <br>   <br>  8. Best Cream Foundation: Cover Girl Aquasmooth <br>  Cream foundations offer the best of both worlds to women with dry, flaky skin: Total coverage and rich moisturizers. <br>  <br>   <br>  9. Best Liquid Foundation for Dark Skin: Iman Second To None Oil-Free Makeup, SPF 8 <br>  Iman is not only a famous model, she's also the creator of some of the best makeup for dark-skinned women. Her foundation comes in a variety of shades, contains 8 SPF, and it goes on with a semi-matte finish. <br>  <br>  10. Best Cream-to-Powder Foundations: Vincent Longo Water Canvas <br>  This base delivers a great matte, even finish. You'll find it lighter than the creams so it's perfect for women with normal to oily skin. But a warning: This foundation can show off your dry skin and blemishes. You'll want to apply it with a sponge

JQKADWyzaa	First of all make sure you use the goggles to protect your eyes, also put sunscreen if you can on your lips and your nipples if you're worried about them, I don't know I did that when I tanned becasue it made me feel safer, that skin is so sensitive and prone to damage.<br>  <br>  How long you go should be determined by what kind of skin you have, usually if you ask your tanning bed person they'll tell you a good start out rate. For pale skin the recomendation is starting out from 3-5<br>   <br>  Q: How often should I tan? <br>  A: In order to build a tan, it is important to tan regularly. Don't let too much time go by between visits, or your tan will begin to fade. You can tan up to once every 24 hours, but it is generally recommended that you wait at least 48 hours in between each session to allow your tan to fully develop in between visits. You can build up your tan by going to an indoor tanning facility three to four times a week. Once you have a tan, you can maintain it by tanning two or three times a week. <br>  <br>  Q: How long does it take to get a tan? <br>  A: Usually, you will begin to notice results after a few tanning sessions, but it may take a few weeks of regular tanning (at least three times a week) to get to the color you are looking for. If you are developing a base tan before going on a trip, you would want to start tanning about three or four weeks before you go. <br>  <br>  <br>  Also be carefull!!! that tan looks really good, I know. and before big events and trips it almost seems like a nessecity. Just keep in mind that there are dangers.|`|83s95VX8aa	sun is cheaper|`|jsCjGUPuaa	i dont want to be mean but dont do it. wait until summer (the season your suppose to be tan) and do it the natural way when you can use protective stuff and not look fake|`|yf0tevyfaa	Yikes, I wouldn't recommend tanning beds at all. They're worse than regular sun tanning and speed up the aging process of skin and increases the exposure of UV rays, giving a more likely chance of skin cancer.<br>  <br>  If you really want to go, DO NOT go everyday, that is way too much.<br>  I would say go twice a week at MOST and when you get the desired look stop for a while.<br>  <br>  If you tan naked then your nipples may get darker. You should always wear sunscreen whether it is natural tanning or salon tanning. They could burn if you don't.|`|AaXl3vcCaa	yes you can get cancer but lots of other things do too and that was not the question!<br>  <br>  so i would recommend going 3 times a week at first then once you have a base tan then just maintain it, start at half the full time if you are really white and just see how it feels, if you dont get red or anything then go a couple minutes longer the next time, i have never had my nipples burn but when i went too long once i burned my butt and could not sit in jeans! ha, but the people at the salon will be able to recommend a time to start with since the machines are different<br>  <br>  no one can tell you how many minutes to do if they dont know what machine it is, some beds only go for 10 minutes some 30 so it depends on the machine|`|doHNEvf8aa	careful, your but and boobs can get burned really easily, i always put like spf10 or 15 on them. <br>  go everday for about a week, start with 8 minutes, then work your way up to 15 (it isnt really necessary to go any higher then that).  then go about once or twice a week from then on to maintain your tan.<br>  <br>  also always check with friends and stuff to see if you are getting too tan, you dont want to look fake.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|eTBfsjCUaa	I tan every other day and no your nipples will not burn....just start off tanning 10 minutes and work your way up to 20. Be sure to use some kind of lotion to so you will get darker faster and so you won't get too dried out.|`|oVOaaEJnaa	If you insist on using a tanning bed then 3mins a day max. No longer. It's really damaging long term. You'll look lovely a healthy brown for 10years and then you'll start getting wrinkles really early and stuff. Just get a spray tan, these days you can't tell the difference. Prob cheaper and definately safer!|`|5XYlHv6Paa	Never go more than every other day. It's not real good for, but I love it. I would go every other day until you have a nice color, then go once a week.<br>  <br>  But remember, too much of a good thing is never good.|`|i0uDt7H9aa	i would'nt tan if i were you.. it's so unhealthy for your skin.<br>  but, if you must, you should only do it once or twice a week.|`|IeLBIACaaa	ive heard that it becomes addicting due to the tremendous relaxation the heat lmaps cause.  Just dont become one of those orange people who thinks they look good|`|YaFKI2lxaa	Yes your nipples gonna burn.|`|IIKwBSrxaa	Never again.  Your skin won't be so tan and pretty once you get skin cancer.|`|dzqxQmpFaa	You shouldn't. Can cause cancer same as the real sun|`|F9Uz05FXaa	I tan every once in a while, i usually go everyday for about a week..depending on your skin type you would go for different amounts of time. If you are very pale and burn easily i would start out at only about 5 minutes, but if you have more olive skin its okay to go for about 8-10 minutes starting out. as you go you can increase your time. Generally if you are in a tanning bed and there are lights on both the top and bottom of the bed, you shouldnt have to lay on your stomach.|`|6LnjYAZ9aa	this is great feedback... except for a specific few.<br>  <br>  The "ahhhh cancer waaahhhh" people.<br>  <br>  <br>  Those who plan on tanning know very well what we are getting into, we've heard that speech many F'ING times, and trust me, yours ain't any different.<br>  If you are against tanning beds, why the heck are you checking out tanning questions in the first place?! <br>  We don't bombard YOUR blog questions telling you to use a condom, not to smoke, or tell you to lose weight cause your fat a$$ is gonna get diabetes. So next time, if you don't have anything helpful to say,<br>  KEEP IT TO YOURSELVES.|`|ZVx1w9vUaa	do not go tanning!! its really bad for you.  my mom is a nurse for a dermatologist and she tells me that so many patients come in with bad effects from tanning. when u get older it will come back with awful effects

4w361g8Laa	There are no pills, shampoos, oils or creams that will speed up hair growth. Hair grows on average 1/2 and inch per month. Some people's hair grows quicker, some slower...it's all predetermined in your DNA. And you can't alter your DNA with shampoos or conditioners.  I've heard prenatal vitamins work but I've only heard that from women who are already pregnant, so I don't know if they would work on someone is not pregnant. <br>  The main thing to keep in mind when growing out your hair is to keep it healthy. Get regular trims (every 4-6 weeks), eat lots of veggies, proteins etc. Make sure you are not over processing your hair with colors perms or any other chemicals. Don't overdry your hair with heat styling---blow dryers, flat ironing, hot rollers etc. Good luck|`|5hKpO7l8aa	I have used two different vitamins - Solgar:  Skin, Hair, and Nails and Ultra Hair Plus.  Both of them contain MSM which is suppose to be a good vitamin for hair growth.  I have used each for 30 days each.  I have seen the average hair growth of 1/2 inch each month.  My hair was not growing at that rate so it has been an improvement for me.  I am continuing to use the Solgar:  Skin, Hair, and Nails vitamins plus a take a multivitamin and fish oil tablets.  The healthier you are the healthier your hair will be.
AA11345910	Gold plated is a base metal like brass or steel that has been plated or given an "overlay" of gold.  Karat Gold is solid gold.  By the way "Carat" refers to the weight of a gemstone.  "Karat" refers to the percentage of gold or other precious metal in the jewelry.  It is a common error to think these words are interchangable, but they are not.|`|c05702374b5bc85f3a1502d55060a46eaa	Gold-plated is cheaper metal have gold on surface. Karats tell how pure is gold, 24 kt. is 100% gold, 18 kt. is 75% pure, 14 kt. is 58.3% pure. Plating has karat too. Today, Miyuki wear 18 kt. white gold Audemars Piguet "Lady Millenary" watch, have 142 diamonds, cost $36,400. Gold-plated jewelry much cheaper of 18 kt. solid gold.
3pUDXn0Zaa	You sound like a usual kid. Materialistic. A bit spoilt. Other than saying your a straight A student, you list money, brand names of products! All that tells us is that that's all you think or care about really. The list was the first thing that came out of your head, so they are your priority.  You added that your nice and humble. Did you add this because your initial list got the responses they got? How are you nice? Humble? I'd say your a very young maybe 11-14. A follower at the moment not a leader, but that hopefully will change when you get older. You follow the fashion trends instead of going your own way. <br>  <br>  What about the homeless, poverty, charity, doing good deeds for no reward? Caring about issues, people?

OHfZFR31aa	It's strange that you were scouted by Elite in London as they do not have offices in London - it's one of the only major cities that Elite does not have an office in.  Their affiliate agency in London is Models 1, which is not part of Elite but they have a sort of partnership. Normally you would have been scouted by Models 1. And if you were signed by Models 1, then they would send your portfolio to Elite offices around the world for consideration for representation.<br>  <br>  A test shoot does not mean you are going to be signed. It's the next step in the consideration process. They want to see how comfortable you are in front of the camera, how you pose, how you move your body, and if you are photogenic. They should have hair/makeup teams on set as well as a stylist to pick out the outfits. Wear something simple - jeans, t-shirt, heels. Wear a nude g-string and nude bra as these will work under any outfit. Make sure your hair is clean without a lot of styling products. Keep makeup to a bare minimum. <br>  <br>  If you are under 18, you should bring a parent or guardian with you as you are not legally allowed to sign any model release forms or contracts if you are not 18.<br>  <br>  They may shoot you in 2-3 outfits and a variety of poses - headshots, full body shots, motion shots, etc. Then after the shoot, the agency board will review the photos and decide whether or not to sign you.<br>  <br>  Feel free to email me if you want more info|`|yp8NtB0faa	ok....... i want to see a pic of u if one of the top modeling agencies in world just came up randomly and said they want to take pics of u!!!|`|81SHaBnZaa	Well I would say to just stay confident and if they want you to change the way you look, like getting piercings or tatoos or SURGERY, don't do it.

The spray works well, and it's convenient.|`|NMXTzJKsaa	Just use a saline solution to clean it 3 times a day.  Rotate the stud when you do it.

UiSLahaqaa	The necessary vitamins that aid in promoting thick hair are: vitamin A (produces healthy sebum in the scalp), vitamin C (antioxidant), vitamin E (improves scalp circulation), Biotin (produces Keratin), Inositol (keeps hair follicles healthy), Niacin (promotes scalp circulation) and pantothenic acid, Para-Aminobenzoic Acid, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 that prevent graying and hair loss. There are several products in the market today in the form of shampoos, oils, conditioners, sprays and other applicants that can be put on externally for improving the health of the hair. These products contain necessary vitamins, protein and mineral supplements that are believed to enter the skin on the scalp and provide proper nourishment to the hair. Apart from these, hair vitamin supplements are also available in tablet/capsule form for internal ingestion. There are numerous companies that are developing hair vitamin products from herbal and traditional ingredients like ginseng, jojoba, green tea, He Shou Wu etc, which are believed to contain the essential vitamins for promoting healthy hair. The most common food-based sources of these vitamins are: citrus fruits, green vegetables, fruits like pineapple, strawberries, kiwi, potatoes, green peppers, vegetable oils, soybean, raw seeds, dried beans, wheat germ oil, brewer’s yeast, whole grains, eggs, liver, rice, milk, fish, turkey, chicken and red meat. Today, almost all hair care products advertise the presence of a necessary vitamin in their products that would make the hair thicker. <br>  <br>  EGG is the best for thick hair<br>  take hot oil massage and hot towel to gain shine back<br>  use good conditioner n a good shampoo|`|1vcDauz0aa	Herbal Essences is really good and so is Pantene.

JQKADWyzaa	My mom has a lot lot of freakles, and she says blush really helps. I guess it like blends them in without a ton of makeup. Also remember that its true that less is more, you want enough to cover it but not too much that you look fake. Alos acne is really hard to get rid of but I had it mildly and went to my doctor for a prescription cream and this thing called differin worked really well for me, It took a while to work but it did its job<br>  I found this article on how to cover freckles its really long but i hope it helps<br>  <br>  Stay out of the sun and when you are in the sun where sun screen with an SPF of 15 or higher. Exposure to sun will cause your freckles to "pop" up or more to appear. Freckles also appear more vibrant when you are hot or physically active. <br>  Regardless of your age or skin color you should always wear a SPF 15 or greater sunscreen. <br>  Most quality foundations have SPFs so always get one that does. <br>  Wearing sunscreen will prevent you from premature aging. <br>  These should be worn year round and not just in the summer or while you are tanning. <br>  Visit a make up counter and speak with a consultant <br>  Look for medium to heavy coverage liquid or cream foundation that matches your current skin color and blends well into your cheeks and neck. <br>  Do not buy a color the same color as your freckles or buy a color in between your freckles and your skin color. It's about coverage, not color. <br>  Medium and heavy coverage is most often used by women to hide flaws and even skin tone <br>  This type of coverage usually contains more oil so you won't find it in "sheer" formulas or hypoallergenic formulas (Clinique). <br>  Try several shades to find one that blends well with your neck and not one that is the same color as your freckles. <br>  The foundation alone may not cover them entirely. Don't look for magically disappearing freckles. Instead, look for a foundation that reduces the appearance of your freckles. <br>  Remember most people aren't looking at your freckles from less than a foot away <br>  You notice your freckles more than anyone and you are probably looking for them when most people aren't <br>  Now that you've reduced their overall appearance you can try to find a dual finish powder. This a powder that can be worn alone or as a finish to foundation. This is not a matte pancake make up, just a colored compact with a lasting finish. Since you are looking for coverage you will wear the powder on top of your foundation. If you didn't want to go all out you could also just use the powder with a more sheer foundation. These powders will usually be colored similarly to the foundations. These are pressed powders and not translucent loose powders. Translucent and loose powders will not give you the coverage you want. Besides, you will need something to set the heavier foundation. <br>  Apply the powder with a puff to your face over the foundation. <br>  Apply blush to your cheeks to add brightness and dimension and to accent your cheekbones. This is even more important since you are using a heavier foundation and you might not see the definition without it. <br>  Continue applying your eyeshadow, liner, mascara and lips as you normally would. <br>  If you are trying to hide freckles on your eyelids you can also apply the foundation and powder there. Do so sparingly but it will provide an excellent base for eye makeup and your eye makeup should stay on longer. <br>  Do not apply heavy foundation to your neck. Blend into your neckline like you normally would. Applying foundation to your entire neck will get on clothes and start to separate as your neck may perspire more. <br>  Remember to wash your face well and exfolliate regularly. The heavier foundations will clog pores so cleanse with proper cleansers for your skin type. <br>  Do not try to apply concealer to large areas of skin. The coverage is too thick and it will start to show lines and look cracked. <br>  You may be able to cut back on your normal moisturizer since the foundation will have more oils. <br>  If you've followed the steps your freckles are much less noticeable. Congratulations on your new fresh face. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] TipsCoverage and color are key. By shopping for make up at a make up counter you can sample product and get assistance with the different formulas. You can also ask questions. <br>  Let the associate at the counter know why you are shopping for these finishes. If you are younger they will almost always direct you towards the sheer finishes and formulas typically used by younger women. <br>  Don't let anyone try to sell you a color that matches your freckles and not your face. <br>  If you buy from drug stores you will probably waste more money trying to find the combination of product you need. If you must use these, make sure you can return it if it doesn't work and save your receipts. <br>  If you do buy from drug stores don't buy Cover Girl or Almay as those won't have the coverage you need. Look for the brands targeting the older woman and look for cream for heavier foundation formulas. Also loo|`|mBXu5G5saa	well go to a dermatologist!|`|8skZoXPRaa	Maybe change the type of foundation. Try different companies. I know that the ones that have oil in it are bad for skin, so try water based foundations. And make sure you clean it off very good before going to bed. Then put some non oily moisturizer on, so your skin doesnt peel. Thats what helped me.<br>  Have you tried the products that can bleach the freckles a bit?<br>  There are professional products, but lemon juice face mask can do it too. <br>  Do your freckles get more obvious and darker when you are tanned? If not, maybe you really need a tan so they blend with the rest of the skin.<br>  Hope it helps.|`|eTBfsjCUaa	You should really go to a Dermatologist. <br>  But if for some reason you can't then you should use Neutrogena products. I love them. Wash your face at morning and night and then apply a moisturizer to the dry areas.<br>  Also, I have freckles and I spray tan. It makes me look soooo much better!<br>  Good luck. =)|`|ISPIa0n5aa	have you thought about trying proactiv solution?  also, avon has a system that is proven to be as effective as proactiv solution.  also, you need to use moisturizer before you put on foundation, but use one that won't clog your pores.|`|gNX1T2sbaa	i wish i had freckles|`|cwsYM2F4aa	You need to buy a good facial cleanser and moisturizer.  Use them every morning when you wake up and every night before you go to bed.<br>  <br>  It also sounds like you are using some kind of foundation that is not good for your skin type.  <br>  <br>  I swear by Mary Kay products.  You should be able to find a consultant in the phone book or just chase down one of those pink cadillacs.  They will give you a free facial.  They will test your skin and find out your skin type and which products are best for you.  They can also help you find the right foundation for your skin type and perhaps find a good concealer to help you hide your freckles, if you wish to continue doing that.  If you use concealer, you won't have to use so much foundation.  It will look more natural.<br>  <br>  Once I started using Mary Kay products, my face literally cleared up in about three days and I haven't had but the very occasional blemish since.  It's great stuff.  I highly recommend it. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|JWNzoksmaa	You really can't do much about the freckles..unless if you want to spend a lot of money on creams..but personally i think those creams are bad for your skin.  <br>  <br>  NEway, as for the pimps and dry skin.  You need to hydrate your body more. You skin is the largest organ on your body.  Yes, seriously, it's an organ.  And for nice healthy skin you must drink the proper amount of water daily to keep in looking nice and healthy.  <br>  <br>  I was just watching Food Detectives on Food Network and they proved that drinking the average 8-10 glasses a day of water does improve your skin and give you a nice healthy looking glow.  <br>  <br>  So drink a lot more water and stay away from soda.|`|D78jfOMZaa	Your skin needs to breath. The make up plugs your pores and it's hard for them to breath. When you get pimples don't put any make up over them and they will go away a lot faster. Try to wash your face and use a moisturizer everyday to get moisture back in to your skin. Vaseline works great for dry skin. I use it on my face but I take a dump towel and take most of it off. But make sure you leave some in your skin. You'll see the difference;)|`|czBiPIVBaa	there probably isn't anything you can do about your freckles, look at lindsay lohan she just covers them up. if you have dry skin try using a moisterizer after you wash your face, but before you go to sleep i would put on spot cream for your pimples and then wash it off in the morning. proactiv works great but also really expensive.|`|t1QtLK4oaa	try the philosophy products. they made a great cleanser called: "purity made simple" which is the greatest.

First find out what kind of skin you have (sensitive or regular). Then find a moisturizer that fits your skin and budget. For sensitive skin try Aveeno, it's natural and very gentle. If your problem continues you should try changing your makeup, I find that sometimes the ingredients can agitate your skin. You also have too realize if the problem continues that it may just be something that you were born with that you can lessen a bit but will be with you all of your life.|`|U3yCdw6Yaa	I just use dove soap on my face and receive many compliments that I have such beautiful skin so maybe you should change your soap.  If that is not an option or does not work, my cousin was having the same problem and started using proactive which cleared her face up immediately.

If you have pimples all the time, it is acne... There are many different forms of it. You should see your doc, he can fix it.|`|6qhvnWWTaa	I know you said not to do this but...<br>  I'm no doctor or anything but from past experiences i've gotten lots of break outs from wearing to much make-up. What all that make-up does is go into the pores on your face and clog them right up causing break outs. Did you ever think about that at the end of the day all your eye shadow comes off? It's because most of it goes into your pores/rubs off. If you really want to wear make-up to cover up your freckles I say get a make-up that has some sort of acne medication in it. I know Proactiv makes make-up and it doesn't clog your pores at all! It can be really expensive though. If none of this helps I say talk to your doctor and they can put you on some great medications to help get rid of your acne. What I always do when I come home from school is wipe my whole face with an oil absorbing **** from Clean and Clear. It takes it right off so it prevents excess oil causing more break outs.|`|7oYsjoJsaa	I have almost the same prob minus the freckles, but really your best bet is getting the makeup called "Physicians Formula"  it's good for yours skin and it covers the blemishes really well and it doesn't dry your skin out. It's pretty pricey but it's all worth it to look good; lol. But, I would try also for the dry skin getting an oil free moisturizer and while your home with no makeup on put a lot on and just let it sit there and soak into the dry skin. Also the concealer that most girls use is very heavy and can keep the blemishes from going away. When I do my morning makeup routine I usually started with a "tinted moisturizer" it's by the brand i suggested above, it leaves your skin smooth and even to put a power foundation on top of it or whatever will cover your freckles. They also make a concealer stick that you should use. All their products are organic and good for your skin. You should try it.|`|Qb4P6ruEaa	Umm, well i kinda sorta had the same problem. <br>  First off i don't think you need some super expensive treatment to make your skin look good. You can do a few simple things before bed & in the morning to improve it; but if you MUST Proactiv is really really good.<br>  Anyways, use an oil-free acne wash to wash your face in the mornings and at night. After washing it, apply a LIGHT moisturizer. Noo thick cream cuz it could clog up pores. & instead of layering on the make up, use a a tinted moisturizer for all over coverage & dust on transluscent powder &/or blush if you wear any (keep it natural, use mineral based powders instead of icky artificial stuff.)<br>  Good luck (:

Its great! sooo easy and fast, and it doesn't get all over your fingers. Here is a picture of it: <a href="http://s2.thisnext.com/media/230x230_no_border/MAC-187-Duo-Fibre-Brush_A0E9C920.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s2.thisnext.com/media/230x230_no_...</a> . MAC brushes have a lifetime warranty, so even though they are expensive, they are worth it!

The brush costs $42 at Macy's and at the MAC website (free shipping online, so you could also order it from there. maccosmetics.com . <br>  <br>  If you don't want to buy the brush, I imagine that doing these things could help:<br>  <br>  -make sure that your skin is very moisturized before putting your foundation on<br>  <br>  -try exfoliating your face in the shower (if you don't already) to make sure you don't have any dry patches, which could also lead to streaking. <br>  <br>  Hope my answer helped!

But, I can't wax. waxing hurts me more than it did when my kneecap and jaw dislocated.  I can't bare that kind of pain.  I tried getting that one crystal thing from that infomercial.  you know how you can buff off the hair.  BUT it only works for my legs but takes FOREVER to get your legs smooth with it, then it's hairy again the next day.  so, I stick to shaving.  and when I shave, now I have razor bumps that don't go away now.   I don't know how to rid of them.  :(|`|lFdWmDjGaa	I don't have that problem but here is a website that can maybe help you out.<br>  <a href="http://www.101lifestyle.com/beauty/bodycare/body/bodyhair.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.101lifestyle.com/beauty/bodyc...</a><br>  <br>  try some of those and see if it works.|`|PVItj3pMaa	me too.

s38ToTNSaa	You can get it pierced right away if it isn't in the exact spot. But if you would like to have it in the same place i would wait until it is completely or close to healed. So if you are getting it lowered i don't think you would have to wait maybe just a week or 2 so the hole is smaller.
5RoYyprkaa	If the holes have already closed, then you can get another piercing. I had my ears pierced three times also, and two of mine grew up. As soon as I couldn't stick an earring in them, I had them redone. The fleshy part of your ears should be ok if you want to go ahead and pierce them now.|`|gxiKIQIiaa	Yes you can nothing t worry about get a new piercing whenever you want!|`|aRZXo0vXaa	Wait for the holes to close up, once they have, you should be ready to get them pierced again, but get them pierced with gold, your ears with be healthier in the long run.|`|w98srjRnaa	yes you can
3q7x0Zfwaa	If you grow it out. I had a perm from 5th grade to my 1st year of college. It took me a while to grow it all out but it has basically returned to normal.<br>  <br>  Here's a thought: Instead of getting a curly perm, curl it yourself for special occasions. Instead of getting a straight perm, flat iron it staight every once in a while. Best of both worlds!|`|bgdjtJepaa	I used to perm straighten my hair (which I should not have done since the product is meant for African hair, and much too strong for mine--talk about dead ends!), and it went back to normal.  My hair is still curly.  Quite curly.  I just straighten it now.  But if you're straight haired and going for curly, it's not as easy to just fix it each day so a perm is indeed a good idea.  No worries, your hair will go back to normal.  Don't let anyone scare you into thinking otherwise.|`|PMuAITczaa	Yeah, you can grow it out and i think you can also get a hair treatment that gets rid of it quicker, my mum had a perm like 20 years ago apparently and now her hair is really straight! x|`|htx3jtoJaa	i got a perm and it look really good but them i got tired of it so i got a relaxer and it's still not back to normal|`|lcgN6gkSaa	you can get a perm but you'll have to  use some kind of shampoo to get your hair back to normal.

Just walking around the neighborhood every day does good!  5, weigh yourself frequently. You may not like the speed of the process but it will work.     Way to want  to be healthy! Good luck!

AA11755678	Most drug store shampoos are petroleum base. Alot of Salon products are too.

Different shampoos contain different things so rather than using and buying the same type of shampoo month after month every time one runs out buy something new.  I guarantee that when you use this new shampoo for the first time your hair will feel amazing.    This is the trick the salons use to sell you their expensive stuff because they put it in once and yeah your hair feels amazing because it has that build up washed away, but keep using the expensive one for a month and it will leave just as much of a build up.  It is all just a trick.|`|84aaff49f616c91b6c0f6b314d4e7c3faa	I would say Head & Shoulders, because they are the only brand of shampoo that doesnt screw up my hair and ALSO removes dandruff.    =P  Hope that helps a TINY bit, at least.|`|a74193eb64d23f96acf91f2efccc6a61aa	yellow sunsilk  its awesome!  smells good, gives my hear volume, and affordable!!

83ef54edba46f299b38cd9ae8185efc0aa	Oh the memories of my first Tampon experience haha.  No, pulling them out does not hurt, it can be a itsybitsy uncomfortable, but nothing painful.  Sleeping with one is AOK, but sometimes if your on your 'heavy flow days', you may want to wear a panty liner while sleeping, sometimes they can leak.  Just make sure you DON'T leave the same one in the whole day!!  But, yes, you can sleep in one, no problem what so ever.  And now you can go swimming as well!!!|`|AA12261175	Here's a trick that works for removing tampons as well as accepting the speculum:  relax the muscles by exhaling!  A female gyno taught me that- deep breath in, deep breath out and you're good to go.|`|AA11189151	You can go ahead and sleep without any problem. Getting it out isn't hard. Just pull on the string slowly and let it come out. No worries.|`|2df96a8985c441398f2a42a1b8a80828aa	Do you not have a mother with which to discuss such matters?  Or a big sister?  Or an aunt?

I mean, do you really think this is the absolutely best forum to ask questions concerning feminine hygene products?|`|AA12292034	i've always slept with them in. its much better than a pad.  just gently pull the string and it comes out. change it every 2-4 hours, depending on how heavy you bleed.  congrats. i know how i felt when i started using tampons long ago.|`|7ebf8bf641846ee1a649bfd10cf1500eaa	To get it out just give the string a pull. You should only keep one i for a maximum of 5 hours. It is advised not to sleep with one in.|`|AA10262134	If it hurts taking it out, then it hasn't absorbed as much "liquid" as it should, and probably needs to stay in a bit longer.    As long as it doesn't stay in 8 hours or more you should be fine, but read the side effects on the insert and memorize the symptoms of Toxic Shock Syndrome. If you start having any of these symptoms, remove the tampon immediately and seek medical help|`|AA11519038	i've heard you're not suppose to sleep with one. but when you take one out, make sure your muscles are relaxed. it wouldn't come out unless you're relaxed. good luck nd congrats lol|`|ccb506e490fc6ea6812b19d4dfc8c70aaa	well i havent started my period yet but im ganna stick to pads for the rest of my life unless i feel the need to wear tampons. one got lost in my moms body and she had to get it surgically removed. so be careful|`|AA11403383	WELL B*TCH aunt flow has just came to town i see and u wann know how put a tampon in that crevice. first you clean ur vagina cheese also known as vaginal secretion, next insert your ******* femtex or playtex or w/e **** it is, then take the plastic mutha f*ucka out and then u have a white cotton with a string, yank that  mo fo put and its as clean as a whistle, hey try whistling out of your lips. well have fun cleaning the mess santa made|`|f4061abd5bc8d6c519f8aa9ffd26e55baa	Getting it out isn't any problem, just tug on the string and pull it out slowly. I wouldn't suggest that you sleep with one in. I would also suggest that you don't use super max or deoderant tampons either. Even though toxic shock syndrome isn't a very publicized illness, my aunt died from it so just be sensible! good luck

Coma de 3 em 3 horas (caf da manh?-lache-almo?o-lanche-janta-lanche) e antes de dormir come um mingau que gostar (aveia, maizena - Os derivados de leite permanecem mais tempo no organismo e diminui a queima acelerada de calorias).  4o N?o coma salada separado da comida, coma junto. Se gosta de nutri ou outros alimentos com muitas fibras, gr?os, coma acompanhando uma fruta.  5o Os lanches n?o devem ser gordurosos, nem t?o doces para nao acarretar outras doen?as.    Para quem quer emagrecer Sabia que  a mesma coisa? Tem que se alimentar de 3 em 3 horas, claro que o cardpio dever ser mais leve. Aliado a exerccios fsicos. Quando mais ficar sem comer o corpo vai armazenar a gordura porque ele n?o sabe quando vem comida de novo. E a engorda. Jejuar engorda, e fica obeso! N?o engorda com sade e nem emagrece!|`|d9d0a06dd2d0eb072a9811baf7560672aa	TOME BIONTOUR FONTORA|`|6d22f03ca3ea4e72981f3d343065cfb1aa	e melhor procurar um medico|`|0e0b3e83f5bf8bfac457690153f0072faa	O melhor  procurar um nutricionista, melhor ganhar massa muscular do q gordura...alimentos lipdicos e ricos em carboigratos s?o os que engordam!|`|4d466488c98e69f632c87bb39a444cc1aa	Procure um mdico, n?o fa?a nada s/ recomenda??o mdica, o melhor, pra come?ar  reeduca??o alimentar.|`|fb1ce36bf193cad7d01ad69e1beb5d6daa	Sorvete.

Manter a freqncia de refei??es (como caf da manh?, almo?o e jantar), mantendo os horrios padr?es que voc estipular. Depois de um tempo, voc comer por hbito.   Comer devagar, num local tranqilo, sem barulho. Se n?o for possvel, enquanto comer tente se concentrar na comida e no ato de se alimentar.   Enriquecer todas as refei??es habituais, em termos de valor calrico. Se, por exemplo, voc toma leite de manh?, enrique?a-o com mel, frutas, e/ou cereais, e assim por diante.   Evite comer fora do horrio. Algumas pessoas perdem a fome se comerem algo antes do almo?o. Prefira fazer poucas refei??es, mas bem feitas.   Tomar gua em pequenas quantidades durante todo o dia. Num total de, pelo menos, 2 litros. Mas prefira gua aos refrigerantes, que n?o s?o bons para o organismo.   Durante a refei??o n?o beba lquido. Ele atrapalha a mastiga??o, que prepara o alimento e o aparelho digestivo para a digest?o.   Voc pode usar suplementos alimentares, mas prefira os mais naturais que s?o vendidos em supermercados (como granola, neston, etc) e n?o use indiscriminadamente. Tudo em excesso pode fazer mal.   Manter o consumo de frutas e verduras que v?o normalizar o organismo para que ele absorva melhor os alimentos.   Tomar, at meia hora antes da refei??o, um copo de suco de lim?o ou laranja, ou comer um peda?o de ma??. Abre o apetite e retm mais os sais minerais.   Importante: n?o tente ganhar peso rpido, isto pode trazer problemas de sade para voc.|`|68eaa34ec87ffd86a340316ea41621f0aa	Ol.

Also they do add length, but its not just the colour its the way you paint them.  you can't really cover the whole nail, try to aviod the sides but dont aviod them all together.  Lighter colours are great too like pale pink or white, they can be painted any how, just watch out for streaks.  Streaks on nails show up with bright colours all the time, so if you go something like pale pink first coat your nails with a clear polish to prevent the ugly streaks.    Bold colours like orange and other neon colour can bring lots of attention to your nails so i suggest if you have some longer than others its not a good idea.  Also usually they look bad on long nails anyway.   good luck with your nails. =)|`|5gVcEIPWaa	you can do a french manicure no matter how long ur nails are just paint on where the white part would be. but i've found that lighter colors make your nails look longer while darker or more bold colors make them look shorter.|`|vfm1rEF2aa	First of all, congratulations! :) I too was a nail biter and last year I finally kicked the habit and it was tough but I love my nails now and you will love yours. For colors, I played it safe at first with light pinks but now I'm branching out. My advice is, go with what you like! I think nails are so much fun and a great form of expression. I paint mine every color under the sun from sparkly black to hot pink to white. As for colors vs. length, I guess sometimes lighter colors can make nails appear to look shorter because they aren't drawing as much attention to the nail, you know? But the good thing about shorter nails is that In my opinion every color looks great, as I personally thing that if you have longer nails, some colors might not look that flattering. Good luck!

A razor cut is that choppy cut you want, I believe. Now, I don't advize that you cut it yourself but you ask someone with more experience to do it for you.    And to do that, you need to get some hair from the top of your head and cut it a bit short. About 1-4 inches should be enough hair up there.  Then you get a comb and "tease" your hair, which is basically back combing your hair really quickly.    And make sure to put on lots of hairspray to keep the hold. And of course angle your bangs to the side!    Voila! Emo hair :D|`|L3z7IIISaa	if ur hair is short just wake up run ur fingers through it a little, then shake ur head.

9b416c92ae5716a074372245b794a9ffaa	clothes shopping is FUNNN!! i went shopping for spring and summer clothes about a month ago but it hasn't warmed up enough for me to wear them yet. anyways, heres what you should look for...    i think you should try on a pair of bermuda shorts. but they don't look good on all body types, so if you don't like how they look on you, don't buy them. but if they do look good on you, go ahead. i like the plaid ones that are in right now but i also have a pair of cargo ones and plain denim ones.     http://www3.jcpenney.com/jcp/Products.as...     jean mini skirts are are in right now to, so try to look for one of those. but a lot of the mini skirts that are popular right now are reallly short, so make sure you find one of the right length. and i would suggest wearing shorts underneath. they won't show and it will make you feel more confident, you won't have to keep trying to hide. some skirts have shorts built in. i still can't find a denim mini skirt that fits, cuz i have long legs. my mom won't let me get one because she says they are to short, but she is getting more overprotective lately and its annoying me. so i only have one skirt right now, and its almost knee length. but its still cute so yeah.    http://www.oldnavy.com/browse/product.do...     for shorts, try to stay away from the really short ones unless you have the right body for them. i used to be able to wear them, but then my legs grew a lot so if i wear them they show to much. i try to find some with about 3 inches of length. depending on your body type, its acceptable to wear shorts with a length from 2 inches to knee length [bermuda]. if you find some you like but you think they are a little long, you can roll them up, thats really hot right now.     http://www.oldnavy.com/browse/product.do...     right now polka dots and puff sleeves are popular for tops. if you have broad shoulders like me then you should stay away from the puff sleeves since they make them look broader. halter tops can make broad shoulders look smaller. also, you can't go wrong with polo shirts and henleys. and make sure you have camis to layer underneath your polos and henleys. the colors i like to have are blue, green, pink, white, and brown, that way i have one to go with everthing. and camis are very nessesary for me since i layer my clothing a lot. if you don't like the layered look then you won't need as many camis, but they are good to have. in the summer you'll be able to wear them without another layer overtop.    http://www.oldnavy.com/browse/product.do...     http://www.kohls.com/products/product_pa...     http://www.kohls.com/products/product_pa...     the shoes you should look for are flip flops, wedge sandals, and ballet flats. peeptoe sandals are hot right now, so i'd suggest buying a pair. try a pair with a wedge heel, but not a giant heel or your feet will hurt. hot topic has really cute ballet flats, and even though the store might seem scary at first, once you go inside you won't be scared anymore. and its totally worth it cuz the shoes are really cute. the first couple times you wear ballet flats you might get blisters, but once you get them broken in they will be comfortable.     http://www.kohls.com/products/product_pa...     http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/store/p...     righ now tote bags are in. so are bags with lots of pockets.     http://www.aeropostale.com/product/index...     http://www.oldnavy.com/browse/product.do...     good luck shopping!! have fun!!|`|4f8dbbfb64ceb84ed6b301fd2ce9a489aa	inexpensive places to find trendy pieces- Rue 21, H&M, forever 21, Macy's, Old Navy, Gap, AE, Wet Seal, Aeropostale.

E ns temos centros de energia, centros de for?as chamados chakras, onde captamos e transmitimos energia.    Usar um piercing num local de chackras bloqueia as energias, vc deixa de capatar as energias boas do UNIVERSO. E futuramente pode ter problemas de sade no local. O que pode demorar bastante.

Ns espritas, sabemos que existem falanges de espritos maus, que est?o incentivando as pessoas principalmente os jovens a aderir este apetrecho, para prejudicar o futuro da humanindade na Terra.    Realmente existe motivo para preocupa??o!    Daqui a alguns anos, muitos jovens v?o sofrer as consequnicas e n?o saber?o nem porqu est?o passando por estes problemas.    Acredite se quizer.

Voce deve estar ciente de que uma lente de contato  um corpo estranho ao seu organismo, portanto o seu sistema imunologico a principio deveria reagir contra as lentes. Entretanto existem materias que retardam ou fazem com que o sistema imunologico nao reconhecam as lesntes como corpo entranho ao organismos e com isso haja uma rea??o alergica. Bem mas bacterias sao reconhecidas certamente como alvo do sistema imunologico e sao contra elas que nos que usamos lentes devemos lutar. Podemos usar lentes todos os dias sim desde que nos preocupemos com a limpeza delas com substrancia esterelizandes e nao apenas soro fisiologico. Vale dizer que o soro apenas lava as lentes e nao  um agente bactericita. Depois de uma semana aberto o soro esta contaminado com bacterias do ambiente e entao server de contamindador e nao de "limpador" de lentes. Abracos
N70MXGx5aa	I used to be under that awful spell of propping the elbows on furniture, and had those ugly black dots on my lower arm area, too. However, it vanished very gradually, as gradually I learnt to NOT keep my elbows like that. Also, whenever I take a shower, I scrub the spotted area and my elbows thoroughly.  Yes, moisturising is a good idea, too, as it softens the elbows. However, just like moisturising any other part of the body, the suppleness is only temporary. So you just have to keep doing it!    As for the pigmentation problem in the area, it is either due to excessive dryness of the skin or a hereditory factor. If it is the latter, thank your parents for this wonderful gift.|`|AA10855386	Just dont prop up your elbows like your granny does. And keep on applying the lotion.

A dica  dormir com touca de meia, n?o lavar a noite e nunca usar condicionador ou cremes nas tran?as, pois alem de n?o ser necessrio, pode causar caspas ou at seborria e ainda ajuda a desfazer mais rpido.  Como se lava o cabelo tran?ado?  Com as pontas dos dedos, somente com shampoo se conseguir, para que dure mais num intervalo maior de tempo.

AA12069069	I would say moolatte's and frappacino's are about the same fattening. Some non-fattening drinks are water, juices, and stuff with low sugar like teas.

Green tea and water, of course, are not fattening. Diet sodas and diet iced teas tend to have zero calories--as compared to their regular counterparts, which have 250+ calories. And juices, like orange juice and apple juice, while somewhat better for you than soda, are also loaded with sugar. Try to stick to freshly squeezed juices, vitamin water, diet drinks.

The best way is to make the growth better instead of using artificial items to highlight your eyebrows.    Use wheatgerm oil or castor oil or olive oil and massage a little.     Now give a hot oil treatment. To do this you put towel in hot water, rinse it and apply carefully on the eyebrows after massaging with oil. Do this for about 5-6 times till all oil is absorbed.    Your growth of hair will improve a lot. Also shape your eyebrows in such a manner that it doesn't look too thin, but looks attractive. Remove the unwanted hair by threading. Dont do it yourself but get it done by an expert beautician.

Black wouldn't go as well with this outfit because it will tone down the outfit and bring a very sober mood to something that is obviously supposed to be fun.

For example if is set in the morning you would be cleaning so a plain grey or light blue dress with a plain (no frills) apron and maybe a mob cap would be appropriate. If in the evening or you are serving at a table, a long black dress ,long sleeves white collar and cuffs and a fancier apron and cap. I once worked as a maid in a private hotel and we had three basic uniforms, morning (when we cleaned the rooms) plain pink dress and grey aprons  afternoon was for lighter cleaning in public areas we wore a 3/4 length black dress and plain white bib apron, plain white cap, for the evenings in the dining room we wore full length black dress white collar and cuffs, white lace cap and full length pinafore style apron.

z9yUGK0Raa	layers don't necessarily make hair thicker - they're used a LOT for making hair thinner without thinning it out!  layers can be used to add or take away weight.  ask your stylist for long layers next time you go in.    AND stop using the wet-to-straight.  it's absolutely TERRIBLE for your hair.  don't believe me?  ask your stylist when you go in.    you need a decent shampoo and conditioner.  try paul mitchell super skinny shampoo and conditioner and super skinny serum - time saving, and amazing.  invest in a blow-comb attachment for your blowdryer, and get a better flat iron.  try paul mitchell, rusk, fhi or chi.  my paul mitchell iron heats up to 400 degrees - meaning you just swipe it down the strand once and it's bone straight!  it's also ceramic, so it's way less damaging.  beware of cheap "ceramic" irons - they're only coated with ceramic, which wears off onto your hair!    and remember - salon products are 100% guaranteed only when sold by a professional - not meijers, target, or walmart!    don't be concerned with having "too much" - you'll probably look much better with more of a style than you have now.    hope this helps|`|FlXOZ7IAaa	See a professional hair stylist and consult with them about thinning your hair.

You can ask your doctor, who has been charting your weight and height since you were young.|`|lYDsZZk6aa	i think its not possible.... love yourself as you are... :)  it will solve your problem|`|puggO1EGaa	here are the Six ways to boost growth hormone output naturally          Size may matter, but in some cases the smallest thing can have the biggest impact.  Like that grape-sized organ- the anterior pituitary gland- nestled within your brain.  Despite its small dimensions, it is the source of powerful juice when it comes to building height.  You see, the anterior pituitary gland is responsible for secreting a substance called somatotropic hormone, more commonly known as "growth hormone," into your bloodstream.          Without that tiny gland, it wouldn't matter how many reps of stretching exercises you perform.  Without it, building your physique would become an exercise in futility.  Why?  "It's somatotropic hormone that dictates how your body will adapt itself from all your height increasing efforts" says Ed Burke, Ph.D., director of the Exercise Science Program at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs.          Acting as your body's foreman, growth hormone instructs your skeletal bone to grow larger and stronger while it speeds the conversion of excess fats into energy.  In other words, get enough growth hormone floating around in your system and your body has no choice but to construct itself into something bigger and badder.  Cheat yourself from acquiring your fair share and your body can only do so much, no matter how much you do.          Although the amount of growth hormone your body regularly produces is entirely up to your brain, there are a few things you can do to trick that thrifty gland into being a bit more generous.          So now that you've worked hard enough on your body performing the stretching exercises, pay attention to these six proven ways to make your body work for you:          1)Get your shut-eye.  It's simple math really.  Add eight hours to the time you went to bed, then look at your alarm clock before peeling yourself from the sheets.  "Not getting enough sleep regularly can lower the amount of growth hormone your body produces daily," says Walter Thompson, Ph.D., director of the Center for Sports Medicine, Science and Technology at Georgia State University in Atlanta.          Even though excess sleep won't necessarily increase the amount of growth hormone your body secretes, constantly burning your midnight oil could be suppressing how efficiently your body distributes growth hormone during the course of the day.  Keeping normal sleeping habits may let you tap into a certain percentage of growth hormone that your bones never get a chance to utilize when sleep-deprived.*          2)Eat Smarter.  Focus on eating six or seven smaller meals during your day instead of three or four larger ones.  Consuming large meals with a high glycemic index forces the body to release a high amount of insulin into the system to aid with digestion.  This reaction not only forces your body to store fat, it may also inhibit the flow of the growth hormone being released throughout your bloodstream.  Instead, make a point of consuming other low-sugar foods that will prevent the release of insulin.          The crossover between what you need to stay healthy and what you need to release more growth hormone doesn't stop with eating smaller meals and getting enough shut-eye.  All of the same factors that need to be in place for a healthy lifestyle still hold true.  Training right, eating right, sleeping right and keeping your stress to a minimum will not only keep you healthier, they will foster the type of environment that encourages the anterior pituitary gland to do its job.  Deficits in any of these areas will only slow down how well your body functions as a whole, which in turn slow down the amount of growth hormone that is being continually pumped into your system.*          3)  Pre-workout nosh: Toss back a small chicken salad sandwich a couple of hours before you exercise.  Food Researchers have discovered that consuming a protein-carbohydrate meal two hours prior to working out and another meal immediately afterward elicited a significant increase in both growth hormone an testosterone within the bloodstream.          Even if you're not hungry a few hours before you exercise, you may want to consider having a snack to prevent being hungry within the two-hour window before you work out.  Researchers at UCLA found that subjects who exercised with partially digested food in their stomachs experienced up to a 54 percent decrease in the production of growth hormone.  Subjects who were fed strictly carbohydrates prior to a workout still experienced a lower production of growth hormone by up to 24 percent.*~          4) Get the most from your training: What you put your body through during your stretching exercise routine has a direct effect on what your pituitary gland puts out to build height.  A recent study in the Journal of Applied Physiology found that the frequency and amount of growth hormone the body secretes is relative to the intensity of your workout.  Subjects who exercised at a higher intensity experienced greater and more frequent releases of growth hormone after their workouts.          To get the most from your training efforts, you need to be sure that the duration and intensity of your regimen are high enough to elicit a response.  Keeping your workouts focused on short-burst, high intensity anaerobic stretching exercises and maintaining a pace that lasts at least 20-30 minutes is a fair standard to follow.          There are certain stretching exercises that may help squeeze out a little extra growth hormone.  By utilizing stretches that include several muscle groups to work collectively, the intensity of the workout subsequently increases as well, forcing the anterior pituitary gland to issue more growth hormone to compensate for the extra effort.          Oddly enough, participating in intense aerobic exercise can also cause an in|`|VHIQJwaFaa	yea generally boys dont stop growing till about early 20's|`|bc5e848b650f7c23320e43210b9e4538aa	well look at yourself, do you see more of your mother or father features. if you see more of your mother you would probly grow like 2-4 inches before you stop growing.if you see more of your father you would grow 3-5|`|7af2a8e4de25957ebcd72404b71d30dfaa	i htink its impossible to stop ur growth|`|UNuMWSq1aa	I'm not sure but right now I'm 14 and 5 7. my dad is 5 8 my sis is 5 6 but my mom is 5 4.

Para darle brillo, usa aceite de oliva, una vez a la semana, cuando ests en casa tranquila, te lo colocas y te pones un gorro plstico para ayudarlo a actuar.  La grasa es un problema que no se como resolver, yo tambien lo tengo graso y mi cabello est impecable todo el tiempo, ya que lo lavo al menos dos veces al dia. Me han dicho que mientras mas lo lave, mas grasa tendr, pero eso no lo sabr porque no dejar de lavarlo. Eso no me afecta, ya que tengo el cabello totalmente natural y mientras mas lo lavo, mas hermoso se ve.  Si buscas alisarlo, deber ser con calor, cepillo y secador, plancha, etc.... y con eso solo logrars resecarlo mas.  Por qu no lo llevas natural, le sacas el mejor partido con un buen corte y trabajas por el momento en erradicar la caspa que es tu principal problema?

Para la caspa lo mejor es que cepilles bien el cabello para eliminar todas las partculas (lo ideal sera que lo hicieras con un cepillo de cerdas naturales) y a continuacin te laves el pelo con un buen champ anticaspa (te recomiendo HS, es el mejor que hay ahora mismo en el mercado).Hay algunos champs que son para caspa, grasa y seborrea.Pregunta en tu farmacia porque con ese champ atacaras los tres problemas de una sola vez.Para el alisado del cabello, te recomiendo el champ Elvive Liso con su crema suavizante y mascarilla, tambin tienes el serum que te lo deja bastante liso y te evita la sequedad.Para alisarlo tienes unos cepillos con agujeritos (los venden en cualquier droguera) con los que te peinas mientras vas secando el pelo con el secador e introduciendo el aire caliente por los agujeritos del cepillo.Este cepillo tiene cerdas naturales, por lo que consigues alisarlo y dejarlo brillante a la vez.  Para evitar tener que estar alisndote el pelo tan a menudo y terminar con el problema de una vez, si tienes el pelo fuerte y nada quebradizo, puedes ponerte en manos de un buen peluquero y hacerte el alisado japons.Una amiga ma se lo ha hecho y el resultado ha sido realmente espectacular, no se le mueve ni un pelo de su sitio, siempre est liso y fantstico y no ha sufrido da?os, pero debes asegurarte de que tu pelo est sano para hacrtelo.Te aseguro que es el mtodo ms eficaz y de mejores resultados.

Consintalo. Para reactivar el crecimiento, dse un masaje suave con la yema de los dedos desde la nuca hasta la frente.    2. Lavado ideal. Adems del champ, todos los tipos de pelo necesitan un acondicionador y un tratamiento adaptado a sus caractersticas y necesidades. Aplquelo una vez por semana.    3. Agua perfecta. Empiece a lavar su cabeza con agua templada y termine con agua muy fra. As aportar brillo y fuerza a su peinado. El agua hirviendo lo debilita.     4. Secar y peinar con suavidad. Para secar el cabello recin lavado basta con presionarlo con la toalla hasta absorber el exceso de humedad. Solo utilice secadores y planchas cuando sea imprescindible y siempre a temperatura media.     5. Desenredo. Desenrede el pelo con cuidado para que no se rompa. Si lo tiene graso, invierta en peinillas de madera y cepillos con cerdas naturales.    6. Un buen corte. No vaya a la peluquera slo en casos extremos. El pelo tiene que revitalizarse. Lo ms conveniente es cortar las puntas cada seis u ocho semanas.    7. Un toque brillante. Para conseguirlo puede extender leche condensada por el cabello antes de enjuagarlo y luego pasar un cubo de hielo por las mechas. Otra opcin es preparar una mascarilla con aceite de germen de trigo. En el lavado, retrela con agua y un chorro de vinagre de manzana.    8. Para cabellos grasos. Es el tipo de pelo ms frecuente. Si es una de las afectadas, enfrente la grasa aplicando un poco de zumo de limn en el ltimo enjuague. Tambin puede utilizar levadura de cerveza. Y, aunque parezca sorprendente, masajear el cuero cabelludo con aceite. Eso s, esto ltimo con moderacin: slo una vez por semana.    9. Acabe con la sequedad. Mezcle dos yemas de huevo, una cucharadita de ron y otra de aceite de ricino. Deje actuar la mezcla en el pelo unos minutos, lvelo muy bien ?y listo!    10. Ms oscuros. Ponga a hervir en una ollita un pu?ado de hojas de romero frescas picadas con dos tazas de agua. Espere cinco minutos ms antes de retirar la preparacin e introdzcala en un recipiente con difusor. Consrvelo en la nevera para rociarlo en el cabello.     11. Con toques rojos. Si quiere que su cabello tenga reflejos rojizos, antes de probar con las mechas empiece usando infusiones de t rojo en el enjuague.    12. Adis a la caspa. Hierva 50 gramos de hojas frescas de perejil y cuando enfre la infusin, riguela por el cuero cabelludo. Importante: no enjuague el pelo, simplemente squelo.    13. Rizos bajo control. Aplique clara de huevo sobre el cabello para definir su forma.     14. Te?ido, pero sano. Mantenga su color en perfecto estado mezclando leche de almendras, esencia de canela y unas gotas de limn.     15. Te?ir en casa. Lo primero que tiene que hacer es aislar el contorno del cuero cabelludo y las orejas con vaselina o crema. Si se le olvid y se le mancha la piel, frote las manchitas con un algodn empapado con champ y alcohol. Tenga cuidado con sus ojos.|`|49a9ddf502f371376597ae625ee4ab96aa	Puedes utilizar shampoos para cabello graso y lavarlo mas a diario...  Y para alisarlo....Las planchas o sin el secador.

i9PfjsoHaa	Hmm, pues mira, por lo menos s qu ejercicios no se deberan hacer: ni natacin, ni pesas o cualquier tipo de ejercicio de peso como los aparatos de los gimnasios.  Si se trata de unos kiliux de ms, pues es mejor un ejercicio aerbico, baile, etc. que no aumentan la masa corporal.  Tener una buena postura es una buena medida para disimular un poco pues alarga la figura, para contrastar.  Tambin hay ropa favorecedora, como por ejemplo prendas superiores no muy cortas, evitar los estraples y de preferencia usar mangas, puede usarse un escote que muestre la clavcula; claro evitar tambin las rayas horizontales en tu prenda superior y mejor llamar la atencin a la prenda inferior.   Otros tips, arreglar el cabello y la cara para llamar la atencin, usar collares largos y/o pa?oletas a modo de crear una linea central descendente que estilice.   Espero que esto de algo sirva para responder tu pregunta!|`|JnJhXAjlaa	si tienes la espalda ancha resignate por que son huesos y los huesos no los podras reducir jamas, lo que podrias rebajar es la grasita que se acumula en los brazos que hacen ver aun mas ancha la espalda. yo tengo mas ancha la espalda que las caderas y parecia una "v" pero entre a clases de yoga y toda la grasa acumulada en los brazos desaparecio por que ahi no haces musculo y no cambie del todo pero ya no me veo tan mal.|`|uxfl0SaYaa	Ya eres un ropero, confrmate.|`|8d1a76beee0addda6258f229b007770daa	no, ya eso es problema de la naturaleza y del cuerpo, si tienes la espalda ancha, te aconsejo que no hagas ejercicios porque se te van a poner peor.|`|O4tTDHLOaa	La espalda ancha, salvo en casos extremos de obesidad, est determinada por la forma del esqueleto propia de esa persona.  No hay forma de reducir el ancho o el largo del esqueleto.  Lo que s se puede reducir es el excesivo valor o importancia que alguien podra darle al hecho insignificante de tener la espalda un poco ms ancha que el promedio.  Ninguna de las personas que dej algo valioso en su paso por la vida lo atribuy jams a las medidas de su espalda.  Excepto Atlas, que cargaba el mundo en su espalda. Pero en ese caso, su virtud era tener espalda ancha. Saludos.|`|c4620c994928a92721293a13e460108aaa	La mejor solucin es conformarce con lo que la naturaleza te ha dado, disfruta de tu cuerpo tal como es y no te comas el "tarro"
i9PfjsoHaa	Yo dira que el halter. Es mi favorito. En general los escotes y cuellos en V son ms favorecedores para cualquier tipo de cuerpo y ms sugestivos que los dems.  Sin embargo depende de con qu te sientas ms cmoda, que es lo importante para que uno se desenvuelva ms segura de s que al final, me parece, es lo ms sexy.

Si tienes poco busto hace que se "vea ms", si tienes regular lo aumenta, y si a eso le sumas que el canalillo (linea que se forma entre los senos) se marque ms.... queda muy bien. Adems, un buen halter deja la espalda al decubierto, as como los huesitos de los hombros que a todas nos gusta que se nos vean.

AA12179469	They were when I was in school. Have no idea why they wouldn't be now.|`|S9S86LZBaa	I don't know... I mean, this one girl always wears tank tops even after the teachers clearly told her not to. We only wear those mostly to attract boys, and school is a learning place... I think thats why. Also, some people wear really innappropriate things that distract others.|`|lK3ORZLtaa	Well i guess some teachers dont feel comfortable around kids with tank tops|`|e824144493e2b6705efb7ca0ec209de1aa	not really. sometimes they can be a little revealing cuz people make em so low cut these days.|`|434dcd0a69177d4fce0fa74e7a26157caa	it depends. tank tops that show the belly, cleavage, low back, etc. really shouldn't be allowed. it looks inappropriate and cheap. other tank tops that don't seem like a distraction should be allowed, especially on hot days. how do they expect people to stand the heat?!|`|9556ce3b5bbc6563054ca4da2c6f3a96aa	I think modest ones could be allowed.

Schools are air-conditioned so there is no need to wear them other than for fashion purposes.  It is very distracting for adolescent boys with raging hormones when girls walk around with skin showing.  School is for learning, you can be "cute" and "cool" etc. when hanging out with your friends.|`|042e4e1dd53978d67c7aca9f24b1ef67aa	for sure.. I am in High School and some are allowed.. I guess is depends what grade level you are. I did have some anger in my school when I was in Elementary school , girls in grade 2 wear tube tops and the teachers said nothing but when the older girls did we were asked to change. I think that its everyone or no one.|`|SPUqtbcZaa	I think that they should be, only because my school doesn't have air conditioning, except in the main office, and even wearing a t-shirt makes you feel like you're dying in the heat. They should be allowed in the month or two before you get out of school and the month after you start school, until it starts to cool down a little.

L3z7IIISaa	Baby oil is a known cause of hair lose. Dont use baby oil!  My sister used to use it and her hair was picky after that, it was bad!  eating, & stress can cause it but not as much as baby oil.  if you have dry hair use leave in conditioners.  Read the directions and use them almost everyday after a shampoo.  ?|`|U6XnPvO9aa	a poor diet does play a part in hair loss,..i don't think the baby oil has anything to do with it.  there is also a hair disease called alopecia areata, you might have that if the hair loss is contained to small areas.    you have to eat breakfast and lunch, buddy, your body needs the fuel and nutrients.|`|7fead720aa4feb08b7448cf2972c9174aa	I think you're probably fine. You probably just didn't notice hair loss when it was short, and now that it's long it's more noticeable. While it's definately not healthy to wait that long to eat, I doubt it's causing you to lose hair. You should see my brushes. It's perfectly normal unless you start seeing bald spots.|`|qBEsARhnaa	Sounds to me that youre just getting bald. Sucks at a young age, suggest you shave your head before every else notice.

Entao eu sempre lavo, ou apenas molho o cabelo para poder pentear, mas minha cabeleireira disse que lavar os cabelos todos os dias era prejudicial para o couro cabeludo, podendo causar ate mesmo fungos.

F3uFCymoaa	Greens! I have brown eyes and wearing greens always makes my eyes stand out more. Purples work well too. I put my youtube channel in my sources and you can check out some of the tutorials I have on it for different color ideas. My personal belief on eyeshadow/makeup---the sky's the limit...why limit yourself to basic browns?!? If you know how to pick colors for your skintone and know how to blend colors, you can wear anything you want! Hope this helps! Check out the makemeovertutorials link on youtube also. She has brown eyes and does lots of cool things with her makeup.|`|FmHgEcfYaa	pink and brown go great together so try light pinks|`|XGw5Up8yaa	The best trick I know is to use a dark smokey blue eyeliner (not like the ones from the 80s - check your local makeup store). Apply it as close to the lashes as possible, leaving the inner ridges of the eye clean. Then use an eyelash curler and several coats of black or black/brown volumizing mascara.|`|hsT3r4pgaa	blue and brown go really well together but really just put on makeup to mach out outfit|`|ef3275bc93a7e288c4fd8a8e843a7b3baa	Purple, blue is actually better to make them pop, but the problem with that is if your makeup isn't just right, you'll look either trashy or like you're from the 80's.  So use a purple eyeliner, a light purple on the lid, a dark purple on the crease and extend the line only a little bit, and a medium pruple a little above the crease.  Put a highlighter on your brow bone and if you want to make your eyes look farther apart, use a little white highlighter on the inner corners of your eyes.|`|AA10171604	I have brown eyes and gold with brown, green, and purple make them look better!|`|DkwgxTtnaa	Shades of pale yellows,pinks,and browns are good choices.  Also, I would line the inside of my lower lid with white eyeliner, it makes your eyes look big and bright|`|xvYR5prNaa	purple, green, orange, gold..  basically warm colors, not black , pink or white|`|Td4oeCOcaa	what you really want is to look natural never look fake. so if you want your eyes to be your main center of attention then you have to use really earthy tones but sometimes it could be brownish. you can always use a shimmer of glitter which would look really good. use peaches,oranges and purples since we are in summer. now if you want a smokey eye then you should always have black,light green,fuchsia and of caurse a pale blue. a really good tip is to put some of your lipstick as eyeshadows but remember keep it real this tip really works. now if your thinking eyeliner then it should always be a black one never brown. now if your young and want to look more of  a sexy,bold but at the same time classy then you could always use alittle bit of mascara but never too much.

M8CqD3TIaa	My parents wouldn't let me wear thongs either (they were really strict). I got so tired of having panty lines when i was wearing cute pants, that i just quit wearing underwear. This may seem awkward, but you don't have to worry about your underwear showing. Besides, thongs are really uncomfortable, when you are allowed to start wearing them, if you choose to, wear g-strings. They are the ones with the really thin strings that go up your bum, and much more comfortable!|`|AA12042083	I'm probably not the right person to answer this but as a parent i do have an opinion. I live in Miami and believe me I have seen girls younger than you wearing thongs and I know they were because it was visible from behind. What were they looking for? be sexy for guys? what kind of guy do u think would take them seriously at that age? 15 is for me a good age, if you are mature enough not to be showing off.|`|3ukUiRdNaa	your parents reall can't tell you what type of underwear to wear.....then again mine still do|`|UCTQX7noaa	To be honest TMI I was 15 when I started.  They just feel normal.  Not like something is bothering you.  (Some do though).    I think you are old enough-I mean...who is going to see it?  And if that is what they are affraid of Thong or not people are going to do what they want to do.|`|wFTFzouIaa	I think your definately old enough to wear thongs thats the age i started wearing them|`|G51N3XFsaa	The honest answer to this questions is either when your parents start buying them for you or when you can buy your own underwear. There is really no age requirement, but its unreasonable for a 11 or 12 year old girl to be wearing thongs, because there aren't many styles of pants that neccessitate a 12 years old to wear a thong (if not also for the sexual association of thongs). I started to wear them in 10th or 11th grade, so I was around your age---and I started to wear them because I had a job and bought my own underwear and clothes. Although I started to wear them because of curiosity, I eventually realized that thongs are useful because you can wear them with tight pants and not have any panty lines showing.|`|4kdLtO9Yaa	Little girls should not wear thongs or anything else too sexy. It happens all the time to me; Im driving down the road and I see a few girls up the road, and I have no idea how old they are, but they look like theyre atleast 17 so I holler when I drive past and I see theyre only 12 or 13 and I feel like a pedophile. Im sure Im not the only person making this mistake either. Little, little girls need to put on some more clothes. Atleast until they grow up a little more. I say 15 is cool for your question but dont make it obvious|`|jhMyX4Gyaa	your parents can't tell you what underwear to wear!|`|5rZZr5Vraa	14. that's when i started wearing thongs. hha in the beginning i would say they are kinda uncomfortable but once you get used to it they are really comfy cant even feel anything up your butt. haha and they look much better when your wearing pants and stuff, not bunchy. i really think your parents should let you i mean your 15! hah|`|AztjFFsZaa	If u want ot wear a thong then for god sakes wear a thong........buy it urself and wear it........ by the way last time i went to the mall i found Baby Thongs so i guessed i answered ur ?|`|fa8d65f7cb89072ed9da02066964317baa	my sister starting wearing her's when she was 14, from the looks of it it's not comfortable, you should only wear them if you don't want a pantie line|`|qaNkIthOaa	why? they're no better.  i think 15/16 is ok to start wearing them though.|`|5455NAUiaa	If you have to have yer parents permission then HELLO you are still acting like a child.

GROUNDED!!!!! be a rebel.|`|1xa2lXUBaa	I was 12 when I started wearing thongs.. not cuz im a hoochie but cuz I didnt want my pany lines showing. It all depends on your parents cuz my mom didnt have a problem with it.  you can always wear them and not say anything.. jus hide it well and theyre so small u can roll em up and stuff em in your bed.|`|Lao1k1Ffaa	I think you should wait til you are like 16 to start wearing them because research says that thongs cause alot of different stuff at a young age.. So just wait a lil longer. And they are more comfy too..|`|DqmKRyO7aa	I don't think 15 is too young to simply wear a thong.  But, if you want to wear one so you can be one of those girls that has their pants so low that the thong is sticking out for the world to see, then forget it.  I wish teenage girls could see how ridiculous that looks.  It's not cute, it's trashy.

AA10323885	Discuss you are growing up, and tell her you don't want harsh makeup, explain that you will buy the mascara yourself (Sorry hun) look for the kind that has then bristles to prevent a clumpy look. The mascara I use just darkens and lengthens without clump, it looks natural and makes your eyes appear more open. This just cost around ($3.50-$4.00) I don't know exactly my Mom buys my makeup (I use Clinique) it's expensive, but works very well, but they have less expensive brands that work very well also.    I know it stinks not being able to wear makeup like most of the other girls, but your Mom is just trying to show you, that your a pretty girl that doesn't need all that stuff on your face.  I am a very attractive girl too, but I still wear eyeliner and mascara (I'm into the dark eyes "punk" makeup) Just try my advice, or you and your Mom can I girls day out before school starts and head to the mall for a makeover with natural tones, where a professional will find all the right colors, then your Mom will see how pretty and natural you can look while wearing makeup. My Mom did that to me two years ago in the Summer before I went into 7th grade. I was allowed to wear makeup then on.    Also tell her you will only use it with her consent. Showing responsibility will make her more likely to say yes in a situation like this. Don't exactly use bribing. Example, do the laundry for 3 days of wearing Mascara until it turns into a routine.    Good Luck :) :) :)|`|h0BQDyR3aa	hmmm.......tell your mother that u will only use it when you ask her permission. Or you can negotiate with her. for example tell her you can set the dinner table or something.|`|5rzuair7aa	You have two choices    1. Use polite diplomacy and bribes  2.

Wait until your skin really needs it. Until then, be one of the few that shows natural beauty, not Avon and Maybelline beauty.    Hope this helps! ;-)|`|rK1gmydWaa	Say if you love me you will bye me some mascara!|`|69c729bbc40865df57b81abf4bbab3caaa	You sound young.

Talvez seu "interesse" por rapazes mais jovens seja um refugio do casamento, quem sabe a idade do seu marido virou um sin?nimo de mesmice e por isso voc acaba imaginando que os rapazes mais jovens s?o especiais em alguma coisa, tipo: divertidos, atraentes, menos responsveis, sei l, sin?nimo de liberdade.   O que tem de melhor nos jovens  a liberdade e as vezes quando casamos nos sentimos meio que presas e reprimimos alguns sentimentos.   Quem sabe um bom papo com seu marido ajude.

DqmKRyO7aa	Yes, it is fine for teens to use.  The only thing you may want to watch out for is if your teen has oily skin.  I tried Bare Escentuals several years ago and found my skin too oily for it.  After a couple of hours, the powder (foundation) looked splotchy on my skin and sort of separated due to my oily skin.  If your teen doesn't have oily skin, I say Bare Escentuals would be a wonderful product for her.  It's very natural looking which I think most parents would want on their teen.|`|xjPEF65Iaa	yes|`|42683a428d1be59e8a61fe1ee2e544c7aa	It would be perfect for teens as well. I am 31 but I have a 16 year old step daughter and I buy it for us both. She loves it and it is especially good for teenage skin since it is more prone to breakouts. It is natural and will not irritate your skin or clog your pores. I have used it for about 2 years and my step daughter has for about a year and we both love it. It covers really well but doesn't look thick or cakey.|`|GkpPAs5Gaa	Yes it would be ok for any age to use, it's one of the best natural looking products out there. I bought some for my niece when she was 15.|`|EhXWa8p0aa	yeah it works pretty good:] && im a teenager so yup !|`|loQh8lR3aa	Ya, I am 13 and almost all of my friends use bare minerals as well, it great no matter what your age.|`|7cd79b1c1086186d5c2ed0dccf693676aa	Ya it's for anyone and it's really good for your face. I used to use it but I stopped buying it because it's really expensive.|`|AA11784927	Bare Minerals is a great product, and very natural looking. I use it, however I tend to get oily as the day goes on so instead of using the Mineral Veil to polish off the look, I use Laura Gellar's finishing powder. It is white in color but goes on natural and keeps the oil under control all day.  The Bare minerals line has wonderful colors in eye shadows, blushes and the mascara is great as well.  Perfect for everyone

8376bdc87fccc5f06632449f618f2e8eaa	A relaxer just relaxs the curl or wave, it doesn't completely eliminate it. So, you do still have to use a flat iron. The puffiness is coming from the humidity in the air or the heat from your head.|`|T7ZtRVTWaa	It'll happen whether you have a straightener/relaxer or use a flat iron. But overall, the chemical relaxer is the better option because it's healthier for your hair. Daily flat ironing is awful on your hair, but chemical straightening is EXPENSIVE.|`|tTnX75Eiaa	hair relaxer is better in terms of smooth, straight hair than the flat iron  but u have to maintain it well otherwise ur hair will start falling.  u have to do hot oil treatment and deep conditioning and lots of mosturisation.  and every time the roots grow u have to re-touch it.  all these requie money.  flat iron might coz poof but its easy to use and less costly.  use hair products for controlling poof like sleek look spray with the flat iron.|`|T6bpjntHaa	this shouldn't happen with a relaxer but depending on what type of hair you have or what state it is in it may damage your hair. maybe a reason why your hair gets poofy is because it needs more moisture. try the product dr. miracle, it works to help your hair. or tre semme's new product that helps your hair keep moisture when you flat iron.|`|rSlC9k6xaa	I say it really depends on the type of hair that you have. I usually use a relaxer retouch to help with new growth. So I wouldn't really recommend a relaxer if your hair grows longer naturally. Because the chemicals can do more harm than good for your hair. I suggest using the flat iron, and possibly looking into a type of holding spray or some type of hair gel or foam or something that holds the straightened look in place and cuts down on the poofiness.|`|21d816fda91a16202b2cba12cfd98f4faa	I agree, find a good product to help keep your hair straight after flat ironing.    The absolute best bar none I have ever used is "S Factor" by TIGI.  They have shampoo, conditioner, deep conditioner, and a line of styling products.  All are great.  I swear by the styling sprays -- the flat iron spray especially.    I have very VERY curly hair and when I use S Factor products, I get stick-straight hair, and it stays that way until I wash it.  Even through high humidity and rain!|`|AA10108338	when you use a flat iron - do you use a gel or mouse?|`|Z2ejWibxaa	you could try it but really depends on your hair texture but you should consult a stylist first.|`|iTOmiv6Daa	flat iron...  you can use straightening sprays with your flat iron to help your poof problem  try herbal essances dangerously straight spray  you spray it on before you straighten when your hair is dry  i use it and it works  [my hair is a little frizzy/poofy too]  and also, it may be poofing if your getting wet or sweating, so make sure thats not happening!  hope i helped!  [:|`|E52xuFjsaa	it depends on you hair texture, because mine do that, i permed it - nothing happend!, see a stylist|`|AA11180892	Depending on your hair type, relaxers may damage your hair.Then you will be left with split ends which will in turn make your hair super frizzy and poofy.Stick to the flat iron.Just buy a product to use that will help during the flat iron process.There are plenty of them out there.They help keep the humidity from frizzing your hair.Most major lines such as nexxus and garnier have one.Just shop around.|`|AA11306005	Using a relaxer will control any frizz or poofing that might occur with flat ironing. The plus side to relaxing as opposed to daily flat ironing is that there's no heat damage. However be sure to think this through before you make the official decision.|`|1cAdhOnNaa	Chemicals are terrible for your hair.  If you use a treatment with chemicals you will probably end having to cut your hair because of damage to the ends. If you think it poofs with a flat iron, wait till you see what happens when it is DRIED OUT!

4bfzjgbzaa	You were born that way. The melanin in your skin isn't distributed evenly.    The gene is related somehow to the genes for red hair; that is, people with really red hair almost invariably have this problem. But there are all colors of red, and some people have this who don't have red hair.     Me, for instance.     Tanning evenly is cool, but there are many ways to be cool. Freckles are cute, and if you ain't got it, you ain't getting it, so consider yourself blessed: you can be cool *and* cute, and many people cannot.|`|tTnX75Eiaa	sometimes the pills' effect takes time to go away.  se a doc to clear that|`|C8uJvtb9aa	its because the melanin in your body (which is what reacts when you expose yourself to the suns rays and "tans" you to protect your body) isnt in one smooth layer all over, but rather broken around. So, the melanin tans but the little spaces around the granules dont, producing freckles.
ianeYzT2aa	Its probably just the sun if your in it to long it can change the color of your.

Psaw4xdIaa	I think adding moisture to a sandy head wouldn't help the problem at all.  I would shake as much out while it is dry, and if it is really bad, maybe try vaccuuming it out with the little nozzle.  Sounds silly, but it'll probably work!|`|64616a1a050d498364f7d4dfcb14718eaa	No... nothing like that that I have ever seen/heard of. I've had the same problem to and I have thick, longish hair. I know childrens' hair texture is different, along with difficult... but there is a solution, one you may have tried-- try harder! ...Just get a good shampoo, can be cheap-- but not too cheap, children's shampoo is fine, and use more than you normally would... lather and scrub... massage the head in every direction, start at the headline and try scrubbing back, all the way to the back of the head. Rinse well. If that doesn't work, try doing it twice. RINSE WELLL! I see no reason why it wouldn't come out then... Good luck! =]

ttcbf6paaa	Hay un tratamiento que es bastante bueno, y yo le he usado personalmente.  Haz una mezcla en tres partes iguales de:  aceite de ricino  aceite de almendras dulces  aceite de oliva, extra virgen para cocinar.  Revuelve la mezcla en un frasco limpio y tibiala a ba?o maria, pontela en el cabello y cuero cabelludo, date un masaje suave, cubrete con una gorra de plastico por unos 15 min. y lavate el cabello normalmente, te recomiendo que hagas abundante espuma, pero usa un shampoo suave para que no reseques el cuero cabelludo, te recomiendo una toalla ligera para que te talles bien el cabello, y secalo con secadora tibia, y cuando ya este casi seco tu cabello dale una pasada con el aire frio, te garantizo resultados.  Ingerir BIOTINA, es tambien excelente, se ve la diferencia en cabello y u?as en un par de semanas.|`|MSeeDbxzaa	mira lo mejor que puedes hacer es aplicarte una mascarilla de aguacate por veinte minutos asi te ira cojiendo brillo y suavidad ... tambien puedes aplicarte mayonesa en las puntas para que no se te abran puntas, y trata de no cojertelo tanto...|`|tnqYsSZ9aa	Puedo sugerirte,que mezclesaaceite de almendras,con una yema de huevo,batirlo hasta lograr una crema homogenea.coloca en largos y puntas,No en el cuero calludo(alli tiene su proteccion natural del sebo)coloca una gorra de ba?o y deja actuar por 1 hora y media.Enjuaga profundamen  tecon abundante agua tibia.un buen champu,para cabellos,maltratados(PANTEN)crema enjuague y por ultimo alguna sabia,o crema que no se retire lo podes repetir cada quince dias.Que te quede bien???????|`|xCnbYUpHaa	aparte de la receta que te dieron de la mezcla de aceites que se que si sirve, tambin te aconsejo una crema de keratase para humectar el pelo lo venden en las estticas profesionales, y el shampoo de garnier de oil repair, te dan suavidad y brillo, procura no usar gel ni spray para que no lo maltrate mas.deja que tu pelo descanse un poco de los tintes procura ponerte el tono mas parecido a tu color natural y le des un tiempo a tu pelo para que sane. espero que te sirva de algo mi consejo. suerte.|`|iHtyawoIaa	esto te va a ayudar mucho.....aguacate machacado con aceite de olivo tivio....te lo pones especialmente en las puntas ..te pones una gorra de plastico o una bolsa de hule te funciona igual.te la dejas por 20 minutos en un lugar donde te de calor ,,,,o te pones bajo el sol por unos 15 minutos de preferencia a medio dia te enjuagas con agua tibia y te pones un tratamiento sin enjuagar puede ser sedal o garnier fructis lo encuentras en las tiendas de auto servicio|`|tTcPjRXZaa	deverias realizarte un ba?o de crema cada 15 dias eso te lo va a mejorar, logico q deves ser constante en  hacerte este tipo de tratamientos ya sea con un producto q ya este preparado o sea casero, porq si no, a tu pelo no le va a hacer efecto, y ademas deverias dejar de hacerte tantas tinturas y decoloraciones, al menos por un tiempo, hasta q tu cabello se mejore........suerte y saludos|`|aeacf0c2411ee31b0277dbadbe03df9daa	Prueba con este tratamiento natural y econmico para que el cabello te quede brilloso y con vida aplica aceite de coco y miel, si el pelo est muy castigado, a?ade una yema de huevo.

vaehodK3aa	just cut your hair..it doesnt need to be long and you can start anew|`|gsBkLXUzaa	First, treat your lice!     Then, I would use a diluted shampoo only and make sure you use a heavy conditioner (try Herbal Essence straightening one -- trust me on this!) and then put a serum in the ends.|`|WRNCfhn2aa	u can try to use head and shoulder or dove and u should wash it at less once every two day|`|11uRzs7iaa	No worries hun calm down!!!!!!!!!! A huge mistake people make when shopping for shampoo and conditioneer is they see the WORD shampoo or conditioneer and grab it and run!!!! EVERY SINGLE ONE has a different purpose. Try to look for one made specially for dry and damaged hair. Your hair is most likely acting up because of the materials used from you lice products. Always remember though that you are gorgeous and your body will always find a way to make you beautiful : )!!!!|`|fZGBjtpVaa	Fructis is crap shampoo it makes my hair all dry and straw-like.  The best shampoo I've found to use is V05.   It's excellent and it really gives your hair volume, are you using medicated products to get rid of the lice?  If so that's another cause, try leaving alot of conditioner in your hair and then comb it through with a nitcomb, when you've finished rinse it out NEVER leave it in.    Also if you wash your hair too much it damages it, try and wash it every 2-3 days then your hair won't lose its natural oils.  If you wash your hair too often you become used to it, so once you  miss a day it becomes really greasy.  The absolute best thing I've done is not washed my hair for about a week so it washed itself and regained all its oils, (of course I shampoo after that).  Not alot of people do that as, well let's face it it's not nice to have greasy hair for a week.  Anyway I hope this helps.|`|vjFVgP8maa	A) If you have lice you should use a lice shampoo to get rid of it or go to someplace like Hair Fairies.  B) There is probably a Garnier Fructis for dry hair.  C) Go to a hairdresser and get it cut or at least ask them whats going on.|`|KkS5CUavaa	Well first of all, there are special shampoos and combs to help get rid of Lice.  You should really consider getting these before you spread the Lice to somebody else.  You can get it at any Drugstore/Pharmacy.  It may also help to rid the Lice and make your hair less dry if you wash your hair everyday, it only takes a few minutes so it is worth the outcome and it will not damage your hair more.  Hope this helps!|`|sIyWzKGIaa	you MUST  get rid of the lice.. have someone help you..I went through this once it sucked..  Get this stuff called RID it kills the lice and you shampoo with it several times then you should go outside and have some one help you pick every lice egg out of your hair.. this should take several days. In the process...get some mayonaise and massage it through alll of your hair and let it sit there for about 15-20 minutes (no Bull sh*t.! I know it sounds gross) but its good to get rid of the lice and it makes your hair reallly smooth. Make sure you take all your sheets and pillow cases and wash them...|`|89d6101549ecc9b5f5ce57be839952b3aa	First you have to make sure that you have no lice by using medication for it as I'm sure your aware. Secondly you should be washing your hair more than that in my opinion. The medication could have dried out your hair but washing your hair isn't 100% about "getting the grease out". If you washed and conditioned your hair more often it would get more nutrients and proteins, not to mention protect your hair from sun damage during the summer.It could be just the way your hair is as well, either way washing and conditioning at least 3 times a week would help the long term health of your hair and scalp. Along with this you could try a leave in conditioner to build your hair's strength up and switch from ganier fructis for normal hair to volumizing shampoo and conditioner. I use aussie volumizing shampoo and intense conditioner because my hair is flat and tends to be dry without it.|`|c365c431fdf210c0ba4faa6f235c9486aa	ok first of all, if you have lice tell your parents or doctor because it spreads fast! second, try a new shampoo that advertises mousturizers in it, like Suave. and try washing your hair every other day, because studies show when you get over age 10, your body produces more oils, which means you might need to hop in the shower more often then you think.              hope this helps! good luck!|`|7b7e4828c62bd672238ce491a2d8bf05aa	ok well stop using the shampoo u use now if u have lice get a lice removing shampoo and once all the lice are out then u should get an extra moisturizing shampoo and conditioner and just for more help get head and shoulders dandruf shampoo just so you can get ur hair with all the moisture and help it can get

Other body parts are just as smelly, if not smellier and those are sometimes shown by men.  Other body parts are also very prone to blisters.

iJbPkBEVaa	Para mi lo mas importante no es el final sino el principio de las cosas, te explico:    Lo mas importante esque hidrates bien la piel, antes de que te pongas nada, para ello usa una crema hidratante especifica para tu piel (seca, grasa, mixta)    Luego otra parte importante son los correctores (liquidos, mouse, barritas...)  Con esto conseguiras "disimulas" las imperfeciones como ojeras, manchitas, granitos...     Luego el tipo de maquillaje es muyyyyyy extenso, tb depende del tipo de piel, lo qe mas te interesa es q sea para tu piel.  El formato en que viene el maquillaje (liquido, en polvos, mouse) es simplemente para el efecto que lo quieras (el mouse te deja la piel mas aterciopelada, los polvos bajo mi punto de vista son los mas suaves y naturales pero tienes que tener la piel muy bonita para poder usarlos, y el liquido es facil de poner y suele durar bastante)  Tambien decirte q es muy importante q eligas el color q mas se parezca a tu tono natural de piel,para que se funda con mayor naturalidad.    Luego tampoco olvidarse del colorete q es muy importante para darle luz a la expresion.    Espero haberte ayudado un poquito y recordarte q lo mas importante del maquillaje es que sea natural y que sea como tu color de piel.|`|OP2EslOXaa	Me gusta mas la base, se ve mas natural.-|`|d481ba6310d4d69c5f43d482f87e340aaa	Los dos....aprendi de fuentes muy buenas.....(fotografos de modelos) que mezclar los dos maquillajes es lo mejor par una cara hermosa.   Primero por supuesto la base ( cremosa ) y enseguida el polvo.   Porque ellos saben y han comprobado que para verse mejor una modelo necesita llevar los dos. Y ese consejo te lo paso gratis.   Todas queremos vernos mejor....verdad?|`|c8c30a6511c4a70ccdee041d4a8915b6aa	Eso va en funcin del cutis que tengas, para una piel grasa son mejores los polvos, y para las demas, la base, siempre hay que aplicar un fondo de maquillaje, y crema hidratante, para cuidar la piel. Aunque de todas formas hay ambos tipos de maquillaje para todos los tipos de piel, elige el que ms te guste y ms comodo te parezca a la hora de aplicarlo, tambin es verdad que a unas pieles les queda mejor uno u otro.|`|Jy25ZlmIaa	base es mejor, ya que los polvos te resecan mucho la piel        BESOS!|`|J9IAale8aa	Yo te recomendaria la base, pero no la uses en exeso, ya que con el tiempo va da?ando tu rostro|`|B7RYXX62aa	Lo mejor es q lo combines, primero aplica una crema humectante o un potenciador de maquillaje, deja pasar un par de minutos para que lo absorva la piel, luego aplica la base q sea acorde a tu tono de piel, luego aplica el corrector de ojeras (si lo necesitas) y luego los polvos traslcidos, el maquillaje se vera mejor y durar mas  saludos|`|FlkdiLRWaa	Hola Daniela, yo soy partidaria de usar base, ya q la base se adhiere mejor a nuestra piel y nos protege de las inclemencias del medio ambiente, mucho mas si esta contiene protector solar y es hidratante... eso si, es importante q nuestra base sea de cobertura ligera, q no obstruya los poros y si es libre de fragancia, mucho mejor...|`|6l92L89Aaa	Hola amiga! No dices tu edad pero seguro que estas alrededor de los veinte... en nuestro caso, depende! Ya te explico mejor.    La base es recomendada para mujeres con edad mayor o personas que trabajan bajo luces fuertes, como los trabajos en television o fotografia... ya que la base cubre mejor las imperfecciones y si se tiene arrugas te las disimula mejor.  Pero la base es algo fuerte para utilizarla diariamente, lo que nos trae a nuestro caso.    Por nuestra edad, nuestra piel aun es muy joven y no necesita mas soporte que el polvo, el polvo es super recomendable, facil de usar, luce natural siempre y cuando compres tu color, y es economico!      Te recomiendo utilizar solo un poco de base, si vas a tomarte fotografias o si vas a una fiesta de noche que requiera un poco mas de maquillaje.. Pero para el dia a dia.. el polvo es excelente y no necesitaras mas que usarlo a el!    Mucha suerte :)|`|c5ad3244db0a9dfbefa026feedaf440caa	Eso depende del tipo de piel de cada uno.

GNTwr5Pjaa	You could do french braided pigtails or put in back in a headband to keep it out of your face. You should keep your make-up fairly natural since you are going to be outdoors, so maybe just your basic foundation, mascara, sheer lip gloss and a little blush and you should be all set!|`|9PosSz5Qaa	put it in a pony tail w/ a poof! and just do ur makeup how u usually do it.|`|w98srjRnaa	her hair is pretty....i would leave it down|`|8pw8qDjPaa	you're going to get sweaty, and messy. why would you even bother doing hair and makeup? <br>  <br>  put on some mascara and go with it.|`|N7mIENr2aa	i would do light make up for skiing, concealer, eyeliner and a lip-gloss that also protects against the sun. For your hair i would wash it blow dry straighten and then put it in a low side pony tail( if you have bangs clip them up) and put some hair spray so it hold and voila!

cHhSCgXLaa	since ur going for a sporty look try glamming it up a bit. mix it around, go unique. like for example, try a funky flat. metalic? animal print? if u dont have any of them, try boots. hair styles, id say leave it down and side part it. then do loose waves with a curling iron. and how u do them is u wrap ur hair in the curling iron and keep letting go of the barrel until u reach the ends of ur hair. it will be gorgeous. if the sweat shirt is high necked, dont wear any necklaces. but try wearing cute diamond studs. hope i helped!|`|wIpkGuRhaa	do NOT wear necklaces with a hoodie it will look sooo dumb this girl i know wears heels w basketball shorts and it looks ridiculous bc its tryin to dress up something that isnt made to be dressy u want to be comfortable but cute so by putting up hair in a ponytail and putting a ribbon in it will give you a cute look that alot of cheerleaders do uggs would also look cute or you can try layering tanks under your hoodie and it will give extra color to your outfit|`|ntTT8vUIaa	Try a braid in one part of your hair but only about a 1 inch section. Then tie it with a clear or hair-colored scrunchie. Then pull it back with the rest of your hair into a pony-tail. Here's an example:<br>  <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wmaYDsHuOQI/SKSjdEko9zI/AAAAAAAACNA/7MK66NRiruk/s400/86300_lauren-conrad-flying-06_122_556lo.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wmaYDsHuOQI/SK...</a><br>  <br>  Then, for shoes wear some that are colorful, but still keep in mind the color of the sweatshirt and be sure they "go."|`|ScjTCJqWaa	If your allowed to (I'm assuming this is for school) you should pick out a really cute corsage, or get some funky pins. you can also get pretty hair bands with bows and cupcakes and necklaces too with them on :D It's cold at the mo (well in England it is) so a nice scarf could look good! Shana logic is a good site, but it's american. (I don't know if you are?) Hope this helps|`|XC2GJUf3aa	i think converse shoes would be ok with it. You could leave your hair down straight or scrunch if it works for you. Even a pony-tail might work because its casual. The sweatshirt will probably hide any necklaces, so maybe a cool bracelet or ring? <br>  Hope that helps.|`|fENRo4eQaa	put your hair up in a bun, wear a longer tank top under the sweatshirt to made a layered effect, maybe a blue necklace and a cute bracelet. you should try putting bobby pins in your hair to look really cute....<br>  <br>  hope this helps...( buy converse.)|`|czBiPIVBaa	uggs|`|QPbgZ0EPaa	converse? and idk about the hair...umm idk i gues since ur outfit is dark, mayb a necklace or sumthing w/bright color?|`|JQZzI49Paa	put rips in them|`|O7xYvttsaa	dont wear neckalces with a hoodie and put your hair up in a ponytail. isnt the point of wearing a hoodie being comfortable?? as for shoes, wear pumas or something like that.|`|IHwMbLX5aa	You dont want to dress it up too much because that would look stupid. Maybe some simple cute earrings... or cute flat shoes (don't do heels with a grey sweatshirt... looks like you are trying to hard). Just do your makeup and hair nice too... little you can do accessory wise!|`|asGVrqhEaa	try gold or dark purple, purple will make the sweatshirt POP! Even red will look good! Try flats in whatever color I just told you, Try not to mix and match, purple and gold would look good if you like that!|`|BXfHhsXqaa	If you're going to wear your Uggs, wear some necklaces, and a messy French twist with a headband.|`|B7Th5KMeaa	sneakers(new balance preferably)<br>  low ponytail<br>  studs|`|X2BMymt8aa	You should brush your hair back into a fairly high ponytail and before you tie it up make it really loose and don't tie the hair elastic too close to you're head. This gives a really nice look, especially on blonde hair.<br>  To accessorize your outfit, wear simple bangles and bracelets and a really nice watch (on different arms) and maybe wear some medium sized, hoop earrings. <br>  Put on some nice make-up like brown colors and vanilla shades for the more natural look and there you have it! A wonderful outfit!! :)|`|HinSwo97aa	get a long necklace, black maybe? or bright colors<br>  plenty of bracelets<br>  one or two rings<br>  and for your hair<br>  i'd take a shower, wash it<br>  then braid it into 5 separate braids<br>  hairspray, sleep on it<br>  wake up, take out braids<br>  hairspray.<br>  it looks amazing.<br>  and shoes, i'd wear boots / uggs<br>  or colorful flats.<br>  definately accesorize!|`|GkXCl7JHaa	when i wear a sweatshirt and jeans, i wear a long necklace that's noticable.

2fHWcAdFaa	hmm... if you have the technique down, then all you need is to change products... i LOVVVEE blast from joico for teasing on fine hair. that shi t wont move for DAYYYYSSS... try half blast before you sign on for blast. its not as crunchy, but delivers quite a bit of hold still. spray lightly before teasing, then tease it up and spray a few coats on. when you get the height you want... ICE it with hairspray... then smooth it so it looks half decent and you should have big sexy instyle hair thats teased...then you can ice it a final time then plan on it lasting all night, maybe even a few days....happy hairstyling!|`|sO8fjj9faa	hairspray and a teasing comb..watch a YOU TUBE VIDEO ON SCENE HAIR AS WELL IF U NEED HELP.|`|oVT98RSfaa	take the top layer of ur hair and put it up out of the way, then hold the hair while brushing upwards, then spray spray spray, then release the top layer and str8n it!!1   :P|`|Ljo6y6J6aa	It really depends on different type of hair texture.  Some girls are lucky, some just have silky hair.    If you want perfect hair tease, cut your hair in chops.  Try that, and continue teasing your hair. If your hair is soft and silky, then spray it with a thickner or light hairspray. blow dry it and begin to tease. you can possibly be teasing it the wrong way also. but i highly doubt that you are. anyways, make sure you spray your hair with a good hairspray. this will do a big part in helping it stay put.|`|R5z2cJIRaa	well to start off, get a bunch of layers if you dont.  maybe that is why?    get a teasing comb and tease it.  then use bedhead hair spray and spray it in place.  o & straighten it.  it HAS to be straighted to tease it.    :)|`|mPqgfEhNaa	yea! jules is right!|`|V9VemAoDaa	teasing is not in syle so don't bother.|`|hnItHP6yaa	Get one of the brushes with the black brissles.  Then take some hair, hold it angled up, and brush backward, like towards the root instead of towards the end.  Don't worry about messing up the top.  Keep doing this until you get the desired height then lay back the hair.  Take a comb and comb the top of the hair so its pretty and smoothed out!   Hope that helped a little!|`|GR30bvH9aa	teasing in really easy to do, i tease my hair everyday it will look like you have alot of volume and not the 80's tease that everyone thinks of.    just take small sections starting at the very top of your head, hold the section up and then kinda like your brushing your hair backwards, use a comb... do the whole top of your head, then spray and take a fine bristle comb or brush and smooth it out

cHhSCgXLaa	it would help if u gave us ur skin tone, and your face shape. also, if u have curly or straight hair. my hair is curly/ wavy. if u have an oval face, u want something that accentuates your cheek bones. for example, short short very noticable layers. they bring out ur cheek bones dramatically. if u have a circular face, then i would definately go for a blunt bang. if u dont want to do that try a side bang. its very cute and managable and doesnt make ur face look so round. if u have a square face, then cut it short into an angled bob. if thats too much for u, then just make sure  u keep it short, but keep an angle to your hair. because if u have a square face than u dont want a square cut. if u have a heart or diamond shape face, definately grow it out. it will defiantely highlight ur gorgeous pointy chin. :] hope i helped!!!|`|xgziZhNOaa	it all depends on what u think would look gd.

DhPMkORnaa	The best thing you can say when people confront you like that is something along the lines of "I suppose." That way you're neither owning up to being emo or denying it. And when they ask you half a second later "What's that supposed to mean?" simply tell them "Well, this is just how I am." If they question you further (which they probably won't do because they can't really call you out on anything), just explain yourself. Tell them everything you wrote in your first paragraph. But seeing as how they're idiots, they'll most likely lose interest halfway through your explanation and will bug stop bugging you because you have a legit reason for why you are the way you are.<br>  <br>  And not that I need to say it, but people like that are useless. Don't let them get you down; you're obviously too intelligent for them.|`|HqaAQ8lYaa	Just be like "yea, you got a problem with it?" <br>  People say things like that to me too, but I say something like that and they let it be.

CadIYXdXaa	Brush out your hair after a shower, for long hair brush it all over one shoulder and apply mousse (Alberto has an EXCELLENT mousse/gel 2in1) brush in, bush hair to the other shoulder and repeat. Brush hair back into the style you want. Spray with a flexible hold hairspray. Use your hands to "scrunch" your hair a bit (hair hanging to the side use ur hands to "push it" up from the ends up to your scalp).

ABOvm38Caa	I would definitely do a spray tan.  They might not last as long, but they are not as damaging to your skin as a  tanning bed would be.  You might not appreciate it now, but you will regret it when you get older.  There are so many tanning sprays and lotions out there that really make your skin glow and stay moisturized.  And I would definitely think that at your age you would need a parent's consent if you really want to do a tanning bed because of the risks of tanning.|`|AA10451868	Yes. I am starting tonight again. I payed 220.00 for a point system. This comes with special lotion. You need eye protection , "winkies" , lotion accelerator. Tan naked so you do not have any tan lines come summer.|`|1Qz0cZ2Waa	Yes you need your parent(s)<br>  <br>  Best way to tan for you is self tanner try Loreal it costs about $8<br>  <br>  The price depends on the package you want<br>  <br>  You need tanning lotion <br>  <br>  Really though~ either get spray tan or self tanner at the pharmacy, you don't need a parent for that.
FKQvRZhXaa	when  you reach the full 20 minutes and have gone a few times then i would do stand up. If it is a good salon the stand up will have higher level bulbs and be able to get you a better more even tan, but like you said you need a base tan before you can build onto that. However, if you want to go ahead and try it there really is not reason why you shouldnt its not gonna hurt!|`|1Qz0cZ2Waa	I wouldn't worry about going for the stand up beds... I don't think they tan you as well & they aren't as relaxing. Yes you do wear goggles in the stand ups.|`|Opz3o8Boaa	No tam. Pale is the new tan.

VN2wyTnFaa	The oils in your skin start to break down the makeup during the day and also the makeup starts to wear off. You can slow that process by wearing primers underneath your makeup to create a barrier between your skin and your makeup. Hope that helped, good luck!|`|Vm2ywW5Caa	You should try wearing a base underneath your eyeliner. Either a primer that you specifically buy for that, or you can use your foundation. Also, try to get waterproof makeup when you can. Revlon color stay is amazing eyeliner. My eyeliner always looks the same at night as when I first put it on. It's kind of hard to get off, but that's the point! That's when you know it really works to stay on.|`|YaFKI2lxaa	I think because the oil that your skin produces?|`|kKPT2VCfaa	The oils in your skin are present ^_^ :P

You separate your hair into three parts, you take one of the outsides and put it in between the middle and other side, then the middle will take its place. Take the other side and put it in between the middle and other side. Keep switching sides if that helps. Also follow this link and maybe it will help.

Mas busque por produtos ricos em queratina e da fa?a a hidrata??o certinho que da certo sim, pois seu cabelo precisa ser restaurado. N?o invente mais que o cabelereiro indicou, salvo por alimentos naturais. Dieta ricas em vitaminas tmb ajudam, lembrando que os cabelos fazem parte do corpo e assim o que se insere atinge todo o organismo. Ex. Eu adoro hidratar os cabelos com cenoura. Bato no liquidificador, escorro o caldinho atraves de um pano, misturando-o no creme hidratante. Fa?o passagem com os dedos no couro cabeludo para abrir os poros para receber a hidrata??o. nao dormo com os cabeos molhados para nao aprodrecer a raiz e assim meu cabelo melhorou muito.

Vc tem q tomar muito cuidado, precisa ver qual  a base do produto q foi usada, tipo quarnidina, formol, amonia entre outros que existem . Talvez vcs estivesse com um produto em seu cabelo d quimicas anteriores que naum fosse compativel com essa que usou. Cabelo descolorido  muito sensivel naum se deve usar amonia entre outros prq ocorre a quebra. E vc tem q ver se seu cabelo est caindo ou quebrando.... se estiver quebrando o melho r tratamento  hidrata??o(mas concerteza  quebra), ja no caso d quebra pode ser problema com hormonios, depress?o, tens?o, ai vc precisa de ajuda medica. Mas no seu caso deve ser do produto mesmo.  Cuida bm desse cabelo hidrata bem ele.  E sempre que for usar esses tipos de produtos procure um profissional experiente e confiavel.

Don't go buy the kind at Walmart, invest in a good hair care product that will in the long run save you money. My mom uses a colour preserve conditioner, and it makes a HUGE difference.

5RoYyprkaa	Anything that's green or yellow that's coming out of a piercing is not good. It's probably infected. I've seen several infected eyebrow piercings, mostly because of the location, the sweat and oils that drip down into it. Anyway, go back to the person who pierced you. Let them look at it, and tell you what to do. You might have to remove it, but let the piercer remove it for you. Until then, just keep it as clean as you can.|`|iTKSJwRPaa	No need for a doctor here. I recommend going back/calling to your piercer and asking them what to do. They've probably had someone with your infection before, and know exactly what to do. Are you cleaning your piercing? If you haven't been thats probably why it has gotten infected.|`|tfjSUfQfaa	yeah i agree with the person above me<br>  also it is pretty hard to tell without getting a look at it but ive had piercings and none of them have ever gone green/yellow<br>  so your best bet would to be get it looked at<br>  better to be safe than sorry!
znngp3E0aa	You use three tablespoons of sea salt per one gallon of distilled water. I got my belly button pierced a week and a half ago and it's seemed to work for me just fine. :D|`|iTKSJwRPaa	You're talking about a Sea Salt Soak. You mix 1/4 tsp of UN-IODIZED sea salt with a cup of hot water. Dunk 2 cotton balls into the mixture and hold it on the piercing on both sides for 5-10 mins twice a day. You don't have to do this though, you could buy H2Ocean from Hot Topic. It's basically the same as a Sea Salt Soak, except Sea Salt Soaks are waaaaay cheaper. So you could buy un-iodized sea salt at Wal-Mart for 3 dollars or spend like, 6 dollars on H2Ocean. Both are perfectly fine, and neither is better than the other :)|`|5RoYyprkaa	You don't have to mix anything with sea salt, other than water, to clean your piercing. Lots of shops sell H2Ocean spray, which is salt water in a can. It's easy to use and you don't use more than you need.<br>  <br>  I used salt water for all my piercings, and they all healed fine.|`|24sK6L2uaa	You don't use table salt you use sea salt with warm water. Its 1/4 teaspoon for every 8 ounces of warm water. Saline solution is the sea salt solution btw. The big difference between making the solution and home and the H2O spray is the warm water. The spray is good in a pinch but the warm water helps with the cleaning also.|`|1T1rHTGBaa	mine hurt for a few weeks esp when it caught on my jeans!! <br>  I just used antibacterial soap while in shower and i used regular salt and warm water every now n then. I mixed the salt in warm water in a shot glass and laid down and let it sit over it for a minute then moved the belly ring around to let it get in|`|Qb4P6ruEaa	I got mine pierced a few months back too (:<br>  Anyway, its gonna hurt for a little bit, don't freak out.<br>  & you mix water with the sea salt. But i recommend you go to hot topic and buy their piercing after-care spary. Its reeeally good.<br>  Good luck (:|`|NHcGhnEuaa	I just got my navel pierced in January. <br>  I'd recommend that you use Saline Wound Wash. You can find it at stores like CVS, Walgreen's, Rite Aid, etc. <br>  That's what I've been using since I've had mine done and it's fine. <br>  Your piercing will also be sore for a while, probably for at least the first two weeks. Just keep it clean and you'll be fine. <br>  Redness and a little bit of puss is normal as well. <br>  The white puss that will begin to come out as it heals is just the white blood cells in your body fighting off infection. So no worries!|`|GPI54V76aa	Heres what my piercer told me: "ONLY use saline solution on a q-tip. Clean it three times a day." It has worked for me.<br>  :)<br>  He said if you wouldn't eat it or put it in your eye, don't use it on your piercing.

IVnjNpmOaa	Voc tem que fazer assim pra come?ar:  - mudar seu jeito de pensar  - ingerir muita agua [mais de 2L por dia]  - aumentar o consumo de frutas verduras e legumes  - esquecer os doces, frituras, gorduras, carne vermelha, refrigerantes, etc...  - praticar exercicio fisico mais de 4 x por semana  - lembrar o tempo todo do que vc quer pra n?o desistir no primeiro tombo    Depois disso vc deve ter em mente:    - comer a cada 3 horas [3 refei?oes principais - caf, almo?o e jantar; e 3 lanchinhos - da manha, da tarde e a ceia]    - nas refei?oes principais vc deve se preocupar em  fazer com que nelas tenham dos 3 principais grupos de alimentos [carboidrato, proteina e reguladores]    Vou dar um exemplo:    caf da manh?:  - Banana amassada com aveia  - 1 copo de leite desnatado com 1 col. de achocolatado ou 1 copo de leite de soja    lanche:  - 1 fruta [ma??, pera, 1 fatia de melao..]    almo?o:  [inicie pela salada]  - salada de verduras [alface, tomate, rucula, agriao, couve...]  - salada de legumes [ cenoura, beterrada, abobrinha, chuchu...]  - 1 file pequeno de carne magra [frango ou peixe]  - 2 col. [sopa] de arroz integral  - 1 concha de feijao    de sobremesa gelatina ou uma fruta    lanche:  - 2 torradas   - 1 copo de suco natural ou 1 fruta    jantar  fa?a como o almo?o, mas se puder tire o arroz e o feij?o e diminua as quantidades    ceia  - 1 copo de leite com 1 col. de achocolatado    Se vc seguir esse esquema e praticar exercicios, vai perder seus 10 quilos em no mximo 4 meses.   N?o se anime com dietas milagrosas que prometem muitos quilos a menos em pouco tempo, porque quando vc parar de faz-la, vc engorda o dobro.

O que vc precisa fazer  uma reeduca??o alimentar.    Pegue um caderno e fa?a um dirio do que vc comeu por uma semana. Coloque tudo, mesmo as coisas que vc apenas beliscou. Seja honesta.    Depois disso fa?a uma anlise de onde vc est cometendo os erros (n?o h mgica, s engorda quem come errado - se a pessoa n?o tiver nenhuma doen?a). Ser que por exemplo vc n?o est ingerindo a?car demais?    J que vc quer perder muitos kilos inicialmente vai ter que cortar alguns alimentos radicalmente. Depois que chegar no peso ideal, pode voltar a ingeri-los moderadamente.    Fa?a pelo menos 5 refei??es dirias (ficar com est?mago vazio por muitas horas n?o emagrece, j que o metabolismo fica lento).    Fa?a uma atividade fsica (qualquer uma, caminhada, andar de escada, evitar o carro ou o ?nibus para percorrer pequenas distancias, pular corda, etc.)    Cardpio    Ao acordar    Tome um copo de gua (de preferncia morna) - vai ajudar a desintoxicar seu organismo e funcionar melhor seu intestino.

Beba no minimo 02 litros de agua diarios.  O ch verde d sensa??o de saciedade. N?o sei porque, sei que me sinto assim, talvez pela enorme de quantidade de liquido ingerido.  Caminhe pelo menos  03 vezes na semana.    Com 20 dias voce ter emagrecido 5 kgs   Esta fora da pergunta, mas para complementar o seu ritual de SAUDE e beleza, passe creme (aquele da avon  bom) ANTI CELULITE na barriga e massagei bem.  Fa?a auto massagem, tem muito na net procure no google.  Me conta o resultado depois.
NiQ4sd7Vaa	Mari, n?o seja boba. Se no primeiro problema que vcs tiveram no relacionamento ele te traiu,  bvio que ele n?o  uma boa pessoa para vc. Sem querer piorar a situa??o, mas vamos ser francas: ser que foi a primeira vez que isso aconteceu? Ele nem mesmo teve a descncia de admitir oq fez. E n?o tem essa de perdoar. A primeira vez  a mais difcil de se fazer. Quem trai uma trai duas, trs, quatro, cinco, seis vezes sem dificuldade. Eu nunca fui trada, mas se fosse, n?o perdoaria por nada nesse mundo. Trai??o  trai??o,  uma quest?o de confian?a mesmo.   Boa sorte e sai dessa! N?o esquenta a cabe?a. O tempo  o remdio de tudo.

Isso provavelmente  a parte mais difcil, pois a trai??o sempre deixa as marcas da inseguran?a na pessoa que foi trada.   E seu namorado, alm de dizer que n?o traiu voc, diz o que mais? O que mais vocsconversaram e resolveram sobre o namoro, uma vez que voc ainda  menor de idade?  Relacionamentos nem sempre s?o fceis e na sua idade, talvez ainda haja bastante imaturidade para encarar as dificuldades e conseguir buscar solu??es. Pense nisso!!!|`|Ot6asDmHaa	Siga sua razao poi o cora??o  humano e erra  se ele nega a situa?ao e fez  pq esta mentindo.certo?

No entanto se voc tem CERTEZA ABSOLUTA que foi trada, antes de pensar em qualquer coisa, veja quais foram os fatos que o levaram a trair, e o porqu dele ter feito isso.    E s ENT?O, e, SE ele for realmente culpado, termine para que n?o sofra mais, pois quando voc ficar mais velha entenders que nunca precisou fazer essa pergunta e se for voltar para ele, agora voc vai ter uma no??o melhor da vida.

Par ce comportement elle met en place une raction face  la privation : ds qu'elle avale qq chose, le corps le stocke en prvision du manque.    Et puis, autre problme beaucoup plus grave, si les rsultats escompts ne sont pas  la hauteur de ses esprances elle va diminuer les rations progressivement pour tenter de maigrir plus encore : chemin dangereux pouvant conduire  l'anorexie, dont il est difficile de sortir ! Parfois mme impossible !|`|C33LJSFYaa	Le fait de ne manger qu'une fois par jour n'est la solution, au contraire, le corps va stocker le peu de nourriture qu'il a re?u, et le garder..... il vaudrait mieux voir une ditticienne qui fera des menus correspondants a son objectif, faire du sport aidera galement beaucoup. Et combien de poids elle voudrait perdre, parce que se fixer des objectifs hors d'atteinte n'est pas non plus bon pour le moral. Se dire que perdre 1 ou 2 kg par mois est tout a fait valorisant|`|vkIGATR7aa	Quelle age a-t-elle?  Dis lui d'arreter de sauter des repas, de manger quilibr et de manire rgulires mais pas d'excs, pas de grignottages (je pense qu'elle y arrivera vu les sacrifices qu'elle fait actuellement)  Faites galement un peu de sport ensemble : tennis, badbinton, volley, ... de manire  vous dpenser et dis lui d'arreter son "rgime"! Cela ne fait qu'habituer son corps au manque de nourriture et il stocke au maximum les graisses lorsqu'elle mange car il sait qu'il va y avoir privation, c'est une trs mauvaise mthode qu'elle a choisi.  Bon courage  elle et continue de la soutenir sans la laisser faire de btise! :)|`|cd4QcBTyaa	elle doit faire une activit physique (mme faire le mnage tous les jours) et manger des lgumes|`|20a8b02432023b7175848f70bc9e7e0eaa	Elle est idiote, ta copine, pardon de te le dire. Ce qu'elle fait est TRES mauvais. Ds qu'elle remangera normalement, elle prendra encore plus de poids qu'avant.  Ce qu'il fallait faire, pour maigrir, c'est adopter de bonnes habitudes alimentaires (manger de tout mais sans excs, viter les choses sucres qui sont pires que les choses grasses pour le poids, privilgier la viande blanche et le poisson, viter de manger viande et fromage  un meme repas, manger des lgumes et des fruits, ne pas ajouter trop de graisse pour la cuisson, ne pas grignoter entre les repas, manger lger le soir car c'est  ce moment l que l'on stock le plus, boire au minimum 1,5 litres d'eau par jour, etc...), et faire du sport !

Premire chose. Parce que ds qu'elle va recommencer  manger normalement elle va tout reprendre et je ne suis pas s?re que ?a soit le but. De plus, ce n'est pas bon pour l'organisme.    Ensuite, ?a m'embte de lire qu'elle n'a pas besoin de maigrir. Le poids, c'est aussi beaucoup dans la tte. D'un point de vue extrieur, je suis dsole mais 1m65 et 61 kgs, pour moi ?a fait qq. rondeurs. Je ne pense pas que ta copine soit grosse mais si elle ne se sent pas bien dans son corps et dans sa tte alors elle doit faire ce rgime. A mon avis, si elle ne mange plus qu'une fois pas jour c'est qu'elle n'est vraiment pas bien dans sa peau.  Par contre, je lui conseille d'aller voir une ditticienne qui lui conseillera des menus adapts  son poids et  ses habitudes.  Il ne faut pas ne plus rien manger et se priver de toutes les bonnes choses. Un rgime ce n'est pas ?a. Donc il faut qu'elle prenne 3 repas par jour quilibr, avec de la viande et du poisson (pour ne pas perdre de masse musculaire), et beaucoup de lgumes ( volont mme quand ils sont sans graisses). Aprs il faut manger des fculents, mais sans pain. Eviter la cuisson des viandes avec la graisse. Prfrer plut?t la cuisson au grill.  Attention, il ne faut pas supprimer toutes les graisses parce qu'elles sont quand mme ncessaire  notre organisme.  Il faut boire beaucoup d'eau, et de th (si elle aime) mais sans sucre.  Tout cela sera mieux dtaill par une professionnelle. Si elle suit bien tout ?a, elle n'aura pas de problme  perdre ses kilos. Perso, y'a un an que j'ai fais un rgime comme celui-l. Je fesais 1m72 pour 70 kilos et je n'tais pas bien dans ma peau. Je suis tombe  62 en peu de mois, en ne me privant pas plus que ?a. J'ai juste mang mieux qu'avant. Et aujourd'hui je me sens bien dans mon corps, mes kilos ne me pourrisent plus l vie.    Bon courage  elle !|`|X0w3bQtiaa	Pendant le temps ou elle fait un repas par jour , il faut qu'elle profite de ?a pour faire du sport .     Il n' ya pas 50 solutions , et la plus efficace est de combiner limitation alimentaire et sport .     Donc , que ce soit "jogger" , meme doucement , que ce soit la marche (longue dure , plusieures heures) ,  ou bien tous les jeux de balles (tennis seule contre un mur par ex) ,  basket , foot etc ..     Sinon faire de la corde  sauter , c'est un exercice trs efficace et pas trop rbarbatif .  Je te propose aussi d'investire dans un sac de frappe !  Celui des boxeurs ,  en effet , en sautillant autour et en le frappant , pieds poings ,  tu perds pas mal de calories et c'est bon pour la confiance en soit et le coeur .     Sinon , elle peut danser en musique , seule ou pas ,   bref , il faut qu'elle combine le sport avec ses restriction alimentaires .|`|T48FKVPkaa	pas mal son rgime si elle veut faire une hypoglycmie ou si non je lui conseillerais de faire 4 repas par jour sans graisse et sans sucres rapides.  Et surtout de faire de l'exercice physique : marche  pied, un peu de sport|`|19c84fbd7ce7522e26f48f9153fc03d5aa	Faut bouger, marcher etc...    1 m 65, 61 kg ce n'es tpas bien excessif, si elle perd 5 kilos ce sera bon.     Sauter les repas ce n'est pas terrible. Puis un beau jour quand elle aura tout perdu elle remangera et reprendra ses kilos avec surplus  Faut penser au sport,mais bon faut pas esprer tout perdre en un mois.     Moi qd j'ai commenc  travailler j'ai pris 10 kilos! Le stress du aux tudes tait fini, Je me permettais de manger tt ce que je me privais  cause de la dche, puis les restos entre collgues, ?a n'a pas pardonn!  De 59 Kilos pour 1m65 je suis passe  69!  j'ai fait un petit rgime je suis retombe  64 mais petit  petit j'ai absolument tout repris.    L'ide d'arriver  70 kilos me hantait,en plus je commen?ais  souffrir du dos, consquence de ma prise de poids. J'ai fait du sport en salle mais franchement je n'y allais qu'une semaine et j'arrtais.Alors j'ai suivi le conseil qu'on voit partout  la pub : Bougez le plus possible.  Moi j'ai commenc tout en douceur mais vraiment sans me forcer. je suis pas trs discipline et si je suis trop contraignante je vais pas tenir un mois.    Je marche en moyenne 30 minutes , minimum un jour sur deux , simplement en rentrant du boulot  pied qui est  30 minutes de chez moi. Mais l'idl serait tous les jours . Des fois quand il fait froid, je prends la voiture ou le bus mais  chez moi je fais alors 30 minutes de vlo d'appartement, ou de stepper (les petits steppers qui coutent pas cher) sans me forcer, au niveau le moins fort.    ou alors les jours o j'ai le courage je me lve un peu plus t?t et je vais au boulot  pied et je rentre  pied. ?a me fait 1 heure de marche en tout.    Avec ?a qui n'est franchement pas dur, je suis   un peu moins de 66 kilos. Mais 3 kilos perdus quand mme en quatre mois. Mais faut savoir aussi qu'avec le sport, on fond mais on ne perd pas beaucoup de poids, la graisse tant remplace par le muscle.En plus je mange toute la malbouffe de la terre, ayant la flemme de toujours cuisiner, je prends souvent des plats prpars.     mais je suis pas presse. Pus j'augmente petit  petit la dure et l'endurance sur mon vlo.Mme si ?a me prend un an pour tout perdre c'est pas grave.      Donc si ta copine est plus discipline que moi, qu'elle mange quilibr sans se priver de rien mais en diminuant la frquence des "crasses" (frites, patisseries)  1 fois par semaine, et qu'elle se met au sport, en 3 mois elle aura perdu ses kilos en trop pour de bon. Pour ne pas les reprendre, un peu de marche rgulire suffira|`|Or2dnHF1aa	il faut manger rgulirement mais en petite quantit!!!! ce qu'elle fait est trs mauvais mme si j'admets que c'est trs tentant quand on veut maigrir vite!mais pas du tout efficace! bon courage  elle...|`|w1iZikLmaa	Ton amie n'est pas grosse ,peut tre a t elle besoin de se remuscler afin de s'affiner, d'avoir une jolie silhouette?

Ensuite, elle peut, lors du djeuner,  midi, moins manger : c'est--dire prendre une salade ou un plat consistant plus un fruit pourquoi pas.  Le soir, en revanche : potage ou petite soupe maison avec des lgumes frais du jardin ou achet dans le commerce avec un yaourt...  Si elle a vraiment de gros soucis, qu'elle consulte un spcialiste, mais les vrais rgimes n'existent pas, selon moi.  C'est  force de persvrance et de travail journalier qu'elle doit arriver  son but.

2Urd6VLqaa	First I want to commend you for wearing perscription lenses. The ones you can buy from the mall will scar your corneas, and can even cause you to go blind.    I work at an optomitrists office, and the advice I can give you would be to call your optomitrist. He can tell you exactly what lenses will work for you, and can give you trials.    ?|`|3ca77814669342ed7f9e8a6abb737a33aa	i think acuve might have some. ive never tried the color ones but there suppose to have the best contact lenses out there... =]|`|PbIQTFWVaa	get grey or dark brownish green|`|MwULSyquaa	get green ones! they would look awesome, just make sure they dont look fake. fake eyes looks wierd|`|n2Tc3Vjcaa	gray!  green contacts would b hawt!  lolz.|`|SfvbFyFiaa	i dont but i have a website u can load to turn your eyes different colors in pics its gimp. click the overlay button [where it says normal] and click the thing that looks like a spray gun its awesome go to google and look up gimp|`|nhgwIhBLaa	I think that the grey would be nice.

iVNsqPyRaa	Oi!    O que acontece com a depila??o a cera na barriga,  o que acontece nos outros stios do corpo, eles n?o diminuem, mas podem ficar menos grossos. No entanto, provocar o encravamento dos plos e ficar inesttico...para o evitar o ideal  a esfolia??o semanal (com cremes esfoliantes ou esponjas com o mesmo efeito).    Se queres livrar-te mesmo deles a solu??o mais duradoura  a depila??o a laser ou luz pulsada. Aqui em Portugal j existem clnicas bastante acessveis, deduzo que no Brasil tambm ;). A solu??o n?o  completamente definitiva, mas os plos que voltam a crescer (nem todos voltam) s?o mais fracos. Dura mais ou menos dois anos e dentro desse tempo dever ser feita manuten??o (mas j com menos sess?es, uma ou duas chega).    Tem tambm em aten??o que plos nessa rea pode significar altera??es hormonais (no caso das mulheres).|`|di1E90yLaa	Voce pode descolorir com gua oxigenada, isso vai disfar?ar bem, boa sorte|`|fO7IPdf6aa	n?o  que v?o diminuir  mas  melhro tirar com cera quente mesmo  fica uns 3 meses sem nasce de novo  fica bom..   a melhor op??o|`|846bb2404f63cce54c792c6682b7ea65aa	Mais ou menos, mas com certeza, mas tarde voltar?o.|`|8IrEpSx6aa	N?o fa?a isso!  conforme vc vai tirando eles ,eles v?o engrossando e cada vez mais vc vai notar que est?o crescendo mais plos do que antes!|`|ESyfc0kRaa	se forem muitos arranque com cera, se forem poucos basta descolorar!!    ps. se fizer com cera, com o tempo eles v?o ficando mais fracos e escassos sim!|`|LsARAuy4aa	eu fa?o depila??o com cera quente  10 anos e n?o diminuir?o nada so demora um pouco a crescer|`|InqjqqG3aa	Com cera quente, com certeza vc n?o ter problemas, pois eles demoram cerca de 2 meses para crescer... eu fa?o e recomendo...

JYlVPBMGaa	you can't.... just pull them back with a bobby pin until they grow out. it won't take that long trust me...I've been through this before|`|hnItHP6yaa	Bangs grow faster than you think.  Get some cute headbands and some cute barrettes and pin them back.  They'll grow longer soon and then you'll be able to fix them!  Don't worry it'll work out.  Seventeen magazine had an article on this issue, but I don't remember their other ideas.|`|xKWMm82Maa	You DON'T fix it on your own. Did you get them cut in a salon? If so, why did you leave the salon if they were crooked?    Unless you know what you're doing, don't cut your own hair please... I don't even trust myself with a pair of scissors when it comes to my hair. You risk messing it up even more!|`|PQ4WEQr5aa	Pin them back until they grow out.

I did NOT like it either... just let it grow out it wont take that long!!
hnItHP6yaa	Do a kinda short, shaggy haircut.  Thats a good hair cut for guys.  Can't go wrong.  Think about how the models have their hair cut in Hollister or Abercrombie pictures.  Like that.  Think short (around ears), kinda shaggy to look messy.    Always looks good on a guy!|`|0WOHYwjsaa	u could cut it short then spike it up or just leave it like it is
QoMzpnDEaa	I have actually used one of those before. For me, it didn't work, but it seems to be different for everyone. If I were you, I would go ahead and try one more time, but not for as long as you had it on  the last time. Just put it on for a little less time that it says to put on, and see how it looks.    If that doesn't work, check the ingredients because it could be something that is in the patch that your skin could be sensitive to, or that you are allergic to.    Hope I helped =D|`|DiQrZi3Vaa	In my experience, they work well but oil builds up and oxidizes again naturally, so blackheads will come back. Since blackheads are caused when oil oxidizes, I would recommend using a gentle exfoliating scrub once a week to minimize oil that gets clogged in pores. I hope that helps! P.S. Please help me by answering the question I recently posted! Thank you!|`|168b0545256a120599bd0115deaa4a3baa	ya it worked for me.... i dont think they could cause more though. Its just a sticky strip that pulls it out. Did you let it dry completely and then pull it off slowly?     You might also want to try a blackhead popper. They sell them at make up stores.    I suggest you go to Sephora|`|J4XpqEetaa	I've tried, it doesn't seem to work much on the blackheads but it sure does work for my whiteheads on my nose.  It might be the brand I tried. Biore was the brand I used.|`|5xtSKG8daa	Not as much as you would like them to.|`|oNchHZIlaa	not really for me but i like to use them if i get a zit on my nose. totally takes it out.|`|TKaYnlYnaa	yes i use Biore's nose strips. and it works well for me but you should use a gentle exfolating scrub for your face to slough off the dead skin and it might help to treat blackheads easier|`|EXNdGyLtaa	I use them every other month - every three months or so, and they work for me. Try Biore (or something like that). You have to get them wet, put them on, wait for them to COMPLETELY DRY (longer than the directions say), get them wet, then pull them off. All of your blackheads should be gone. They are super inexpensive, too ($15 I think)!        I hope this helps!
kTqmaJeVaa	i dont have a pic, but tell your hair dresser to keep your natural shape but trim it up a little bit  10-25 $ depending on the place.  btw, dont go ANYWHERE afterward  your forhead is going to be very red.  and the wax may irritate your skin.|`|168b0545256a120599bd0115deaa4a3baa	The person knows exactly what to do.

It can cost anwhere from 15-45 bucks...depending on where you go. If it's your first time getting it shaped, then I'd suggest you go to a good place and pay a bit more because if you mess up your eyebrows once, it'll never go back to normal. Also, best results are when they are tweezed, so if you can go somewhere and get them tweezed rather than waxed..ur golden!    good luck!|`|f5BoKPjNaa	Natural shape is best but trim a little so it isn't all bushy n ugly. My regular spa charges 18 dollers for tweezing but they look fantastic afterwards. It kinda hurts afterwards but worth it. Try to look for a spa and not just any random place.

UpbcYg7Zaa	Well, get some concealer, try it and see if it makes you feel better. If you like it - keep wearing it! If it doesn't make any difference then, no point in wearing more makeup. Wear whatever you feel most comfortable with :)  Also, no, it is unlikely that concealer will damage your skin in the future though, remember to always remove it properly, and keep in place a good skin care routine to avoid any clogged pores!|`|gaPpPgokaa	USE CONCEALER|`|E1K685ZNaa	always get a concealer or base with spf in it, this will actually HELP your skin from the sun's rays! i mean 14 does kinda sound young so i might try concealer!|`|gl2E3tXFaa	i dont think your too young but i do think its vest not to start cuz without it you will feel naked   get what i mean?    hopexx|`|yUnipCSaaa	i think its the powder that ur using bcuz wen u r that young and u use powder it causes things like that, and i would advice u to use proactive, there is a moisturizer that u could use to get rid of all ur dark spots|`|FxAWhiTWaa	No, as long as you wash your face and remove your makeup at night you'll be fine.

Por eso es muy importante comenzar desde temprana edad a cuidar nuestra piel e intentar retrasar los efectos del envejecimiento, y para ello tenemos a nuestro alcance distintos tipos de cremas:    Hidratantes:   Estas cremas incluyen aceites esenciales y lpidos que hidratan incluso las pieles ms secas, sin provocar la aparicin de espinillas y granitos.    Antienvejecimiento:   Normalmente compuestas por antirradicales libres, antioxidantes (vitaminas A, E y C) y filtros UV, que evitan que el tabaco, la contaminacin atmosfrica y los rayos del sol aceleren el envejecimiento de nuestra piel.    Antiarrugas:   En su composicin incluyen alfahidroxicidos (derivados de cidos frutales), el cido gliclico y el cido retinico, que regeneran las zonas tratadas mediante un micropeeling, haciendo que aparezca una piel nueva.    Antimanchas:   Estn compuestas de sustancias (como la hidroquinona) que evitan la formacin de melanina, que es la causante de la hiperpigmentacin y el oscurecimiento de la piel.    Mascarillas:   Son exfoliantes y eliminan las clulas muertas de la capa ms externa de la piel. Con una vez a la semana obtendremos una piel libre de impurezas.       Breve glosario de compuestos cosmticos   Muchas de las cremas que estamos acostumbradas a utilizar llevan en su composicin una serie de elementos que nos resultan incomprensibles . Ahora te  resumire un poco de lo que son algunas de estas sustancias:     Aceite de echium  Es el aceite de borraja que acta como antiirritante.    Aceite de Karit y olivo  Son dos tipos de aceites vegetales cuyas propiedades ayudan a mejorar la hidratacin de la piel.    cido hialurnico  Se usa en cosmticos y en ciruga plstica para alisar la piel y eliminar arrugas del contorno de ojos y boca. En conjuncin con las ceramidas y el colgeno, forman el pegamento de las clulas de la piel.    Alfahidroxicidos  Son los derivados de los cidos frutales que se utilizan para eliminar las arrugas y las manchas.    Arcilla  Suele emplearse para tratar pieles grasas porque acta resecndolas.    Arbutina  Es una sustancia despigmentante que evita la formacin de melanina y la aparicin de manchas.    B-Glucn  Sustancia que estimula la autohidratacin de nuestra piel.    Colgeno  Son fibras de tejido en las dermis de la piel que favorecen la cohesin celular.    Carnosina  Es una sustancia que protege la piel contra el humo de tabaco y la polucin.    Cristofina  Se obtiene del calabacn y sirve para hidratar la piel.   Extracto de alga verde  Esta sustancia sirve para remineralizar la piel y tambin como antiirritante.    Extracto de ale  Tiene propiedades que hidratan y suavizan la piel.    Extracto de lino  Con esta sustancia ayudamos a la piel a fortalecer la barrera cutnea y a eliminar la irritacin.    Extracto de soja  Con l hidrataremos la piel, y sobretodo a la de tipo seco.    Hidroquinona  Es una sustancia hipopigmentante, o sea que elimina la melanina sobrante de la piel.    Lactoferrina  Es un extracto derivado lcteo que sirve para proteger la piel contra los radicales libres.    Liposomas  La funcin de los liposomas es ayudar a difundir las sustancias que contienen. Estn formados por una estructura de dos capas de grasa, que pueden encontrarse en todas las membranas biolgicas de los seres vivos, incluido el hombre, por eso son biodegradables y no txicos.    Melanina  Es el pigmento defensivo que se produce en las capas medias de la piel y emerge al exterior cuanto sta sufre una agresin. Es el responsable del bronceado y de las manchas.    Radicales libres  Son unas molculas que atacan a las clulas sanas y se producen por accin de los rayos UVA del sol o de las mquinas de rayos artificiales y por la contaminacin atmosfrica.    Retinol  Esta sustancia es un derivado de la vitamina A que sirve para ayudar a reparar la piel.

Espero te sirva mi respuesta en resumen tu puedes hacer tu propia crema y combinas algunas vitaminas y estractos de aceites cada una para cada cosa que necesitae y tu piel quedara como una diosa que te lo digo yo que la mia es super espectacular.         |`|GpTApvjeaa	El JOHNSON  o bien el aceite de almendras .|`|btVOtfNIaa	la verdad es ke la crema mas hidratante de todas es la nivea azul de toda la vida es la crema con mas grasa sera perfecta si la convinas con aceite jhonson  cuando salgas de la ba?era.

Some do it by applying a good bronzer on the side of the face, just a liitle below where your cheeks and ear meet. |`|FxAWhiTWaa	you can contour many ways.   1. Using  foundation that's a shade darker than your actual skin tone around the bridge of the nose and by the cheekbones.  2. Using a bronzer from the cheekbones in a sweeping motion to the hairline.  3. Using the bronzer or concealer on the cheekbone area and then using  blush on the apples of your cheeks to give the face alot of dimension.   all three techniques look good, see which one looks the best on you .   oh yea, and practice makes perfect. good luck.
