My wife & I socialize with another couple whose company we do enjoy.  She (of the other couple) & I, however, sometimes butt heads on silly things, such as this.  My contention is that the wine was a gift and its the host's choice; hers is that it may be a gift, but it should be served immediately.  Further, if it isn't served, it should be saved until the next time the same two couples are together again.  I believe this is exceptionally far-fetched and that the recipient has the choice of when to serve it and who to serve it to.

I want to ask my neighbor about a business she used to have in her home so I thought about inviting her & her husband over for dinner. My husband & I eat salad almost everyday. I thought about buying the ingredients & letting them fix their own. I don't know how to present that b/c we usually just buy the veggies from the salad bar at our store. So we take out the amount of spinach we want & put it in a bowl to mix it with the oil & vinegar we use & then we add all the other things we want. We toast walnuts, etc. Is there a more attractive way to serve this. I could also make pasta but I don't have any other ideas. What would you serve to people who you know & like but haven't spent much time with to know what kind of food they like or dislike?

Now, on to the question (sorry if its long)   Okay. So about 4 weeks ago, I became vegetarian, like suddenly. One day I was eating everything imaginable, the next nothing. no meat, no fish, not even chicken. Well it was all going well, my parents were fine with it (im 13 by the way) and they were supporting me 100% other than the fact that they were scared because no one in our family has EVER been a vegetarian. So anyway, i ended up getting sick and for the past 3 days ive been home sick. I went to the doctors today, and my doctor totaly flipped when she heard i went veggie. It was like a coming to jesus visit. lol. she was all like you shouldnt be making this desicion at 13! i was like pshhh. haha anyway, she wants me to find a nutritionist and wants me to research this more so i dont end up screwing myself up. so what I need help with is can you help me? like help me find some more website on a balanced  vegetarian diet and all. im trying to find a nutritionist now, but i kinda need some help.    thanks so much! i really need help!!!   xoxo   kenzie

20090128105220AAlh6Yz	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Green colored muffin but not pistachio?	Is there any other green-colored muffin out there that is not pistachio but looks like pistachio muffin? I had this reaaaaally yummy green-colored muffin over a vacation. It was smooth, didn't taste too nutty (even closer to corn bread), no pistachio (or other nuts) fragments inside, and it just looked like pistachio muffin. Since then I bought three different pistachio muffins in different stores, and none tasted like the one I had during vacation.       Any ideas?

20090128114544AAwR34i	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	Need help with Easter Candy..?	It's a lil early for Easter candy but every year I search for my fav candy and come short every year...      There is this one particular candy that I used to love.  It tasted similar to candy corn.  It was in shapes of different styles of bunnie [it usually had 3 shapes in the bag].  It have been atleast 5 years since I ate the candy but I believe the candy was two toned.  It usually had white on the top and a pastel color [usually pink, orange, green, or yellow) below..      Another candy I love, which I just started seeing recently, is these fruit chews like candy.  It came in an assortment of green [lime], pink [strawberry], orange [orange], and purple [grape].  They was squared-shape.        I have been searching all over the net this..  I would like, if possible, to buy them wholesale from an online supplier and be able to enjoy them year round.      Does any one know the name or brand or any other information regarding these candies??  Thanks...
