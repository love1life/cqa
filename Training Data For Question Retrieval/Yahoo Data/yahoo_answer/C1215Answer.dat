ya23tskXaa	Answer: You can use the Hardy-Weinberg equation (p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1)  Gene frequencies  R: 0.645 (p)  r: 0.355 (q)    Genotypic frequencies  homozygous dominant (p2): 0.416  heterozygous (2pq) : 0.458  homozygous recessive (q2): 0.126    The conditions for a population to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are:  1. No mutations  2. No gene flow (no immigration/emigration)  3. No Genetic drift  5. No Natural selection  4. Random mating    It is highly unrealistic that any population will be in this equilibrium because it is hard to control most of those variables.    Using the Hardy-Weinberg equation in this population you cannot effectively PREDICT the future frequencies due to the changing conditions however, it is perfectly acceptable to use the equation with the data collected to calculate the instantaneous gene and genotypic frequencies. Note that the population is NOT in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

Maybe a little taller, but unless you stood an "ancient" man next to a Today Man, side-by-side, you couldn't tell the difference.    We DO have pictures of people from that time -- old wood cuttings and hand drawings, even a few painted artworks.    They look just like us.  Dress them up in modern clothes, and you couldn't tell the difference.    The appearance of man hasn't changed appreciably in about 20,000 years.    BTW: WW2 was only about 70 years ago, not 1000.

What is the doctor's follow-up plans for you---has he communicated them to you?----if the current course of therapy does not resolve?  If you are unhappy with your treatment, get a 2nd opinion or another doctor.    One more thing:  you should be communicating with your doctor these concerns and words you have written here...which only takes a minute of the doctor's time.  If he seems too busy to listen to you or attend to this, you definitely need another medical care provider.    Believe me:  not all doctors go to the office worrying about your case AS THEY SHOULD.

N0UUmjDlaa	For press/ peel, you will need to use a mirror image of the pattern, so if necessary, reverse it... perhaps in a drawing programme.  It needs to be printed in a laser printer, or copied in a copier that uses powder toner.  The board is prepared by lightly sanding it to give a slightlyrough texture to it, either wet or dry sanding with (say) 600 grit. Be very careful to ensure the entire surface is cleaned off.   I usually cut the board oversize to start.  Wash and dry the board, then give it a wipe with acetone and a lint free paper or cloth.  Cut the print so there is not too much overhang. Place the prepared board over the print, and hold it in place while you turn it over, place it on a hard board (I use a board of MDF), and use masking tape (it stands the heat better) to stick the image to the MDF board, trapping the PCB material.  Iron with a dry clothes iron, follow the instructions for the press/ peel material used. Make sure the entire PCB and transfer medium are evenly heated. Allow to cool, and then remove the backing. You can touch up (if necessary) with a Dalo pen, or I use pens intended and marketed as CD markers. Much cheaper.  No, you don't need elaborate equipment to etch the board, I use a plastic icecream container, anything plastic will suffice.  I use ferric chloride by choice, it can be bought as a solution, or in dry powder form to mix with water. It can be reused many times before it "runs out of steam". I store it in a glass coffee jar with a plastic lid between uses.  I often solder a couple of copper wires to the edge of the copper of the board, but you may not need to bother.  Etch the copper face down in the solution. It works faster. If you wish, just jiggle it a bit occasionally. Don't work in a too cold place, though.  Fresh solution will etch the copper off in around 20 mins or so. It will begin to eat it from the outside in, so when you lift the board out to check its progress, watch the most central area for copper left.  If I don't attach wires to lift it with, I just use a plastic implement ( an electronics tuning screwdriver) to slide the board to a point where I can get hold of it. I lift it upmaking sure I don't drop ferric chloride everywhere. If the etching is complete, take the board (without dripping) to the kitchen sink or an outside tap, or use a bucket of water, to wash the board off.  I use steel wool or a stainless steel scourer to remove the toner. Wash and dry the finished board. It can now be cut to final dimensions, and the component holes drilled, by whatever means you have. I actually use a low- voltage engraver, with a drill bit suitably made smaller by grinding. I drill all holes the same small size, then any that need to be larger, I use drill bits in a drill chuck (not attached to a machine) and open them out by twisting it by hand. It may be necessary to very slightly countersink the component holes with a somewhat larger drill bit to remove any copper that has puckered from drilling, and clean the fibreglass side of the holes.  A coat of solder- through varnish can be applied to keep the board from oxidising after final cleaning.  Ferric chloride will corrode steel, so seal it up and keep it in a suitable place, wash out the plastic container, and wash your hands.  For the quantity of it I might get on my fingers, I don't consider it dangerous.  I actually use light bubblejet photo print paper... its cheap, and works reasonably well. The ideal one is a clay- faced paper, I am told, if you can identify it as being so.   I also design my boards in a free programme called "Express PCB". It additionally has a schematic editor.   It doesn't have a large component inventory, but you can make your own as you go along.  For iron- on work, I use the TOP layer, as when printed, it is reverse as is needed.  Any printing I want to appear on the board, can be done on the BOTTOM layer, and it will print in reverse if you select "print top and bottom layers" when printing.|`|TMbfzg8Faa	You don't NEED chemicals, just toner paper. But you can use Sodium persulfate Na2S2O8 natriumpersulfat|`|X8LNbaKQaa	My favorite way to use ferric chloride etchant is to make a puddle in a saucer or plate that is just deep enough that one surface of the board is wetted while the board rests on its corners on the sloping edge of the dish.  You lay the board down, one edge first and slowly swing it down onto the surface of the etchant.  The fresh etchant is less dense than that which has reacted with copper, so no agitation is necessary.  Convection will keep  bringing fresh solution up to the board.  If the board is one sided, it is often possible to see the copper disappear through the back of the board.  Otherwise, you have to slowly swing the board up every 5 minutes or so and see how things are going.  Slow movement is necessary to keep from trapping bubbles under the board.  the meniscus should crawl up the board as it is slowly lowered.     This way, a board can often be etched with only a few ounces of etchant and that is pretty well used uo after one or two boards, ready to be neutralized with washing soda for disposal as a noncorrosive solid.    --   Regards,    John Popelish

uKdf9xWBaa	Under normal circumstances the pulse rate and the strength of the pulse are equal and in both wrists.     In some instances the pulse may not be equal in strength or the pulse may be totally absent in one wrist, due to proximal obstruction in one side, secondary to causes like arteriosclerosis, hematomas, proximal arterial disruption from  trauma (with or without an open wound), thoracic outlet obstruction (be it from tumor or that rarely seen cervical rib syndrome). The disparity in pulse strength depends entirely on the degree of obstruction. The cervical rib is an interesting phenomenon. During abduction and external rotation of the shoulder the pulses distal to the subclavian artery, i.e., brachial, radial, ulnar pulses are totally lost, due to compression of subclavian artery by the transverse process (the cervical rib) of  the 7th cervical vertebra. There are other causes of unequal radial pulse like aortic coarctation, cardiac tamponade, pericardial effusion, and tension pneumothorax, etc...   This has satisfied your question, I hope.|`|a4kTbjfeaa	Do you mean the pulse rate? The rate should be the same in both wrists.

Those both are 7 so you just say 7. There is no common number for 2 so you multiply 7 and 2 you get the lowest common multiple.

uHBvK4Vaaa	Lets say there is a gene that encodes for a protein that determines eye color. It's the "eye color" gene. One version of the "eye color" gene creates blue eyes. Another version (with a different sequence) creates brown eyes. These 2 versions are alleles of the "eye color" gene.  Different alleles, same gene.   Note that there can be many, many different alleles for a gene (brown, blue, green, hazel, etc.), but we only have 2. The reason that humans have 2 alleles of each gene is because we have 2 of each chromosome (one from each of our parents). All of the DNA we have is in duplicate, essentially. We may have 2 of the same alleles (brown, brown) or two different alleles (brown, blue), but we always have two of each.    Hope this helps.

NmjvoF4maa	Good question!    In a planet forming disk, the rocky material is near to the star, and the icy materials are farther out. Gas is cleared out from the inner region of a solar system by the star. Thus, we expect inner worlds to be rocky, and outer worlds to be icy and/or gaseous. This is what we find in our solar system.    However planets can migrate. A gas planet can interact with its planet-forming disk and spiral inward toward its star. It will stop falling inward when the planet reaches the inner edge of the planet-forming disk. We see planets like this a lot orbiting many stars, such as 51 Pegasi, HD 209458, HD 189733.    Solar systems around other stars are proving to be very diverse, and we're still figuring all this stuff out.|`|2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	"compistition" - hmmm, interesting word.

So it should look like this:    5/6 x 100/1    You multiply the two numerators (the top numbers) and get 500 (5x100=500) and the two denominators (the bottom numbers) and get 6 (6x1=6). So you get 500/6 and that is 83 and 2/6. Which is 83 1/3 simplified.    So that's your answer: 83 1/3.    Hope that helps!|`|BkkEE2Jbaa	Hm-mm...... mind boggeling. Five, hmmm yes final answer.

There are a lot of interesting ideas that are possible to build, able to sell at a price that will make a good profit - but no one wants to buy them.

UAYzLyN4aa	Depends on the efficiency of the cell, and the operating conditions.     Raw sunlight under ideal conditions (high noon, clear blue skies, summertime, clean cells, in the southwest US - not southern california; I'm talking Arizona and New Mexico) is good for about 1000 watts per square meter.     Other times of day are worse. Other places are worse. Other times of year are worse. Cells covered with dust or dirt are worse. And of course, any other weather conditions are worse.     PV cells you and I can afford range in efficiency from around 6% (the junk they put in e.g. solar powered calculators; these are basically "floor sweepings") to 10% (older stuff made for rooftops) to maybe 15% (the best rooftop panels in common use). Military and satellite applications can afford up to 30% efficient cells, but you and I cannot, not yet; they cost much more in up front cost than the improvement in efficiency.     So, for example: A 10% efficient cell will produce about 100 watts/square meter under those ideal condtions - 0.10 x  1000.      Most cell arrays are set up for 12 volt output, so this would be about 8 amps.    You cannot, of course, count on this for full time output.

vrJJQVllaa	The vinegar - baking soda reaction is endothermic, it's a reaction that needs heat to make it happen.    This is easy to prove. Just add about 50 ml of vinegar to the bottom of a drinking glass, Place a thermometer inside the glass and add a few teaspoons of baking powder. In a minute you will see the temperature drop by about 5 degrees C.     It's best to do this experiment in the kitchen sink because it gets a little messy with the carbon dioxide gas being released.    The reaction between baking soda and vinegar is actually two reactions, an acid base reaction followed by a decomposition reaction.     1) When the two ingredients are mixed, hydrogen ions ( H+) from the vinegar react with the bicarbonate ions (HCO3- ) from the baking soda to form a new chemical called carbonic acid (H2CO3).       2) The carbonic acid thus formed then immediately decomposes into carbon dioxide gas (CO2) and water (H2O).    H2CO3 ---> H2O + CO2    It's this carbon dioxide gas that you see bubbling and foaming as soon as you mix baking soda and vinegar together.|`|kqMDKMhNaa	baking soda + vinegar = base plus acid which yields a salt, water, and energy which is given off in the form of heat.

AA10758548	Alkanes are acyclic saturated hydrocarbons. As the name suggest, they are made of hydrongens (H) and carbons (C).  Carbons in an alkane are linked together by single bonds.  The general formula for alkanes is CnH2n+2; the simplest possible alkane is therefore methane, CH4. The next simplest is ethane, C2H6; the series continues indefinitely. Each carbon atom in an alkane has sp3 hybridization.    Alkanes are also known as paraffins, or collectively as the paraffin series. These terms also used for alkanes whose carbon atoms form a single, unbranched chain. Such branched-chain alkanes are called isoparaffins. Nearly all alkanes are combustible, which means alkane react with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O) and heat.|`|AA12164032	alkanes are made from hydrogen and carbon only, with the rate  C(n)H(2n+2), they don`t have any multiple links between carbons. they are also called paraffins, because they don`t react too much with other compounds. examples: propane, butane (3, respectively 4 carbon atoms) - found in your regular body spray.  and i don`t know what else to say without getting technical...  good luck!|`|278a8e1da5a48ba3b19cc4f7383ccae2aa	Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons, meaning that every spot on the carbon that can form a bond is occupied.  The formula for an alkane is C(n)H(2n+2).  So the simplest alkane has one carbon and four hydrogens: CH4.  The next simplest is C2H6, ethane.  Then propane, butane, and so on.  Alkanes only take this naming convention if they're unbranched chains.  Nearly all alkanes are combustible, forming CO2 (carbon dioxide) and H2O (water).|`|AA12206602	Introduction    Alkanes are one of the hydrocarbon families that have only sp3 carbons. Each carbon atom in the molecule is surrounded by single co-valent bonds. As a result, the molecules are tetrahedrally shaped and are non-polar molecules since all of the C-H bond dipoles cancel each other. The general molecular formula for the members of the alkane family is:     CnH2n+2    where n = number of carbon atoms in the alkane molecule     The first ten normal members of the alkane family have n values of 1-10. A normal hydrocarbon alkane is one where all the carbon atoms in the molecule are in a "continuous" chain. A continuous chain does not necessarily mean that the carbons are in a straight line. The carbons can "snake" or "zig zag" as long as you can trace through the carbons without lifting the tracer off the surface.     Return To The List at the Top           First Ten Normal Alkane Members:Homologous Series  In the following table we have identified the first ten normal members of the alkane family and their IUPAC names. We will concentrate on the naming of Organic Compounds using the IUPAC Nomenclature System     The following table of normal Hydrocarbon alkanes represent a homologous series. An homologous series is a series of compounds that differ in succession by a constant increase in Carbons and Hydrogens from one member to another in the series:     Normal Alkanes    Molecular Formula      Structural Formula       IUPAC Name      CH4                           CH4                 Methane  C2H6                         CH3-CH3               Ethane  C3H8                       CH3-CH2-CH3             Propane  C4H10                     CH3-(CH2)2-CH3            Butane  C5H12                     CH3-(CH2)3-CH3            Pentane  C6H14                      CH3-(CH2)4-CH3            Hexane  C7H16                      CH3-(CH2)5-CH3            Heptane  C8H18                       CH3-(CH2)6-CH3            Octane  C9H20                       CH3-(CH2)7-CH3            Nonane  C10H22                      CH3-(CH2)8-CH3            Decane  Notice that all the alkanes above end in "ane". This is considered the official IUPAC ending for alkanes.       Return To The List at the Top         Constitutional Isomers:Branched Alkanes  There are many alkanes that are not normal. In other words not all of the carbon atoms in the molecule form a continuous chain of carbons. Some of the carbons are branched off of the continuous chain. These branched hydrocarbons may have the same molecular formula as a normal alkane but the way that the atoms are connected to one another differ. Whenever two or more compounds have the same molecular formula but differ in the way they are connected, they are referred to as "constitutional isomers".       Return To The List at the Top         IUPAC Rules For Naming Alkanes  Determine the longest continuous chain of carbons that have the functional group attached to one of the carbons. By "longest continuous chain" is meant to be able to trace through the carbons without raising the tracer (or finger) off the surface. The chain does not necessarily have to be straight.   Identify the various branching groups attached to this continuous chain of carbons by name   Number the carbons in the chain so that the groups would be attached to the carbons with the lowest designated number. This means that you have to decide whether to number beginning on the right end or left end of the chain. The answer to that question will depend upon what the sequence numbers will be that establish the location of the branched groups. For example, if you number one way so that three branched groups are attached on number designated carbons 3,5,6 in a six carbon continuous chain and then number the six carbons in the opposite direction so that these same branched groups are attached to carbons designated as 1,2,4, then the proper numbering would be the second way where the designated numbers would be 1, 2, 4. A good way to decide is to add up the designated numbers in the sequence. The lowest sum would be the direction you would number of the carbons in the continuous chain.   Name the branched groups in alphabetical order attaching (hyphenating) the carbon number it is attached to along the continuous chain of carbons to the front of the branch name.   If more than one of the same kind of branched group is attached to the chain, identify the number carbon each group is attached to as a series of numbers separated by commas between each number then a hyphen and finally use a greek prefix attached to the branch name. For example, if there were three methyl groups (CH3) attached to the 2,3,and 5 carbons along the chain, then that part of the name would be   2,3,5-trimethyl.    We use the prefix "tri" because there are three methyl groups     The greek prefixes used are as follows:     di for 2   tri for three   tetra for four   penta for five   hexa for six   hepta for seven   octa for eight   Identify the carbon number where the functional group is located or attached     End the name by attaching the normal alkane name corresponding to the number of carbon atoms in the normal alkane.     Here is an example of naming an alkane with the proper IUPAC name.     Identify the IUPAC name of the following:     CH3-CH-CH-CH2-CH-CH2-CH3      |  |     |     CH3 CH3    CH3  Identify the longest continuous chain of carbons.   The longest chain is seven carbons long     Identify the branches   There are three methyl groups branched off the continuous chain     Number the carbons in the continuous chain so that the three methyl groups will be attached to the lowest numbe
AA12348431	Sorry to say but there are no eureka moments in mathematics. There is only a couple of tips that I can give you: practice and practice smart. And focus and pay attention at class. When you practice though, dont practice using just one question book. Try different ones and try different levels of difficulty. The thing about academical mathematics is that the more you are experienced with many questions, the better you become. If you encounter a question that you cant do, ask somebody who can. Pay attention to the way of solving rather than the answer itself. All the best. Love+peace|`|AA11198972	It's kinda hard to explain.

b40d3ccccf0ccc2a80c37fcf581e6357aa	String theory is a model of fundamental physics whose building blocks are one-dimensional extended objects (strings) rather than the zero-dimensional points (particles) that are the basis of the Standard Model of particle physics. For this reason, string theories are able to avoid problems associated with the presence of pointlike particles in theories of physics. Studies of string theories have revealed that they predict not just strings, but also higher-dimensional objects.    The basic idea is that the fundamental constituents of reality are strings of energy of the Planck length (about 10-35 m) which vibrate at resonant specific frequencies[1]. Another key claim of the theory is that no measurable differences can be detected between strings that wrap around dimensions smaller than themselves and those that move along larger dimensions (i.e., physical processes in a dimension of size R match those in a dimension of size 1/R). Singularities are avoided because the observed consequences of "big crunches" never reach zero size. In fact, should the universe begin a "big crunch" sort of process, string theory dictates that the universe could never be smaller than the size of a string, at which point it would actually begin expanding.    Interest in string theory is driven largely by the hope that it will prove to be a theory of everything. It is a possible solution of the quantum gravity problem, and in addition to gravity it can naturally describe interactions similar to electromagnetism and the other forces of nature. Superstring theories include fermions, the building blocks of matter, and incorporate supersymmetry. It is not yet known whether string theory will be able to describe a universe with the precise collection of forces and matter that is observed, nor how much freedom to choose those details that the theory will allow. String theory as a whole has not yet made falsifiable predictions that would allow it to be experimentally tested, though various special corners of the theory are accessible to planned observations and experiments. Hence critics of string theory occasionally remark that the theory "... is not even wrong," quoting a quip attributed to Wolfgang Pauli.    Work on string theory has led to advances in mathematics, mainly in algebraic geometry. String theory has also led to other theories, supersymmetric gauge theories, which will be tested at the new Large Hadron Collider experiment.|`|3de44647a7a98ab25d70c1d7392ebbd0aa	String theory is a model of fundamental physics whose building blocks are one-dimensional extended objects (strings) rather than the zero-dimensional points (particles) that are the basis of the Standard Model of particle physics.

And various frequencies, notes if you will, are the elementary particles of the universe. ITs one of the "Theories of everything" trying to explain the universe.

Also after shaving the hair that grows back is thicker at the ends and has more support, therefore less curling, after it grows out and new hair comes in it should have more curl to it.  If you don't shave for long enough it will probably begin to curl as much maybe even more then mens hair.  There are of course many other factors involved.  Some people just don't have curly hair.  Men also tend to have longer leg hair and the longer it gets the more curly it will get.
AA10752557	I am guessing at this point, but I have some experience to back it up.  Low energy ions attack the polymer surface creating two effects: etching and oxidation.  The etching causes destroyed polymer chains that increase surface area and roughness.  The oxidation attaches electron-filled oxygen groups that is attracted to metal.
AA11312558	Yes, the coefficient of variation can be negative, undefined, or zero.  That is because the mean can be negative and the mean or sd can be zero.    Now in situations in which the coefficient of variation makes the most sense to use, it wouldn't be negative or zero.  That is because it only really makes sense to talk about the coeffiecient of variation when the variation of the data is is of the same maginitude as the mean.  That means that if the mean is large, the sd is large.    One example I give my students is to compare the variation in measurements of the distance from the Earth to the Sun and from the nucleus of a hydogen atom to its electron.  Of course the measurements from the Earth to the Sun would be more variable, but that is because the distance there is much more than the distance from the nucleus to the electron of a hydrogen atom.  In that case, it makes sense to look at the coefficeint of variation.  It may turn out that the two coefficients of variation are similar.    Notice that in both cases, we are talking about data that all have positive value, so the means and sd's will all be positive.|`|9650e1cdf417d4bab696599a2277ef90aa	No, its a varable.  In probability theory and statistics, the coefficient of variation is a measure of dispersion of a probability distribution. It is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean: The coefficient of variation is a dimensionless number that allows comparison of the variation of populations that have significantly different mean values. It is often reported as on a scale of 0 to 100% by multiplying the above calculation by 100.|`|AA10961540	No.|`|AA10752557	You have to think of COF as in real world applications.  The real world does not contain negative numbers or zero.  As mentioned in the following link, that is why a COF needs a positive average and it is useless with averages close to zero.  In the real world, it is also impossible for anything to have a standard deviation of zero.  Therefore, a COF cannot be negative nor undefined.

AA10982839	the Greek mathematician Diophantus of Alexandria    Algebra has been studied for many centuries. Babylonian, and ancient Chinese and Egyptian mathematicians proposed and solved problems in words, that is, using "rhetorical algebra". However, it was not until the 3rd century that algebraic problems began to be considered in a form similar to those studied today.  In the 3rd century, the Greek mathematician Diophantus of Alexandria wrote his book Arithmetica. Of the 13 parts originally written, only six still survive, but they provide the earliest record of an attempt to use symbols to represent unknown quantities. Diophantus did not consider general methods in Arithmetica, but instead solved a large number of practical problems.  Several Indian mathematicians carried out important work in the field of algebra in the 6th and 7th centuries. These include Aryabhatta, whose book entitled Aryabhatta included work on linear and quadratic equations, and Brahmagupta, who presented a general solution for a quadratic equation.  The next major development in the history of algebra was the book al-Kitab al-muhtasar fi hisab al-jabr wa'l-muqabala ("Compendium on calculation by completion and balancing"), written by the Arabic mathematician Al-Khwarizmi in the 9th century. The word algebra is derived from al-jabr, or "completion". This book developed methods for solving six different types of quadratic equations, and contained the first systematic consideration of the subject separately from number theory.  In about 1100, the Persian mathematician Omar Khayyam wrote a treatise on algebra based on Euclid's methods. In it he identified 25 types of equations and made the first formal distinction between arithmetic and algebra. Some time later during the 12th century, Al-Khwarizmi's works were translated and became available to Western scholars. In the 13th century Leonardo Fibonacci wrote some important and influential books on algebra. Other highly influential works were those of the Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli (1445-1517), and of the English mathematician Robert Recorde (1510-1558).  Rules for solving cubic equations were discovered about 1515 by Scipione del Ferro (c. 1465-1526), and for the quartic equation by Ludovico Ferrari (1522-1565) about 1545. In 1824 Niels Henrik Abel (1802-1829) finally proved that, in general, it is not possible to give general rules of this kind for solving equations of the fifth degree or higher.  Further contributions to the symbols used in algebra were made in the late 16th century and the 17th century by Fran?ois Vite (1540-1603) and Ren Descartes, among others.  Complex and negative roots were a later discovery, and took some time to become accepted. In 1799, Karl Friedrich Gauss proved the fundamental theorem of algebra, which had been proposed as early as 1629.  In the 19th and 20th centuries algebra has become much more abstract and has grown to include much more than the theory of equations. Modern developments in algebra include group theory and the study of matrices.|`|AA12027265	Good question...wouldn't mind writing some hate mail thanking them for having to go through it in school.

632e4ae1417e052b5896511b07931332aa	I just corrected some mistakes.  If you see any others, please excuse them.  It is now 3:30 in the morning where I live, and I'm getting a bit weary.    Well, to start with . . .  D must be less than 3, because 5*3^5 > 1002.  Also, notice that 1002 is divisible by 3.  So, the other side has to be divisible by 3 as well.  3B^2 and 3C^2 are already divisible by 3, so we have to focus on A^2 and 5D^5.  As it turns out, 5D^5 will give a remainder of two when divided by three for any positive integer value of D, because it's multiplied by 5 (a number which has remainder 2 when divided by 3).  So, (A^2)/3 must yield a remainder of 1.  That limits values of A^2 to the following:  1  4  16  25  49  64  100  121  169  196  256  289  361  400  484  529  625  676  784  841  961  (I used a program to generate these, because it would have taken a while otherwise).  That isn't so important right now.  (A^2)/3 has remainder 1, and if you subtract it from the other side, you get some number with remainder 2.  (5D^2)/3 will have to have remainder 2 to restore the balance among the remainders on both sides.  D  Let's see what we have now . . .   A^2 + 3B^2 + 3C^2 = 997  And 1 is removed from the possible values for A^2.  Let us think about this for a moment . . .  The smallest possible values for B^2 and C^2 at the moment are 4 and 9.  It doesn't matter which one is which because they both have the same coefficient.  If you plug those into the equation, you get A^2 = 958, which is not one of the choices.  This also means that A^2 must be smaller than 958.  Let's try A^2 = 841.  If A^2 is 841, then 3B^2+3C^2 = 997-841 = 156.  Dividing both sides by 3, we get B^2+C^2 = 52.  Hmmm . . . that's 36+16!  So B is 4 and C is 6 (or vice versa).    In summary, one (actually two, because 4 and 6 are interchangeable among B and C) solution that is in the set of positive integers is:  A = sqrt(841) = 29  B = 4 or 6  C = 6 or 4  D = 1  There may be others, but they have to satisfy the constraints I came up with above.  Does that answer your question or what?  Have fun!  ;-)    Edit:  OK, on second thought I see that I made an error in my process above.  The value of (5D^5)/3 can have remainder 0, 1, or 2.  However, because the only values of D that satisfy the equation are 1 and 2, the only possible remainders are 1 and 2 (because 5/3 has remainder 2 and 160/3 has remainder 1).  So, that might introduce another set of possible values for A^2:  those perfect squares which yield a remainder of 2.  Again, I generate a list with a program:  Hmmm . . . that's interesting . . . there are no perfect squares less than 1002 which yield a remainder of 2 upon division by 3.  So my answer above is right even though my reason for eliminating 2 as a possible value for D was incorrect.  Have fun!|`|12011f85da0fb54b8dd064f30c2efa9daa	hmmm.. 4 variables..

What that term is probobly refering to is related to the Uncertainty Pricipal.    For very small particles, there is a minimum certainty to which thier positions and velocities can be known. Knowledge of one percludes knowledge of the other. This priceipal holds for other properties as well, such as field strength and field flux.    This means that at tiny, tiny scales, things start to get jittery and unpredictable. Below the plank length (10^-35 meters), space itself gets so convoluted that dimensions and direction have no meaning. If you were that small, you could see the back of your head. You could reach out and touch the inside of your spleen. Things are really bizzare at that scale.    The upshot is that subatomic particles exibit interesting and useful behaviors, such as passing through an apparently impermeable surface ("quantum tunneling") or "communicating" with another particle instantly at any distance, ("quantum entanglement"). These are probobly what is meant by "Quantum Sise Effects"|`|556f6a84a1e72fa5f9fa440c37251fe4aa	If I recall any of this correctly and I likely don't, quantum physics only normally happen at the subatomic level, with particles smaller than atoms, like electrons (electricity), protons (hydrogen nuclei) and neutrons.    If you are referring to a "Quantum Size Effect" you are likely referring to something going on *right at* the mathemetical boundary where combined Newtonian/Ensteinian physics ends, and where quantum physics begins.  Some atoms on the larger end of the Periodic Table of Elements, your metals and rare-earths that are more massive than Platinum I think, have some Quantum Size Effects going on because their *outer* valance electron shells are actually large enough to operate in Newtonian/Ensteinian physics more so than they would in Quantum....    But it has been a *LONG* time since I read that article....let me get you some links to look up, and keep in mind the articles in question might be from four or five years ago.

AA11252729	the universe may rotate, but no one has proven it.  it is only hypothetical.  the universe seems to have no center and no edge (boundaryless).  the real universe seems to be four-dimensional, but it may be something like the two-dimensional surface of a sphere.  there is nothing "outside" the universe, not even space-time.  to quote a dead writer, "there is no there, there".  space-time, itself, originated in the big bang.  the big bang was the whole universe, and everywhere in the universe was once the big bang.    read this:  http://www.sciam.com/print_version.cfm?a...|`|AA11925366	A. Yes  B.

I don't know much about the second part|`|aa6fd582b9181710bfb6bdd7122b5816aa	It is unlikely that the universe as a whole does rotate.      The universe is permeated by a sea of radiation left over from the last scattering surface after the big bang.  This radiation sea is called the cmbr (cosmic microwave background radiation) and recent experiments (WMAP and COBE) have mapped tiny fluctuations in the cmbr to a high degree.  If the universe was rotating then evidence of the rotation would have shown up in the cmbr.    Note that absence of evidence is not necessarily evidence of absence, so we can't definitively say the universe does not rotate, but what we can do is constrain the rotation: if it is rotating then the rotation is very very extremely small and slow.      Hope this helps!  The Chicken|`|AA10299755	As far as we know, the Universe does not rotate. If the Universe did, then it would NOT be isotropic and homogeneous. Isotropic means that the universe looks the same in every direction that we (on Earth) look. Homogeneous means that the universe looks the same to every observer.    Like you said, if the Universe has a rotation, then depending on where you are, the Universe would look and feel different i.e. center of rotation is a very special spot. Currently, it is believed that there are no such special spot.|`|AA11522841	Actually, we would know if our universe is rotating. A beam of light would exibit a slightly helical path, like if you threw a ball in the air while riding a merry-go-round. We have experimentally verified that the universe is not, in fact, rotating.    Incidentally, if it were spinning, there are theoretical paths a spaceship could follow to arrive before it left, achieving time travel to the past.     If the universe were spinning, I believe it would not spin about any particular point, just as it is not expanding from any particular point.

This *might* work for native PAGE, but your mileage may vary depending the proteins you are separating, especially if they are part of a complex.  Bio-Rad suggests 8-16% gradient; take a look at the images on the Bio-Rad page below, that may be helpful.  You should also look at Bio-Rad's protein standards page, there is a set of figures in there that show how their standards migrate in various gels.|`|AA10279106	You should post this in the biology section, probably have better luck.
AA11522841	Certain physicists theorize that the plank length and the plank time (the time it takes light to travel the plank length) are the fundimental minimum units of space and time. Experiments have failed to either prove or disprove this so far, but the general concensus is that it will be proven to be true within ten or twenty years.    If so, this is good for us, becuase below the plank length, space and time become so tangled that they cease to lose meaning; thus preventing us from ever analyzing that realm with our current understanding of the laws of physics.|`|e5516d02d646e174b1bd2c73669a2db7aa	good question - it is one of the factors that defines our reality... but who's to say that is the only reality?

fa8fd0934c6fe34c260e84d96534f262aa	If you want to determine the amount of moisture in something, first you need to record the weight of the substance.  Then you need to drive the moisture out of the substance, usually with the use of an oven.  After a period of time, remove the substance and let it cool and then reweigh it.  Put it back in the oven and repeat the cooling & weighing until the weight has stabilized.  Once the weight is no longer dropping, record that as the final weight.    To find the percentage of moisture, subtract the final weight from the initial weight and then divide that number by the initial weight and multiply by 100 for the percentage.    If it is a vegetable that you want to analyze, it may be better to first chop it up into fine pieces to allow the moisture to escape from the inner parts.  Also, use care in selecting a temperature for the oven so that the material doesn't burn.  Burning will invalidate the results since you will then be looking at a combustion experiment.

b26c9fdc9194e1d86fd45a18f0617d69aa	Quando uma por??o de matria passa do estado slido para o lquido e, depois, para o gasoso, absorve calor e tem sua temperatura ampliada, pois, nesta seqncia, cada estado fsico da matria tem maior energia cintica do que o anterior. Cada transi??o de fase da gua requer muito mais calor do que transi??es equivalentes de outras substancias. Por exemplo, fundir 1 g de gua, a 0C, requer 334 Joules enquanto 1 g de etanol a -114C, 1 g de acetona a -95C ou 1 g de metanol a 182C requerem apenas cerca de 100 Joules. As temperaturas citadas s?o aquelas em as duas fases co-existem em equilbrio, sob press?o de 1 atmosfera, isto , s?o os pontos de fus?o normais destas substancias. Na vaporiza??o dos compostos nos seus pontos de ebuli??o normais, observa-se que 1 g de gua a 100C requer 2260 Joules enquanto que 1 g de etanol a 78C requer 945 J, 1 g de acetona a 56C requer 500 J e 1 g de metanol a 64C requer 930 J. Alis, a combina??o de elevados valores de calor especfico e de calor de vaporiza??o faz com que ela apague o fogo.    Voc j havia pensado nisso, por que a gua apaga o fogo? O fogo consiste na rea??o de combust?o entre o oxignio do ar e o material que est queimando, isto , o combustvel. Os produtos desta rea??o s?o xidos, como a prpria gua e gs carb?nico. Esta rea??o n?o  espontanea e requer muito calor para ser iniciada e mantida. Uma vez iniciada, o calor gerado pela prpria rea??o a mantm. Se jogamos gua no fogo, grande parte do calor gerado na combust?o  absorvido por ela para aquecer e vaporizar. Falta, ent?o, calor para manter a rea??o e a queima  interrompida.    Esta substancia, t?o simples e abundante, teve papel decisivo nas caractersticas do Planeta Terra e no surgimento e evolu??o da vida. Entretanto, ns, que aprendemos a alterar intensamente o Planeta Terra para vivermos melhor, precisamos, agora, zelar pelo Planeta gua, para que ele continue sendo o Planeta Vida!

Se vc coloca gua em algo em combust?o estar for?ando o equilbrio para o lado dos reagentes (Lei de Le Chatelier - a??o das massas). como a energia para restaurar os produtos e o CO2 j escapou para a atmosfera, a rea??o simplesmente deixa de acontecer, portanto o fogo acaba! espero ter contibudo para sua dvida!|`|b26147d35490385e2cc7f8ccde549b10aa	Pra ser mais simples.....:  A gua abaixa a temperatura da superfcie q queima... e impede q ela entre em contato com o gs Oxignio... q eh o q "alimenta" o fogo!|`|5bec8092ea95f18cddc0f11fca4beac3aa	a gua inibe o contato do oxignio do ar com o material em combust?o.

Porm se o combustvel for lquido insolvel na gua e menos denso, a gua n?o apaga o fogo, por exemplo se voc tiver gasolina em combust?o, n?o adianta jogar gua, pois esses combustveis menos densos que a gua flutuam na mesma, permanecendo em contato com o oxignio e mantendo a combust?o.|`|89382273c5f313a93ac3d046e4f00b54aa	Nem todo fogo  apagado por gua.  por isso que existe p quimico, espuma quimica, etc. Porque imagine uma grande explos?o em uma fabrica de produtos quimicos, n?o poderiam apagar com gua, pois alguns produtos seria n reagentes.|`|306e0e9d3c2648ae75b3f6d805a4a5c0aa	Simples prq p/ ter fogo  necessrio calor e oxignio e a gua retira o calor.|`|6db77bddff613b3e252e42e84941ec3daa	As repostas acima s elucidam porque ela apaga, mas n?o porque a prpria gua n?o queima. Se vaporizarmos gua a 200o em uma atmosfera de oxignio, ainda assim ela n?o queimar. Est claro de que n?o  por falta de calor ou contato com o oxignio.  Combust?o (pegar fogo)  uma rea??o de oxida??o onde o material combustvel perde eltrons e  oxidado e o comburente (oxignio) ganha eltron, se transformando em gua. Esta rea??o s ocorre porque o potencial redutor do oxignio  maior do que o do combustvel, logo ele consegue arrancar eltrons do combustvel. O combustvel ent?o se trnasforma em CO2 e o oxignio se transforma em gua (H2O). Imagina agora uma rea??o onde o oxignio ir queimar a gua, ou seja, arrancar eltrons dela. Se a gua perder os eltrons, se trnasformar em O2, enquento o O2, ganhando eltrons se transforma em H2O. Dest forma a rea??o seria:  H2O + O2  O2 + H2O. Ou seja tento faz um lado como o outro. A gua n?o pega fogo pois o potencial redutor ser igual para as duas dire??es da rea??o, assim como os produtos e reagentes. Isso significa dizer que n?o h rea??o, ou seja, a gua n?o queima.  O fato de ser formado por oxignio e hidrognio  explicado porque o primeiro  altamente oxidante e o segundo  altamente redutor, logo, eles se estabilizam formando gua.

a5ea5670347bccd43eb1324b846aff51aa	Os alquimistas tentavam produzir em laboratrio a pedra filosofal (ou mercrio dos filsofos, entre muitos outros nomes) a partir de matria-prima mais grosseira. Com esta pedra seria possvel obter a transmuta??o dos metais e o Elixir da Longa Vida, que  capaz de prolongar a vida indefinidamente. O trabalho relacionado com a pedra filosofal era chamado por eles de "A Grande Obra".    As matrias-primas do processo alqumico s?o, entre outros, o orvalho, o sal, o mercrio e o enxofre. De um modo geral, o processo alqumico  descrito de forma velada usando-se uma complicada simbologia que inclui smbolos astrolgicos, animais e figuras enigmticas.    O orvalho  utilizado para umedecer ou banhar a matria-prima. O sal  o dissolvente universal. Os outros dois elementos, mercrio e enxofre s?o as principais matrias-primas da alquimia. O enxofre  o princpio fixo, ativo, masculino, que representa as propriedades de combust?o e corros?o dos metais. O mercrio  o princpio voltil, passivo, feminino, inerte. Ambos, combinados, formam o que os alquimistas descrevem como o "coito do Rei e da Rainha".    O sal, tambm conhecido por arsnico,  o meio de liga??o entre o mercrio e o enxofre, muitas vezes associado  energia vital, que une corpo e alma.    A alquimia medieval acabou fundando, com seus estudos sobre os metais, as bases da qumica moderna. Diversas novas substancias foram descobertas pelos alquimistas, como o arsnico. Eles tambm deixaram como legado alguns procedimentos que usamos at hoje, como o famoso "banho-maria", devido a uma alquimista chamada Maria, a Judia. Ironia do destino, o desejo dos alquimistas de transmutar os metais tornou-se realidade nos nossos dias com a fiss?o e fus?o nuclear.|`|65c0760d3571c340f3da599574bd64a5aa	P?, vio.

A menina j nasce com cerca de 400 vulos e a partir desse perodo ela vai liberar um vulo por ms. E caso n?o seja fecundado ser expelido numa forma chamada menstrua??o.  O menino n?o nasce com os espermatozides, mas a partir desse perodo produz ininterruptamente durante s 24 horas. Acontece que em algum momento o organismo tambm ter que se livrar deles para acomodar as produ??es mais novas. E quando os mesmos n?o s?o utilizados, a ocorre o que se chama de Polu??o Noturna.  Essa  uma explica??o simples do metabolismo do aparelho reprodutor humano. Para maiores esclarecimentos consulte um Mdico urologista.      ) PSICOLOGIA  Em uma determinada vis?o psicanaltica, os sonhos acontecem como forma de exterioriza??o do que afetou o inconsciente. E esse recurso produz alvio ao aparelho psquico evitando que haja uma outra rea??o que pudesse danificar a sade .      A polu??o noturna pode acontecer sem o sonho?  Pode, desde que n?o exista gravado no inconsciente algo como uma imagem percebida anteriormente.  A Gestalt, outro seguimento da psicologia, diz que percebemos as coisa como ns somos e n?o como as coisas s?o. Talvez por isso que uma mesma tenta??o atrai uns e outros n?o.   O que j existe em sua mente sobre uma determinada tenta??o, vai determinar muito do quanto voc ter que lutar para vencer essa mesma tenta??o.  A receita para isso  manter-se com uma mente pura. Fil. 4:6-8.   meditar no Senhor e em Sua lei noite e dia. Sal. 1:2  Entende-se que um homem jovem e saudvel tem polu??o noturna pelo menos uma vez em cada 15 dias. E isso n?o precisa acontecer com sonhos erticos. 1o Cor. 10:13. Entretanto, h muitas formas de se estimular para que a mesma aconte?a com tais sonhos.   A Bblia diz que as mas conversa??es corrompem os bons costumes. 1oCor. 15:33; Efe. 5:4. Qualquer coisa (filmes, revistas, e etc.) que estimule pensamentos impuros vai criar um desconforto em fun??o de uma libido n?o   realizada. Para n?o pecar, o melhor  n?o pensar.

Ele foi obtido pelo aquecimento do grafite numa atmosfera inerte, sendo o C60 um composto do novo grupo dos aromticos, os fulerenos. Os fulerenos s?o molculas estruturadas na forma de gaiolas, ou seja, elas tm a forma fechada em si.   Estes compostos s?o obtidos tambm pela vaporiza??o do grafite por um feixe de laser. Os fulerenos, s?o constitudos por uma rede formada por pentgonos e hexgonos, fechando assim a esfera.

Esta descoberta marca o incio de uma nova rea do conhecimento:  a nanotecnologia.    A molcula tem uma estrutura semelhante a uma bola de futebol.   constituda por 60 tomos de carbono, que formam 12 pentgonos e 20 hexgonos.

Quando voc joga uma pedra para cima ela fica abaixo da velocidade de escape, portanto n?o consegue escapar da gravidade e ir para o espa?o.     O mesmo acontece com a lua. Como existe um certo equilbiro entre a sua velocidade e a gravidade da terra, ela tende a ficar em um meio ponto.      verdade que existe uma discreta tendncia de queda devido a desacelera??o da velocidade de rota??o, mas  t?o pequena que no momento imediato pode ser desprezada. Ou seja ela est caindo mas em um ritmo extremamente lento.    Ao contrrio do que foi afirmado em outras respostas, a for?a centrpeta  n?o  a causa da lua n?o cair. Ela  consequncia do equilbrio entre velocidade de rota??o e velocidade de escape.     O que a for?a centrpeta causa  o formato do movimento que  circular, t?o qual a brincadeira com a corda, gue e o balde. O que mantm o balde afastado de voc  o fato dele estar em movimento (velocidade de rota??o). Se fosse possvel gir-lo a uma velocidade extremanente grande a corde se romperia e o balde seguiria para fora (velocidade de escape). O que mantm a gua dentro do balde sem que ela derrame  a for?a centrpeta gerada pelo movimento circular.     Portanto a lua n?o cai devido ao relativo equilbrio entre a sua velocidade de rota??o e a velocidade de escape da gravidade da Terra.|`|f167f3c656ec63d611a4ae86f2619bd0aa	Sei!|`|4883a087320456218b163fd8ca841813aa	ja vi perguntas melhores, mais essa francamente..    tem o que perguntar n?o? mais td bem.. ela n?o cai porque a gravidade impede de cair.|`|f2c9a0d283709898d1bfe959cd474f26aa	Porque ela tem movimento de transla??o ao redor da Terra.

The interval between any two notes can be defined by the differences in their frequencies.  Higher frequencies produce higher pitches.    If you're vibrating a guitar string, and you want to create a higher pitch, you pinch off part of the string so that less of it can vibrate, which causes it to produce a higher pitch/frequency which is inversely proportional to the change in length of the string (half the string means double the frequence, which is a jump of one octave).|`|e9269e659f2d91b590eee19c8379b58baa	there's a black hole wayyyyy on the other side of the galaxy, and it emits sound waves as a B-flat 52 octaves below middle C.

Precisa-se da imagina??o que transcenda os fatos e reproduza a complexidade das atividades humanas como um filme explicativo, questionador, repleto de conceitos, propsitos e dvidas. Sobretudo porque a dvida  o elemento principal na composi??o do filme da histria. A dvida e n?o a descren?a. Mas trabalhos de ensino de Histria Africana aparecem inicialmente como uma sistemtica descren?a nas possibilidades civilizatrias. Acompanhando a descren?a um bloqueio  imagina??o.  O principal problema encontrado no processo de ensino e aprendizado da Histria Africana n?o  relativo  histria e  sua complexidade, mas  com rela??o aos preconceitos adquiridos num processo de informa??o desinformada sobre a frica.     Estas informa??es de carter racistas, produtoras de um imaginrio pobre e preconceituoso, brutalmente erradas, extremamente alienantes e fortemente restritivas. Seu efeito  t?o forte que as pessoas quando colocadas em frente a uma nova informa??o sobre a frica tem dificuldade em articular novos raciocnios sobre a histria deste continente, sobretudo de imaginar diferente do raciocnio habitual.    A imagem do Africano na nossa sociedade  a do selvagem acorrentado  misria. Imagem construda pela insistncia e persistncia das representa??es africanas como a terra dos macacos, dos le?es, dos homens nus e dos escravos.    Quanto aos povos asiticos e europeus as platias imaginam, castelos, guerreiros e contextos histricos diversos. Quanto  Histria Africana s imaginam selva, selva, selva, deserto, deserto e tribos selvagens perdidas nas selvas.  H um bloqueio sistemtico em pensar diferente das caricaturas presentes no imaginrio social brasileiro.  As informa??es novas geram uma constante desconfian?a, tendo ocorrido mais de uma vez a pergunta, se eram sobre a frica aquelas informa??es. Quando se desenvolvem tpicos sobre a indstria txtil africana e as exporta??es de tecido para a Europa no passado, ou mesmo a informa??o de que a frica precedeu a Europa no uso de roupas, h uma inquieta??o, um conflito emocional onde a dvida  persistente.    O elemento bsico para Introdu??o  Histria Africana n?o est na histria africana e sim na desconstru??o e elimina??o de alguns elementos bsicos das ideologias racistas brasileiras.  O cotidiano brasileiro  povoado de smbolos de ****** selvagens e escravos amarrados, que processam e administram o escravismo mental e realizam a tarefa de feitores invisveis a chicotear a menor rebeldia o imaginar diferente.  Acredito serem cinco os pontos importantes a serem desconstrudos na imagina??o dos brasileiros sobre a frica.    1. A frica n?o  uma selva tropical.  2. A frica n?o  mais distante que os outros continentes.  3. As popula??es Africanas n?o s?o isoladas e perdidos na selva.  4. O europeu n?o chegou um dia na frica trazendo civiliza??o.  5. A frica tem histria e tambm tinha escrita.    Existem outros tpicos, apenas estou citando os cincos mais persistentes, os outros v?o no sentido de "burrice do africano". O africano  tido sempre como o diferente com rela??o aos povos de outros continentes. Os iguais s?o os europeus e os asiticos. Diferente no sentido n?o da diversidade humana, mas de uma hierarquia de valores, onde, uns s?o certos e os outros errados. Os iguais s?o certos e os diferentes errados, estes s?o os contedos das idias que est?o no subconsciente que instrui os raciocnios. Nos cursos seguidamente aparecem frase tais como: "o que destri a frica  que eles brigam muito entre si". "Eles n?o s?o unidos como os europeus". Ou ent?o surge a pergunta "de onde vem o *****", com nfase numa possvel origem biolgica diferente do branco quanto s possibilidades intelectuais.    Muitas vezes, precedendo uma exposi??o sobre a Histria Africana utiliza-se o recurso de apresentar cart?es postais sobre Abdjan, Dakar, Cidade do Cabo, Lagos e outras capitais africanas informalmente. Quanto a quest?o se s?o cidades africanas as express?es incrdulas n?o escondem um pequeno espanto. Alguns retomam as fotos.  A mesmo exerccio tambm pode ser realizado com fotos de vesturios e de mercados africanos, onde aparece uma diversidade de trajes femininos e masculinos.  A terceira surpresa ocorre quando da apresenta??o de uma gravura do Rei Monomotapa de 1531. Rei e Rainhas s?o do universo do imaginrio sobre a Europa e n?o abrange a frica. Faces da admira??o abre ensejo para discuss?o sobre os conceitos e preconceitos em rela??o s civiliza??es africanas. A existncia de um rei implica uma organiza??o social, um territrio, uma na??o e, atravs da discuss?o destes desdobramentos facilita uma desconstru??o dos esteretipos da frica Selvagem.  As florestas africanas perfazem apenas 1/8 do territrio continental. S?o necessrias a introdu??o de informa??es geogrficas para terem a idia da possibilidade de existncia de vida organizada, cidades com infra-estruturas urbanas desenvolvidas no passado africano.  A percep??o err?nea de que a frica tem apenas paisagens de florestas tropicais leva a imaginar o africano sempre vivendo em choupanas na floresta. N?o sobra lugar para cidades imensas ou para planta??es, atividades econ?micas, agrcolas e pecurias.  Uma vez que a imagem africana  construda tambm pelo cinema,  preciso avisar aos incautos que muito dos filmes do gnero Tarzan s?o rodados nos Estados Unidos em cenrios da Flrida.  Em contribui??o a imagens construdas de impossibilidades civilizatrias africanas, estas est?o sempre ao lado das florestas tropicais e do deserto, tambm tido como estril e inabitvel. Alm disto, o deserto  ma

Pois  por isso que estudamos os modelos atomicos! desde Leucipo at os dias atuais!    Abaixo est uma cronologia dos principais fatos ocorridos:    450 a.C. - Leucipo   A matria pode se dividir em partculas cada vez menores.     400 a.C. - Demcrito   Denomina??o tomo para a menor partcula de matria. Considerado o pai do atomismo grego.     60 a.C. - Lucrcio   Autor do poema De Rerum Natura, atravs do qual foi consolidado o atomismo de Demcrito.     1661 - Boyle   Autor do livro Sceptical chemist, no qual defendeu o atomismo e deu o primeiro conceito de elemento com base experimental.     1808 - Dalton   Primeiro modelo at?mico com base experimental. O tomo  uma partcula maci?a e indivisvel. O modelo vingou at 1897.     1834 - Faraday   Estudo quantitativo de eletrlise, atravs do qual surgiu a idia da eletricidade associada aos tomos.     1859   Primeiras experincias de descargas eltricas em gases a press?o reduzida (ao redor de 10 mmHg). Descoberta dos "raios" posteriormente chamados catdicos.     1874 - Stoney   Admitiu que a eletricidade estava associada aos tomos em quantidades discretas. Primeira idia de quantiza??o da carga eltrica.     1879 - Crookes   Primeiras experincias de descarga eltrica a alto vcuo. Raios catdicos.     1886 - Goldstein   Descargas eltricas em gases a press?o reduzida com ctodo perfurado. Descoberta dos raios canais ou positivos.     1891 - Stoney   Deu o nome de eltron para a unidade de carga eltrica negativa.     1895 - R?entgen   Descoberta dos raios X.     1896 - Becquerel   Descoberta da radioatividade.     1897 - Thomson   Descargas eltricas em alto vcuo (tubos de Crookes) levaram  descoberta do eltron. O tomo seria uma partcula maci?a, mas n?o indivisvel. Seria formado por uma gelia com carga positiva, na qual estariam incrustados os eltrons (modelo do pudim de ameixas). Determina??o da rela??o carga/massa (e/m) do eltron.     1898 - Casal Curie   Descoberta do pol?nio e do rdio.     1900 - Max Planck   Teoria Quantica.     1905 - Einstein   Teoria da relatividade. Rela??o entre massa e energia (e = mc2). Esclarecimento do efeito fotoeltrico. Denomina??o fton para o quantum de energia radiante.     1909 - Millikan   Determina??o da carga do eltron.     1911 - Rutherford   O tomo n?o  maci?o nem indivisvel. O tomo seria formado por um ncleo muito pequeno, com carga positiva, onde estaria concentrada praticamente toda a sua massa. Ao redor do ncleo ficariam os eltrons, neutralizando sua carga. Este  o modelo do tomo nucleado, um modelo que foi comparado ao sistema planetrio, onde o Sol seria o ncleo e os planetas seriam os eltrons.     1913 - Bohr   Modelo at?mico fundamentado na teoria dos quanta e sustentado experimentalmente com base na espectroscopia. Distribui??o eletr?nica em nveis de energia. Quando um eltron do tomo recebe energia, ele salta para outro nvel de maior energia, portanto mais distante do ncleo. Quando o eltron volta para o seu nvel de energia primitivo (mais prximo do ncleo), ele cede a energia anteriormente recebida sob forma de uma onda eletromagntica (luz).     1916 - Sommerfeld   Modelo das rbitas elpticas para o eltron. Introdu??o dos subnveis de energia.     1920 - Rutherford   Caracteriza??o do prton como sendo o ncleo do tomo de hidrognio e a unidade de carga positiva. Previs?o de existncia do nutron.     1924 - De Broglie   Modelo da partcula-onda para o eltron.     1926 - Heisenberg   Princpio da incerteza.     1927 - Schr?dinger   Equa??o de fun??o de onda para o eltron.     1932 - Chadwick   Descoberta do nutron.|`|bb4734254490e70ec750d4028709f689aa	Modelos at?micos, conjuntos de hipteses sobre a estrutura e o comportamento do tomo.    A teoria at?mica moderna come?a com John Dalton ao observar, em 1803, que os elementos qumicos ligam-se em propor??es bem definidas e deste fato concluir que o elemento qumico  uma partcula maci?a indivisvel e eletricamente neutra. Vrias experincias, porm, sugeriam que a neutralidade da matria poderia ser rompida. Por exemplo, a matria podia ser eletrizada por atrito. Em 1903, Joseph John Thomson sugeriu um modelo, o pudim de ameixas de Thomson, em que o tomo era concebido como uma esfera de carga positiva (o pudim) dentro da qual encontravam-se pequenos ncleos de carga negativa (as ameixas). A carga eltrica total do pudim era nula. Este modelo n?o resistiu s experincias. Em 1911, Ernest Rutherford realizou um experimento que o levou a sugerir que o tomo de um elemento  constitudo por cargas negativas, os eltrons, que orbitam em torno de um ncleo positivamente carregado, um modelo similar ao Sistema Solar. Esse modelo, aperfei?oado por Niels Bohr,  conhecido como modelo de Rutherford-Bohr. Posteriormente, o modelo de Rutherford-Bohr foi substitudo pela moderna teoria quantica do tomo, em que o eltron ligado ao ncleo positivo  descrito por uma nuvem de probabilidade, o orbital.

Ningum sabe, pois ningum ainda foi capaz de faz-lo. Embora o carbono tenha o status de ser o "elemento da vida", seu estado lquido ainda  um mistrio. Agora, cientistas do Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory predizem que o carbono tem dois, e n?o apenas um, estados lquidos.   Isto n?o deveria ser uma surpresa, tendo em vista que, no estado slido, o carbono tambm tem duas formas: diamante e grafite. A diferen?a fundamental entre os dois estados slidos  a maneira como os tomos de carbonos est?o ligados entre si. No estado lquido, segundo os cientistas, isto tambm acontece.     O problema em se observar o estado lquido do carbono  que este elemento funde somente a temperaturas extremamente altas, em torno de 4.500 graus celsius!      No exemplar de 7 de junho/99 do jornal Physical Review Letters, James Glosli e Francis Ree publicaram um artigo contendo simula??es computacionais do estado lquido do carbono, predizendo dois tipos de carbono lquido: um muito mais denso do que o outro. O lquido mais denso, existente em altas press?es e temperaturas,  como um diamante derretido - a maioria dos tomos ainda contm 4 vizinhos e organiza-se regularmente. A forma menos densa, entretanto, n?o tem nada similar ao grafite - os tomos ficam ligados sobre a forma de cadeias, como se fosse um grande spaghetti carb?nico.       isso ai Thalita, visite o site abaixo,  muito interessante, espero que goste.

Mas para conseguir isso  necessrio um ambiente sem oxignio, pois o diamante  carbono puro, e na presen?a do oxignio torna-se gs carb?nico (CO2).

e9eed448c77e100280e4c3add6929ab2aa	Jackson, segue abaixo algumas informa??es sobre taxas de juros, extraidas do site www.somatematica.com.br, s?o bem interessantes, vale a pena conferir.        bastante antigo o conceito de juros, tendo sido amplamente divulgado e utilizado ao longo da Histria. Esse conceito surgiu naturalmente quando o Homem percebeu existir uma estreita rela??o entre o dinheiro e o tempo. Processos de acumula??o de capital e a desvaloriza??o da moeda levariam normalmente a idia de juros, pois se realizavam basicamente devido ao valor temporal do dinheiro.          As tbuas mais antigas mostram um alto grau de habilidade computacional e deixam claro que o sistema sexagesimal posicional j estava de longa data estabelecida. H muitos textos desses primeiros tempos que tratam da distribui??o de produtos agrcolas e de clculos aritmticos baseados nessas transa??es. As tbuas mostram que os sumrios antigos estavam familiarizados com todos os tipos de contratos legais e usuais, como faturas, recibos, notas promissrias, crdito, juros simples e compostos, hipotecas, escrituras de venda e endossos.          H tbuas que s?o documentos de empresas comerciais e outras que lidam com sistemas de pesos e medidas. Muitos processos aritmticos eram efetuados com a ajuda de vrias tbuas.Das 400 tbuas matemticas cerca de metade eram tbuas matemticas. Estas ltimas envolvem tbuas de multiplica??o, tbuas de inversos multiplicativos, tbuas de quadrados e cubos e mesmo tbuas de exponenciais. Quanto a estas, provavelmente eram usadas, juntamente com a interpela??o, em problemas de juros compostos. As tbuas de inversos eram usadas para reduzir a divis?o  multiplica??o.               II-) Os Juros e os Impostos          Os juros e os impostos existem desde a poca dos primeiros registros de civiliza??es existentes na Terra. Um dos primeiros indcios apareceu na j na Babil?nia no ano de 2000 aC. Nas cita??es mais antigas, os juros eram pagos pelo uso de sementes ou de outras convenincias emprestadas; os juros eram pagos sob a forma de sementes ou de outros bens. Muitas das prticas existentes originaram-se dos antigos costumes de emprstimo e devolu??o de sementes e de outros produtos agrcolas.          A Histria tambm revela que a idia se tinha tornado t?o bem estabelecida que j existia uma firma de banqueiros internacionais em 575 aC, com os escritrios centrais na Babil?nia. Sua renda era proveniente das altas taxas de juros cobradas pelo uso de seu dinheiro para o financiamento do comrcio internacional. O juro n?o  apenas uma das nossas mais antigas aplica??es da Matemtica Financeira e Economia, mas tambm seus usos sofreram poucas mudan?as atravs dos tempos.          Como em todas as instru??es que tem existido por milhares de anos, algumas das prticas relativas a juros tem sido modificadas para satisfazerem s exigncias atuais, mas alguns dos antigos costumes ainda persistem de tal modo que o seu uso nos dias atuais ainda envolve alguns procedimentos inc?modos. Entretanto, devemos lembrar que todas as antigas prticas que ainda persistem foram inteiramente lgicas no tempo de sua origem. Por exemplo, quando as sementes eram emprestadas para a semeadura de uma certa rea, era lgico esperar o pagamento na prxima colheita - no prazo de um ano. Assim, o clculo de juros numa base anual era mais razovel; t?o quanto o estabelecimento de juros compostos para o financiamento das antigas viagens comerciais, que n?o poderiam ser concludas em um ano.Conforme a necessidade de cada poca, foi se criando novas formas de se trabalhar com a rela??o tempo-juros (juros semestral, bimestral, dirio, etc).          H tbuas nas cole??es de Berlirn, de Yale e do Louvre que contm problemas sobre juros compostos e h algumas tbuas em Istambul que parecem ter sido original- mente tbuas de a' para n de 1 a 10 e para a = 9, 16, 100 e 225. Com essas tbuas podem-se resolver equa??es exponenciais do tipo a' = b.        isso ai Jackson, entra no site, que tem muita informa??o, espero que goste.

Se no processo de sele??o natural que envolve todos os animais do mundo, o ovo, genericamente falando, tenha surgido antes da atual galinha, ent?o fiquemos com a resposta OVO.    Mas se a galinha surgiu e s depois desenvolveu a tcnica reprodutiva do ovo, ent?o a resposta bvia  GALINHA.    Como sabemos, cientificamente, que a espcie atual de galinha descende de animais que j produziam ovos, A RESPOSTA CORRETA  OVO.|`|8c36e6803b32ac6943ffed8cf630bfceaa	Cientista, filsofo e avicultor dizem quem nasceu primeiro: o ovo ou a galinha?  Um cientista, um filsofo e um avicultor acreditam ter descoberto a resposta para uma das perguntas mais intrigantes da humanidade: quem nasceu primeiro, o ovo ou a galinha? A resposta dada pelos pensadores e pelos granjeiros  que o ovo veio antes, de acordo com uma reportagem publicada, nesta sexta-feira, no "The Times". O argumento  que o material gentico n?o se transforma durante a vida do animal, mas que, a primeira ave que se transformou no que chamamos hoje de uma galinha, existiu primeiro como embri?o no interior de um ovo.    O professor John Brookfield, especialista de gentica da evolu??o da Universidade de Nottigham, na Inglaterra, disse que a quest?o estava resolvida para ele.O organismo vivo no interior do ovo teria o mesmo DNA do que o animal que, logo, se transformaria na "primeira coisa viva que podemos classificar, sem medo, de membro dessa espcie  o primeiro ovo".    Para David Papineau, especialista em filosofia da Cincia do King's College, em Londres, se o primeiro pintinho saiu de um ovo  um erro pensar que, o ovo que gerou a galinha, produzido por pais de outra espcie, sofreu muta??o.    - Se tem um pintinho dentro, o ovo  de galinha. Se um canguru colocasse ovo, e do ovo sasse um avestruz, o ovo seria de avestruz, n?o de canguru - disse Papineau.    A reportagem ouviu ainda o avicultor e presidente de um organismo do setor de aves, que tambm contribuiu para o debate, Charles Bourns.    - Os ovos existiam antes mesmo de nascer o primeiro pintinho. Claro que talvez n?o tivessem o aspecto que tm hoje - disse.

Quando a luz do sol incide sobre a atmosfera, a luz se choca com as partculas do ar e as diferentes ondas de luz se propagam de diferentes maneiras. As ondas de menor comprimento se espalham mais e mais rapidamente que as de maior comprimento. A luz azul  uma das que tem menor comprimento, sendo maior apenas que a luz violeta. Porm, a luz violeta existe em quantidade muito menor que a azul na luz solar.

The current, or amperage, is dependent on th resistance of the load, and the voltage applied.    Parallel:  For DC, voltage is divided among individual branches to ground.  If you apply 10v to a circuit with two paths to ground, the voltage is 5v per branch.  For AC, the voltage remains consistant for each branch. 10v applied to two branches to gound will measure 10v on each branch.    Series:  For DC, the same voltage is applied to each resistor, but the amperage decreases down the line.

529664d95fb8efa5a686198e5d27732faa	A resposta est em como os raios solares interagem com a atmosfera. Quando a luz passa atravs de um prisma, o espectro  quebrado num arco-ris de cores. Nossa atmosfera faz o mesmo papel, atuando como uma espcie de prisma onde os raios solares colidem com as molculas e s?o responsveis pelo dispers?o do azul.    Quando olhamos a cor de algo,  porque este "algo" refletiu ou dispersou a luz de uma determinada cor associada a um comprimento de onda. Uma folha verde utiliza todas as cores para fazer a fotossntese, menos o verde, porque esta foi refletida. Devido ao seu pequeno tamanho e estrutura, as minsculas molculas da atmosfera difundem melhor as ondas com pequenos comprimentos de onda, tais como o azul e violeta. As molculas est?o espalhadas atravs de toda a atmosfera, de modo que a luz azul dispersada chega aos nossos olhos com facilidade. Luz azul  dispersada dez vezes mais que luz vermelha.    A luz azul tem uma frequncia ( ciclos de onda por segundo ) que  muito prximo da frequncia de ressonancia dos tomos, ao contrrio da luz vermelha. Logo a luz azul movimenta os eltrons nas camadas at?micas da molcula com muito mais facilidade que a vermelha. Isso provoca um ligeiro atraso na luz azul que  re-emitida em todas as dire??es num processo chamado dispers?o de Rayleigh ( Fsico ingls do sculo 19 ). A luz vermelha, que n?o  dispersada e sim transmitida, continua em sua dire??o original, mas quando olhamos para o cu  a luz azul que vemos porque  a que foi mais dispersada pelas molculas em todas as dire??es. Luz violeta tem comprimento de onda menor que luz azul, portanto dispersa-se mais na atmosfera que o azul. Por que ent?o n?o vemos o cu violeta ? Porque n?o h suficiente luz violeta. O Sol produz muito mais luz azul que violeta. Quando o cu est com cerra??o, nvoa ou polui??o, h partculas de tamanho grande que dispersam igualmente todos os comprimentos de onda, logo o cu tende ao branco pela mistura de cores. Isso  mais comum na linha do horizonte.     No vcuo do espa?o extraterrestre, onde n?o h atmosfera, os raios do Sol n?o s?o dispersos, logo eles percorrem uma linha reta do Sol at o observador. Devido a isso os astronautas vem um cu *****. Em Jpiter o cu tambm  azul porque ocorre o mesmo tipo de dispers?o do azul na atmosfera do planeta como na Terra. Porm em Marte o cu  cor de rosa, ja que h excessivas partculas de poeira na atmosfera marciana devido  presen?a de xidos de ferro originrios do solo. Se a atmosfera de Marte fosse limpa da poeira, ela seria azul, porm um azul mais escuro j que a atmosfera de Marte  muito mais rarefeita.     Por que o p?r do sol e a alvorada s?o vermelhos ?  Quando o Sol est no horizonte, a luz leva um caminho muito maior atravs da atmosfera para chegar aos nossos olhos do que quando est sobre nossas cabe?as. A luz azul nesse caminho foi toda dispersada, a atmosfera atua como um filtro e muito pouca luz azul chega at voc, enquanto que a luz vermelha que n?o  dispersada e sim transmitida alcan?a nossos olhos com facilidade. Nessa hora a luz branca est sem o azul.    Durante a dispers?o da luz nas molculas ocorre o fen?meno de interferncia destrutiva em que a onda principal se subdivide em vrias outras de menor intensidade e em todas dire??es, porm mantendo a energia total conservada. O efeito disto  que a luz azul do Sol que vinha em linha reta passa a ir em todas as dire??es. Ao meio dia todas as dire??es est?o prximas de ns mas no entardecer a dispers?o leva para longe do nosso campo de vis?o o azul j que a luz solar percorre uma longa tangente na circunferncia da terra at chegar aos nossos olhos.     Alm disso, o vermelho e o laranja tornam-se muito mais vvidos no crepsculo quando h poeira ou fuma?a no ar, provocado por incndios, tempestade de poeira e vulc?es. Isso ocorre porque essas partculas maiores tambm provocam dispers?o com a luz de comprimento de onda prximos, no caso o vermelho e laranja.    Por que as nuvens s?o brancas ?  NNas nuvens existem partculas (gotas de gua) de tamanhos muito maiores que o comprimento de onda da luz ocorrendo dispers?o generalizada em todo o espectro visvel e iguais quantidades de azul, verde e vermelho se juntam formando o branco.|`|116b811bd494ea3c22183d3d699aa47faa	 por causa da fundura do cu,ou,  fundo de mais....................|`|265480994e71fd77a1c03eb8ad4c40d2aa	A cor azul do cu  provocada pelo efeito da luz do sol cruzando a atmosfera e as partculas em suspen??o no ar.

A cor do cu depende da composi??o da atmosfera que interage com a luz solar que chega  Terra. Essa intera??o  o resultado do fen?meno luminoso chamado dispers?o que ser estudado neste artigo.    A resposta est em como os raios solares interagem com a atmosfera. Quando a luz passa atravs de um prisma, um espectro  formado num arco-ris de cores. Nossa atmosfera faz o mesmo papel, atuando como uma espcie de prisma onde os raios solares colidem com as molculas e s?o responsveis pela dispers?o do azul. Quando olhamos a cor de algo,  porque este "algo" refletiu ou dispersou a luz de uma determinada cor associada a um comprimento de onda. Uma folha verde utiliza todas as cores para fazer a fotossntese, menos o verde, porque esta foi refletida. Devido a sua estrutura, as minsculas molculas dos gases componentes da atmosfera difundem melhor as ondas com pequenos comprimentos de onda, tais como azul e violeta. As molculas est?o espalhadas atravs de toda a atmosfera, de modo que a luz azul dispersada chega aos nossos olhos com facilidade.   A luz azul  dispersa dez vezes mais que a luz vermelha.  A luz azul tem uma freqncia (ciclos de onda por segundo) que  muito prxima da freqncia de ressonancia dos tomos, ao contrrio da luz vermelha. Logo, a luz azul movimenta os eltrons nas camadas at?micas da molcula com muito mais facilidade que a vermelha. Isso provoca um ligeiro atraso na luz azul que  re-emitida em todas as dire??es num processo chamado dispers?o de Rayleigh (Fsico ingls do sculo 19). A luz vermelha, que n?o  dispersa e sim transmitida, continua em sua dire??o original, mas quando olhamos para o cu  a luz azul que vemos, porque  a que foi mais dispersada pelas molculas em todas as dire??es.  Luz violeta tem comprimento de onda menor que luz azul, portanto dispersa-se mais na atmosfera que o azul. Porque ent?o, n?o vemos o cu violeta? Porque n?o h suficiente luz ultravioleta. O Sol produz muito mais luz azul que violeta. Quando o cu est com cerra??o, nvoa ou polui??o, h partculas de tamanho grande que dispersam igualmente todos os comprimentos de ondas, logo o cu tende ao branco pela mistura de cores. Isso  mais comum na linha do horizonte. No vcuo do espa?o, onde n?o h atmosfera, os raios do Sol n?o s?o dispersos, logo eles percorrem uma linha reta do Sol at o observador. Devido a isso os astronautas vem um cu *****. Em Jpiter o cu tambm  azul porque ocorre o mesmo tipo de dispers?o do azul na atmosfera do planeta como na Terra.

b64401146bd447a620013bf3400fd8ddaa	N?o h como fazer isso que voc propoe.  A fus?o nuclear libera uma quantidade enorme de energia e, na  terra, n?o dispomos de tecnologia para control-la. Veja o caso de usinas at?micas e bombas at?micas que utilizam o processo de fiss?o nuclear. O primeiro caso, o da usina, o processo  controlado mas qualquer vazamento causa um desastre de grandes propor??es, veja a histria de Chernobil. No segundo caso o processo n?o  controlado e voc deve saber qual o tamanho da energia liberada durante a explos?o.  O caso mais prximo que dispomos de fus?o nuclear  o Sol. As estrelas tem massa suficiente para processar a fus?o mas liberam para o espa?o uma quantidade estpida de energia. Mesmo em estrelas, sejam elas de qualquer grandeza, que vai de 1a at 5a ( o nosso sol e de 5a - ou seja, pequena estrela) o processo de fus?o se inicia nos elementos mais abundantes do universo - Hidrognio e Hlio - e acaba no ferro. Quando uma estrela produz todo o ferro que pode produzir ela se torna instvel e explode, o que a torna na chamada Super Nova, e a sim, com a energia absoluta de sua explos?o, todos os outros elementos da tabela peridica s?o "feitos" e sempre em quantidades cade vez menores quando v?o se aproximando do final da tabela, pois requerem muita energia na fus?o, o que os torna raros e valiosos.

Este atomo tem um numero atomico t?o grande que apos um certo periodo ele se transforma em chumbo ( a meia vida). se todos os elementos estivessem unidos formando um unico atomo, teriamos uma BOMBA extremamente violenta, de energia incalculavel, inimaginavel...

As paredes de uma estufa impedem que grande parte do calor produzido em seu interior abandone este espa?o.    As substancias gasosas poluentes que tm se acumulado na atmosfera nas ltimas dcadas fazem exatamente isto. O calor que acompanha os raios solares, quando incidem sobre a superfcie da Terra, aquecem a crosta terrestre. Aquecida pelo Sol, a crosta terrestre come?a a irradiar parte do calor recebido de volta para o espa?o em forma de raios infravermelhos. Havendo equilbrio entre o calor absorvido do Sol e o calor re-irradiado para o espa?o, a temperatura da crosta terrestre ficaria estabilizada.    Ocorre que ao gases poluentes presentes na atmosfera n?o deixam o calor re-irradiado pela crosta terrestre se dispersarem para o espa?o. Ele fica confinado na atmosfera. Resultado? Aquecimento excessivo da mesma, exatamente como numa estufa. Por isso este "mecanismo" de aquecimento global  chamado de Efeito Estufa.|`|f167f3c656ec63d611a4ae86f2619bd0aa	Olha s, existem gases que absorvem bem o calor (geralmente os gases s?o bons nisso!) como o CO2, produzido pela combust?o e polui nosso ar (entre outros gases poluidores).

Isto deve-se principalmente ao efeito sobre os raios infravermelhos de gases como o Dixido de Carbono, Metano, xidos de Azoto e Oz?nio presentes na atmosfera (totalizando menos de 1% desta), que v?o reter esta radia??o na Terra, permitindo-nos assistir ao efeito calorfico dos mesmos.     Nos ltimos anos, a concentra??o de dixido de carbono na atmosfera tem aumentado cerca de 0,4% anualmente; este aumento se deve  utiliza??o de petrleo, gs e carv?o e  destrui??o das florestas tropicais. A concentra??o de outros gases que contribuem para o Efeito de Estufa, tais como o metano e os clorofluorcarbonetos tambm aumentaram rapidamente. O efeito conjunto de tais substancias pode vir a causar um aumento da temperatura global (Aquecimento Global) estimado entre 2 e 6 oC nos prximos 100 anos. Um aquecimento desta ordem de grandeza n?o s ir alterar os climas em nvel mundial como tambm ir aumentar o nvel mdio das guas do mar em, pelo menos, 30 cm, o que poder interferir na vida de milh?es de pessoas habitando as reas costeiras mais baixas.   Se a terra n?o fosse coberta por um manto de ar, a atmosfera, seria demasiado fria para a vida. As condi??es seriam hostis  vida, a qual de t?o frgil que , bastaria uma pequena diferen?a nas condi??es iniciais da sua forma??o, para que ns n?o pudessemos estar aqui discutindo-a.     O Efeito Estufa consiste, basicamente, na a??o   do dixido de carbono e outros gases sobre os raios infravermelhos refletidos pela superfcie da terra, reenviando-os para ela, mantendo assim uma temperatura estvel no planeta. Ao irradiarem a Terra, parte dos raios luminosos oriundos do Sol s?o absorvidos e transformados em calor, outros s?o refletidos para o espa?o, mas s parte destes chega a deixar a Terra, em consequncia da a??o refletora que os chamados "Gases de Efeito Estufa" (dixido de carbono, metano, clorofluorcarbonetos- CFCs- e xidos de azoto) tm sobre tal radia??o reenviando-a para a superfcie terrestre na forma de raios infravermelhos.     Desde a poca pr-histrica que o dixido de carbono tem tido um papel determinante na regula??o da temperatura global do planeta. Com o aumento da utiliza??o de combustveis fsseis (Carv?o, Petrleo e Gs Natural) a concentra??o de dixido de carbono na atmosfera duplicou nos ltimos cem anos.

O efeito estufa dentro de uma determinada faixa pode ser considerado como uma coisa boa, pois, sem ele a vida, como a conhecemos, n?o poderia existir. O que se pode tornar catastrfico  um aumento do efeito estufa que desestabilize o equilbrio energtico no planeta e origine o aquecimento global do planeta.    Os gases ?de estufa? (vapor de gua, dixido de carbono, ozono, CFCs) absorvem alguma da radia??o infravermelha emitida pela superfcie da Terra e radiam por sua vez alguma da energia absorvida de volta para a superfcie. Como resultado, a superfcie recebe quase o dobro de energia da atmosfera do que a que recebe do Sol e a superfcie fica cerca de 30oC mais quente do que estaria sem a presen?a dos gases ?de estufa?.    O nome ?efeito estufa?  um nome infeliz porque a atmosfera n?o se comporta como uma estufa (ou como um cobertor). Numa estufa, o aquecimento d-se essencialmente porque a convec??o  suprimida. N?o h troca de ar entre o interior e o exterior. Ora acontece que a atmosfera facilita a convec??o e n?o armazena calor: em mdia, a temperatura da atmosfera  constante e a energia absorvida transforma-se imediatamente na energia cintica e potencial das molculas que existem na atmosfera. A atmosfera n?o reflete a energia radiada pela Terra. Os seus gases, principalmente o dixido de carbono, absorvem-na. E se radia,  apenas porque tem uma temperatura finita e n?o por ter recebido radia??o. A radia??o que emite nada tem que ver com a que foi absorvida. Tem um espectro completamente diferente.      O aumento do efeito estufa, como quase todos os assuntos, cientficos ou n?o, que a humanidade trata, apresenta mltiplas facetas. De uma forma ou de outra, a organiza??o da sociedade ou Poltica  a for?a definidora da verdade, ou pelo menos a verdade presente.    O problema do efeito estufa e sua pretensa influncia no aquecimento global acelerado dos ltimos 100 anos p?em em confronto for?as sociais poderosas que n?o permitem que se trate deste assunto do ponto de vista estritamente cientfico. Alinham-se, de um lado, os defensores das causas antropognicas como principais responsveis pelo aquecimento acelerado do planeta. S?o a maioria e omnipresentes na mdia. Do outro lado est?o os "cticos", que afirmam que o aquecimento acelerado est muito mais relacionado com causas externas  Terra do que com as reclamadas desmatamento e polui??o que mais rapido causam os efeitos indesejveis a vida sobre a face terrestre do que propriamente a capacidade de reposi??o planetria.    Ambos os lados apresentam argumentos poderosos e s?o apoiados por for?as sociais tambm poderosas. Recomenda-se, embora o efeito estufa seja reconhecido por ambas as fac??es, que se tenha cautela na anlise dos argumentos apresentados pelos dois lados.    A polui??o dos ltimos duzentos anos tornou mais espessa a camada de gases existentes na atmosfera. Essa camada impede a dispers?o da energia luminosa proveniente do Sol, que aquece e ilumina a Terra, e tambm retm a radia??o infravermelha (calor) emitida pela superfcie do planeta. O efeito do espessamento da camada gasosa  semelhante ao de uma estufa de vidro para plantas, o que originou seu nome. Muitos desses gases s?o produzidos naturalmente, como resultado de erup??es vulcanicas, da decomposi??o de matria organica e da fuma?a de grandes incndios. Sua existncia  indispensvel para a existncia de vida no planeta, mas a densidade atual da camada gasosa  devida, em grande medida,  atividade humana. Em escala global, o efeito estufa provoca o aquecimento do clima, o que tem conseqncias catastrficas. O derretimento das calotas polares e de geleiras, por exemplo, eleva o nvel das guas dos oceanos e dos lagos, submergindo ilhas e amplas reas litoraneas densamente povoadas. O superaquecimento das regi?es tropicais e subtropicais contribui para intensificar o processo de desertifica??o e de prolifera??o de insetos nocivos  sade humana e animal. A destrui??o de habitats naturais provoca o desaparecimento de espcies vegetais e animais. Multiplicam-se as secas, inunda??es e furac?es, com sua seqela de destrui??o e morte.

f63937af92c89ef0157cec794438d0a0aa	A haloalkane is an alkane (C-H chain with only single bonds) with a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, I) attached to it. For it to be primary, it must be attached to a carbon which is also only attached to hydrgens.     So, a primary haloalkane would be a saturated (no double bonds) carbon chain with a halogen attached to a carbon which is only attached to one R group (something other an a hydrogen, like another carbon or a nitrogen or an oxygen, whatever). A secondary haloalkane would be a saturated carbon chain with a halogen attached to a secondary carbon (a carbon with two R groups), and a tertiary haloalkane has a halogen attached to a tertiary carbon (a carbon bonded to 4 R groups, and therefore with no hydrogens)    i hope that made sense.|`|AA10279106	listen to Samvit.  he/she is right.|`|AA10241810	A haloalkane, also known as alkyl halogenide, halogenalkane or halogenoalkane, and alkyl halide is a chemical compound derived from an alkane by substituting one or more hydrogen atoms with halogen atoms. Substitution with fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine results in fluoroalkanes, chloroalkanes, bromoalkanes and iodoalkanes, respectively.    As you probably know, Carbons, have 4 bonding sites.  When a carbon is bonded to one other carbon, it is termed "primary" and any halogens attacheted to it are also termed primary.  If the carbon has 2 of its bonding sites bonded to carbons, it is termed secondary, and if a halogen is attached to one of the remaining 2 sites, it is termed a secondary haloalkane.|`|e49e4e468c66976c844c6890af442d33aa	In a primary haloalkane, the halogen is attached to a carbon which inturn is attached to a single carbon. eg. CH3-CH2-Br.  Secondary : eg. (CH3)2-CH-Br.  Tertiary : eg. (CH3)3-C-Br.    A primary carbon is attached to 1 carbon, a secondary attached to 2 carbons & tertiary to 3 carbon atoms.eg.  1 degree (primary) : CH3CH2CH2-CH3  Secondary : CH2-(CH3)2  Tertiary : CH-(CH3)3|`|dd5a300eafeff97e9ecc0b30c1774eccaa	Well, you are partly right. If a halogen atom is present in an alkyl group, then it is a Halo Alkane, and, if the halogen is attached to a primary carbon(i.e. a carbon that is attached to only one other carbon), then it is called a primary haloalkane. eg. CH2Cl - CH2- CH2- CH3 (1- chloro butane)- This is a primary Halo Alkane as The chlorine atom is attached to a carbon that is further attached to only 1 other carbon atom. Hence,a primary alkane. Similarly, if the halogen atom is attached to a Carbon Atom which is futher attached to two others, then it is a secondary haloalkane, while if it is 3, then tertiary. Hope, you got what I mean....

S?o exemplos de corantes inorganicos: dixido de titanio e xidos de ferro9. Os corantes naturais s?o derivados de plantas ou animais. Os corantes artificiais s?o sintetizados em laboratrio4.    O vermelho carmim (vermelho no. 4)  um exemplo de corante natural.  derivado do cido carmnico, extrado de corpos secos das fmeas do inseto Dactylopius coccus (cochonilha). J foram descritos alguns casos de asma ocupacional e alergia alimentar desencadeadas pelo carmim, cujo mecanismo fisiopatolgico  mediado por IgE4,10.    Dentre os corantes artificiais encontramos: os corantes azo - amarelo tartrazina (amarelo FD&C no. 5), amarelo crepsculo (amarelo FD&C no. 6), Bordeaux S (amaranto ou vermelho FD&C no. 2) e Ponceau 4R (vermelho FD&C no. 4) -, a eritrosina (vermelho FD&C no. 3) e o indigocarmim (azul FD&C no. 2)4.    O amarelo tartrazina  encontrado em inmeros medicamentos, cosmticos e alimentos. Possui estrutura qumica similar  dos benzoatos, salicilatos e indometacina, da a possibilidade de rea??es alrgicas cruzadas com esses frmacos5. Alm disso, a tartrazina pode desencadear hipercinesia em pacientes hiperativos e eosinofilia5. A ocorrncia de prpura n?o-trombocitopnica  rara, porm significa que a tartrazina tem capacidade de inibir a agrega??o plaquetria,  semelhan?a dos salicilatos, benzoato de sdio e metabissulfito de sdio11.    A hipersensibilidade  tartrazina ocorre em 0,6 a 2,9% da popula??o, com incidncia maior nos indivduos atpicos ou com intolerancia aos salicilatos. As manifesta??es clnicas mais comuns s?o: urticria, broncoespasmo, rinite e angioedema11. Apesar da baixa incidncia da sensibilidade  tartrazina na popula??o geral, os fabricantes s?o obrigados por lei a destacar uma advertncia na bula e na embalagem dos medicamentos que contm o corante12.    O corante amarelo crepsculo (FD&C no. 6) tambm pode provocar rea??es anafilactides, angioedema, choque anafiltico, vasculite e prpura. Pode haver rea??o cruzada entre o amarelo crepsculo, paracetamol, cido acetilsaliclico, benzoato de sdio e outros corantes azo5.    ABRA?OS!!

No intention of defaming any institution.)  There are many reasons.  -I dont think amity is affiliated to any university. Morover you cant trust these private colleges(when their recognition is cancelled).  -Another big reason :-They have already conducted 3-4 tests (i dont know exactly) for the same biotech course this year itself. They still have not been able to fill their seats for the course. You get a fair idea that smart people are not keen on joining this institute.  -One should always try for these courses in govt. colleges.  -Amity is one of the costliest.

Desde a antiguidade j se conhece o uso do carv?o vegetal. No antigo Egito era utilizado na purifica??o de leos e para aplica??es medicinais. Na segunda guerra mundial foi utilizado para remo??o de gases txicos devido a sua capacidade adsorvente sendo um material extremamente poroso. E entre os ndios brasileiros tambm h registro de uso, misturado s gorduras animais no tratamento de tumores e lceras malignas.    Estudos qumicos utilizando carv?o ativado detectaram uma redu??o significativa na produ??o de gases intestinais nos pacientes tratados, eliminando os desconfortos abdominais.  ainda um notvel condutor de oxignio, sendo um extraordinrio eliminador de toxinas.

30d55ac4d410ad58b0daf6b2934c7517aa	Atualmente, a chuva cida  um dos principais problemas ambientas nos pases industrializados. Ela  formada a partir de uma grande concentra??o de poluentes qumicos, que s?o despejados na atmosfera diariamente.  Estes poluentes, originados principalmente da queima de combustveis fsseis, formam nuvens, neblinas e at mesmo neve.    A chuva cida  composta por diversos cidos como, por exemplo, o xido de nitrognio e os dixidos de enxofre, que s?o resultantes da queima de combustveis fsseis (carv?o, leo diesel, gasolina entre outros). Quando caem em forma de chuva ou neve, estes cidos provocam danos no solo, plantas, constru??es histricas, animais marinhos e terrestres etc. Este tipo de chuva pode at mesmo provocar o descontrole de ecossistemas, ao exterminar determinados tipos de animais e vegetais. Poluindo rios e fontes de gua, a chuva pode tambm prejudicar diretamente a sade do ser humano, causando doen?as pulmonares, por exemplo.  as chuvas cidas, geralmente, concentram-se nos centros poluidores, podendo se deslocar, entretanto as nuvens tendem a precipitar-se rapidamente, o que focaliza seu raio de a??o.    Este problema tem se acentuado nos pases industrializados, principalmente nos que est?o em desenvolvimento como, por exemplo, Brasil, Rssia, China, Mxico e ndia. A setor industrial destes pases tem crescido muito, porm de forma desregulada, agredindo o meio ambiente.    Como exemlo, temos nas dcadas de 1970 e 1980, na cidade de Cubat?o, litoral de S?o Paulo, a chuva cida provocou muitos danos ao meio ambiente e ao ser humano. Os cidos poluentes jogados no ar pelas indstrias, estavam gerando muitos problemas de sade na popula??o da cidade. Foram relatados casos de crian?as que nasciam sem crebro ou com outros defeitos fsicos. A chuva cida tambm provocou desmatamentos significativos na Mata Atlantica da Serra do Mar.    Estudos feitos pela WWF ( Fundo Mundial para a Natureza ) mostraram que nos pases ricos o problema tambm aparece. Na Europa, por exemplo, estima-se que 40% dos ecossistemas est?o sendo prejudicados pela chuva cida e outras formas de polui??o.    como pode-se ver, infelizmente  um problema muito srio que envolve comprometimento de todos de forma global. vc t nessa ? espero que sim...bjtos.|`|AA11822898	Procura no seu livro de geografia q tem a resposta.|`|f167f3c656ec63d611a4ae86f2619bd0aa	Depende muito da geografia do local e dos ventos.

From these basic statements, valid conclusions are drawn by the use of logic. Axioms are assumptions, statements accepted as fact. These axioms are the building blocks, the foundation of our mathematical system. If there is a starting point, then this is it.    There are 11 field axioms (properties):    Addition:    1. Closure: a + b is a real number and is unique.  2. Associativity: (a + b) +c = a + (b + c)  3. Existence Of Identity: a + 0 = a and 0 + a =a  4.  Existence Of Inverses: a + (-a) = 0 and (-a) + a = 0  5. Commutativity: a + b = b + a      Multiplication:    6. Closure: ab is a real number and is unique.  7. Associativity: (ab)c = a(bc)  8. Existence Of Identity: a(1) = a and (1)a = a   9.  Existence Of Inverses: a(1/a) =1 and (1/a)a =1, a  0  10. Commutativity: ab = ba    11. Distributivity: a(b +c) = ab + bc and (b +c)a = bc + ca.    A set of numbers, together with operations of addition and multiplication satisfying these axioms is said to be a number field or simply a field.    There are also 3 axioms of equality:    Reflexive : a = a.  Symmetric: If a = b, then b = a.  Transitive: If a = b, and b = c, then a = c.    There is also an axiom for substitution:    Substitution: If a = c and b = d, then a + b = c + d and ab = cd.

AA10766672	Surgery is strongly advised! If you choose not to have surgery you can try physiotherapy and avoid anything that may injure your knee. For the exact course of physiotherapy that is indicated you will have to consult a specialist.    Depending on the ligament (there are 4 in the knee, anterior and posterior are most often torn) you will have to follow a different course. As a general rule you have to train both quadriceps and biceps (of the thigh) so that they will stabilize the knee.    Glucosamine and similar substances might be of some help (some of these are sold in gyms, too, but you can ask your doctor for the real prescription stuff) but I think they are most useful in meniscus injuries (which you probably also had? -- these often happen together with ligament tears).|`|b556ce38e877cbc01cc7059b6fcde9cdaa	If you tore your MCL then you can usually just get by with a little physical therapy.

I tore out my ACL over 20 years ago and have never had it fixed. It goes out from time to time, but I just deal with it.     If you cycle and build up your quadracept and hamstring muscles, this will help with the stability of your knee a lot.|`|68a1a876775e77b047d17f32f3e784a2aa	Go in for arthroscopic surgery.

Obwohl das Wesen des Magnetismus bis heute nicht restlos gekl?rt ist, wei? man, dass es was mit der Elektronenanordnung des Metalls zu tun hat. Deshalb l?sst sich trefflich drber streiten, ob es in das Reich der Physik oder der Anorganischen Chemie geh?rt.  Ganz grob kann man sagen, dass alle Stoffe erst einmal Diamagnetismus zeigen - also im Versuch die magnetischen Feldlinien "wegdrcken". Das kann aber berlagert werden von paramagnetischen Eigenschaften, die bei bestimmten Elektronenanordnungen auftreten, z.B. bei ungepaarten Elektronen in einem Orbital. Der Paramagnetismus kann bis zu 1000 mal gr??er sein als der diamagnetische Effekt.  Silber ist in seiner Grundkonfiguration diamagnetisch - oder um auf Deine Frage zu antworten: nicht magnetisch, weil es keine ungepaarten Elektronen hat.  ber den gut beobachtbaren Ferromagnetismus wollen wir das Deckm?ntelchen des Schweigens legen, weil es darber wahrscheinlich mehr Theorien gibt als Bcher.

Mit "magnetisch" meint man normalerweise "ferromagnetisch", also so magnetisch wie Eisen. Das sind in der Tat die Metall Eisen, Kobalt und Nickel. Einige Legierungen sind auch ferromagnetisch, und ein paar andere Elemente, aber nur sehr, sehr schwach (nur im Labor messbar).    Dann gibt es noch einige Stoffe mit ganz verrckten magnetischen Eigenschaften: Sauerstoff ist paramagnetisch, er wird von Magneten angezogen, und zwar von beiden Polen gleicherma?en und sogar gleichzeitig.

If it was changing then there would be a difference in the no. of photons entering and leaving the medium.  This will create a dark patch in the path of light.  But this doesn't happen.

df25f34b9d5b044d7539402e4f8ba754aa	n geometria, un'ellisse  una figura che assomiglia ad un cerchio allungato in una direzione. Questa figura  un esempio di sezione conica e pu essere definita come il luogo dei punti, in un piano, la cui somma delle distanze da due punti fissi dati (detti fuochi)  costante, cio sempre uguale. Secondo le leggi di Keplero, l'orbita di un pianeta  un'ellisse con il Sole in uno dei due fuochi.    Se i due fuochi coincidono, si ha una circonferenza, che pu considerarsi quindi un caso particolare di ellisse (ad eccentricit nulla). L'eccentricit di un'ellisse  compresa tra zero e uno.    Il segmento che passa dai due fuochi  detto asse maggiore ed  anche il pi lungo segmento contenuto nell'ellisse. Il segmento passante per il centro (a met tra i fuochi), ortogonale all'asse maggiore,  l'asse minore. Il semiasse maggiore  una delle met dell'asse maggiore; parte dal centro, passa attraverso un fuoco e va fino all'ellisse. Analogamente il semiasse minore  met dell'asse minore. I due assi sono l'equivalente per l'ellisse del diametro, mentre i due semiassi sono l'equivalente del raggio.    La dimensione e la forma di un'ellisse sono determinate da due costanti, dette convenzionalmente a e b. La costante a  la lunghezza del semiasse maggiore; la costante b  la lunghezza del semiasse minore.    Un'ellisse centrato nell'origine di un sistema di assi cartesiani x-y con l'asse maggiore posto lungo l'asse delle ascisse  definito dall'equazione:        \frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} + \frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1    La stessa ellisse  rappresentata anche dall'equazione parametrica:        x = a\,\cos t      y = b\,\sin t      0 \leq t     che fa uso delle funzioni trigonometriche seno e coseno.    La forma di un'ellisse  solitamente espressa da un numero detto eccentricit dell'ellisse, convenzionalmente denotata da e (da non confondere con la costante matematica e). L'eccentricit  legata ad a e b dall'espressione        e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{b^2}{a^2}}    L'eccentricit  un numero positivo compreso tra 1 e 0, (se  pari a 0, l'ellisse  degenerato in una circonferenza). Maggiore  l'eccentricit, maggiore  il rapporto tra a e b, quindi l'ellisse  pi allungata. La distanza tra i due fuochi  2ae.    Il semilato retto di un'ellisse, solitamente denotata dalla lettera l,  la distanza tra il fuoco dell'ellisse e l'ellisse stessa misurata lungo una linea perpendicolare all'asse maggiore.  legata ad a e b dalla formula al = b2.    In coordinate polari, un'ellisse con un fuoco nell'origine e l'altro lungo la parte negativa dell'asse delle ascisse  data dall'equazione:        r(1 + ecos) = l    Un'ellisse pu essere pensata anche come la proiezione di una circonferenza: una circonferenza su un piano con angolo  rispetto al piano orizzontale proiettata verticalmente su un piano orizzontale da un'ellisse di eccentricit sin , supponendo che  sia diverso da 90.     ED ECCO L'AREA:  L'area racchiusa da un'ellisse  *a*b. La circonferenza di un'ellisse  4aE(e), dove la funzione E  l'integrale ellittico del secondo tipo      Spero di esserti stata utile..!Baci..|`|65eb0156aa317c825c414e7dd5160a20aa	esiste una semplice formula ottenibile mediante calcolo integrale (che forse tu non hai ancora affrontato) data da:  pigreco x a x b  dove a e b sono le misure rispettivamente del semiasse maggiore e del semiasse minore dell'ellisse  buon lavoro  ciao|`|19cea4751a28a2866a1d8b517d1a651aaa	Prova a guardare qui:    http://web.tiscali.it/vaglieco/Sul%20Pia...

dcac33ece771245d7e2e3a133cadc6efaa	Resposta: O volume do novo sistema ser inferior a 200mL    Trata-se de um problema a ser analisado por partes.      Anlise para o etanol puro  No etanol puro, as intera??es intermoleculares s tem a possibilidade de formarem um tipo de par potencial, que  o par potencial etanol-etanol. Alm das intera??es intermoleculares, o etanol puro apresenta um determinado grau de empacotamento das molculas e uma determinada entropia, sendo esses trs parametros de anlise dependentes da temperatura e da press?o sobre o sistema. Os tipos de intera??es intermoleculares existentes nesse sistema s?o diversas e o importante  que essas intera??es ocorrem com tal intensidade de modo a conferir, juntamente com o empacotamento e a entropia,  propriedades caractersticas ao etanol, como sua densidade, por exemplo.    Anlise para a gua pura  Segue o mesmo raciocnio que a anlise do sistema contendo etanol puro    Anlise para a mistura gua + etanol.  Nessa mistura, alm da existncia dos pares potenciais gua-gua e etanol-etanol, um novo tipo de par potencial surge, o par potencial gua-etanol. A intensidade par potencial gua-etanol  maior que dos pares gua-gua e etanol-etanol. O surgimento de uma intera??o intermolecular mais intensa contribui para a contra??o do sistema que ocorre juntamente uma mudan?a no grau  empacotamento das molculas. Deve-se salientar tambm, que h um aumento na entropia do sistema quando comparado as substancias puras, surgindo, por exemplo, a entropia de mistura. Colocando-se numa "balan?a" os trs parametros comentados, e analisando-os antes e aps mistura, conclui-se que os volumes n?o s?o ADITIVOS, e que neste caso h uma contra??o do sistema.    Essas mudan?as nas intera??es intermoleculares podem ser observadas experimentalmente, pois, ao se  misturar gua e etanol h um aumento de temperatura do sistema, informando ao experimentador que energia foi liberada (processo exotrmico), em outras palavras, as intera??es que se formaram, s?o mais intensas do que as que existiam antes.|`|0400f283c180ae40e74cb850f9fe47e6aa	O volume no final sera inferior a 200 mL. Eu mesmo acabo de fazer tal experimento e obtive ~ 195 mL como resultado utilizando provetas que nao eh o mais preciso dos instrumentos de medicao de volume. Mas eh certo que o volume final eh inferior a 200 mL.    Isto acontece porque apos a mistura as moleculas desses dois liquidos irao se arranjar de uma nova maneira. A razao esta nas novas ligacoes de hidrogenio que irao ser formadas. Na agua e no alcool puros existem tais lligacoes. Mas na mistura desses dois uma nova rede dessas ligacoes sera formada de modo que o volume final sera reduzido.     Se voce fizer este experimento voce ira observar bolhas quando fizer esta mistura. Para faze-lo voce pode utilizar provetas. E se voce for cuidadoso ira observar tambem ligeiro aumento da temperatura. Com a mistura, inicialmente ha um aumento da entropia do sistema que eh logo minimizada para um estado onde ocorre a contracao do volume.|`|f167f3c656ec63d611a4ae86f2619bd0aa	200 mL n! por que 100 + 100 = 200! s por isso!

A for?a de intera??o intermolecular no etanol puro  uma. A for?a de intera??o intermolecular na gua pura  outra. Agora, quando voc mistura etanol e gua, a for?a de intera??o intermolecular da mistura resultante  maior do que nas substancias puras originais.  por isso que o volume n?o  uma propriedade aditiva quando falamos de misturas n?o ideais, como esse caso do etanol e da gua.    Substancias puras que, quando misturadas, esquentam ou esfriam o conjunto provavelmente s?o misturas n?o ideais. Mas que fique claro que isso n?o  condi??o suficiente!

Estas diferen?as geram as diferen?as organicas entre os organismos vivos. O DNA se encontra no ncleo celular e  formado por quatro nucleotdeos diferentes,que formam uma estrutura semelhante a uma escada em espiral. Os nucleotdeos s?o formados por uma base nitrogenada, uma desoxirribose e um grupamento fosfato. O DNA apresenta quatro bases distintas, Adenina, Timina,Guanina e Citosina. Estas bases se combinam aos pares: adenina interage com timina por meio de duas liga??es de hidrognio, enquanto guanina interage com citosina por meio de trs liga??es de hidrognio. A sequncia de pares de bases se assemelha aos degraus, enquanto a desoxirribose e o grupamento fosfato se alternam, apresentando semelhan?a com o corrim?o de uma escada em espiral. A dupla cadeia polinucleotdica constitui a molcula de DNA, cuja sequncia de nucleotdeos codifica as instru??es hereditrias, organizadas em genes, que codificam as inmeras protenas existentes nas mais variadas clulas. As molculas de DNA contm portanto a informa??o gentica necessria para a codifica??o das caractersticas de um indivduo, como a cor do cabelo em humanos, o formato da folha em Angiospermas e a morfologia bacteriana.|`|4b507d77d4d8d2b469912ad1de8b5d5eaa	Sim, um ser esquisito mais  vivo, u!!!|`|f167f3c656ec63d611a4ae86f2619bd0aa	n?o poderia ser uma vida latente?pergunto porque n?o tenho certeza!|`|38484210a7f82c018eaf5f1503b1a8a5aa	H duvidas entre os cientistas.

Na verdade, de acordo com as defini??es mais comuns para o conceito de "seres vivos", os vrus s?o entes naturais que nem podem ser considerados seres vivos nem seres n?o vivos.    Podem reproduzir-se e mostrar hereditariedade, mas s?o dependentes das complexas enzimas de seus hospedeiros, e podem de vrias formas ser tratados como molculas ordinrias, exemplo: podem ser cristalizados.    S?o parasitas obrigatrios, e n?o possuem forma de reprodu??o independente de seus hospedeiros. Da mesma forma que a maioria dos parasitas, eles tm um certo nmero de hospedeiros especficos, algumas vezes especficos a apenas uma espcie (ou at mesmo limitados a apenas um tipo de clula da espcie) e em outros casos, mais abrangente. Os vrus que atacam as clulas animais n?o atacam as vegetais e vice-versa. No entanto, existem alguns vrus vegetais que se multiplicam nas clulas de insectos, que os disseminam de uma planta para a outra.    Fora do organismo do seu hospedeiro, cristalizam e comportam-se como qualquer matria inanimada.|`|961248e399fa1be27f3dc1cbde762b7aaa	[E  lgico que sim .

Existem os microscpios at?micos.|`|0be099a37f5d3ddddc238d81d781f5c7aa	Os atomistas na antiga Grcia  Acreditava-se que a matria seria constituda de elementos da natureza como fogo, gua, terra e ar, que misturados em diferentes propor??es resultariam em propriedades fsico-qumicas diferentes.    Leucipo e Demcrito imaginaram que a matria n?o poderia ser dividida infinitamente, mas partindo-a vrias vezes, chegaramos a uma partcula muito pequena: uma esfera indivisvel, impenetrvel e invisvel. Com a ajuda de Lucrcio, a idia dos filsofos teve rpida propaga??o.    O modelo de Dalton  Os principais postulados da Teoria At?mica de Dalton s?o: a matria  formada por partculas extremamente pequenas chamadas tomos; os tomos s?o esferas maci?as, indestrutveis e intransformveis; tomos que apresentam mesmas propriedades (tamanho, massa e forma) constituem um elemento qumico; tomos de elementos diferentes possuem propriedades diferentes; os tomos podem se unir entre si formando "tomos compostos"; uma rea??o qumica nada mais  do que a uni?o e separa??o de tomos.    O modelo de Thomson  Em 1903, o cientista ingls Joseph J. Thomson, baseado em experincias realizadas com gases e que mostraram que a matria era formada por cargas eltricas positivas e negativas, modificou o modelo at?mico de Dalton. Segundo Thomson, o tomo seria uma esfera maci?a e positiva com as cargas negativas distribudas, ao acaso, na esfera. A quantidade de cargas positivas e negativas seriam iguais e dessa forma o tomo seria eletricamente neutro. O modelo proposto por Thomson ficou conhecido como "pudim de ameixas".    O modelo de Rutherford  Em 1911, o cientista neozelands Ernest Rutherford, utilizando os fen?menos radiativos no estudo da estrutura at?mica, descobriu que o tomo n?o seria uma esfera maci?a, mas sim formada por uma regi?o central, chamada ncleo at?mico, e uma regi?o externa ao ncleo, chamada eletrosfera. No ncleo at?mico estariam as partculas positivas, os prtons, e na eletrosfera as partculas negativas, os eltrons.    O modelo de Niels Bohr e a mecanica quantica  O modelo planetrio de Rutherford foi um grande avan?o para a comunidade cientfica, provando que o tomo n?o era maci?o. Segundo a Teoria Eletromagntica, toda carga eltrica em movimento em torno de outra, perde energia em forma de ondas eletromagnticas. E justamente por isso tal modelo gerou certo desconforto, pois os eltrons perderiam energia em forma de ondas eletromagnticas, confinando-se no ncleo, tornando a matria algo instvel.    Bohr, que trabalhava com Rutherford prop?s o seguinte modelo: o ncleo contendo os prtons e nutrons e definiu as rbitas estacionrias, onde o eltron orbitaria o ncleo, sem que perdesse energia. Entre duas rbitas, temos as zonas proibidas de energia, pois s  permitido que o eltron esteja em uma das rbitas. Ao receber um fton, o eltron salta de rbita, n?o num movimento contnuo, passando pela rea entre as rbitas(da o nome zona proibida), mas simplesmente desaparecendo de uma rbita e reapade exata de energia. Se um pacote com energia insuficiente para mandar o eltron para rbitas superiores encontrar o eltron, nada ocorre. Mas se um fton com a energia exata para que o eltron salte para rbitas superiores, ele certamente o far, depois, devolvendo a energia absorvida em forma de ondas eletromagnticas.|`|c727c96132d3b64f55a9bf87e438c918aa	Os microscpios por varredura de tunelamento de eltrons conseguem visualizar n?o s o tomo como o seu ncleo.

Depois do primeiro parto, ou da transfus?o acidental, o sangue da m?e entra em contacto com o sangue do feto e cria anticorpos contra os antgenos presentes nas hemcias caracterizadas pelo Rh+. Durante a segunda gravidez, esses anticorpos podem atravessar a placenta e provocar a hemlise do sangue da segunda crian?a. Esta reac??o nem sempre ocorre e  menos provvel se a crian?a tiver os antignios A ou B e a m?e n?o os tiver.    Os anticorpos anti-Rh n?o existem naturalmente no sangue das pessoas, sendo fabricados apenas por indivduos Rh-, quando estes recebem transfus?es de sangue Rh+. Pessoas Rh+ nunca produzem anticorpos anti-Rh, pois se o fizessem provocariam a destrui??o de suas prprias hemcias.    No passado, a incompatibilidade podia resultar na morte da m?e ou do feto, sendo, tambm, uma causa importante de incapacidade a longo prazo - incluindo danos cerebrais e insuficincia heptica. A situa??o era tratada atravs da transfus?o do sangue do bebe, caso este sobrevivesse, logo aps o nascimento ou, mais raramente (e com alguma controvrsia) atravs de terapia fetal, como em 1963 - altura em que se realizou a primeira transfus?o de sangue a um feto. Hoje pode-se tratar com alguns antisoros anti-Rh(+) (Mathergan, Partogama ou RhoGAM - esta ltima tambm designada por imunoglobulina anti-D, em referncia ao antignio D, o mais importante antignio do factor Rh).

Se este for Rh+, a m?e deve receber uma injec??o de imunoglobulina contra o factor Rh nas primeiras 72 horas aps o parto, de forma a impedir a forma??o dos anticorpos que poderiam criar complica??es nas gesta??es seguintes.    espero q posso ter te ajudado se quiser mais imforma?ao vai no   http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eritroblast...|`|6af977fc607005b960ccfffbcdc5edf5aa	 uma doen?a provocada pela incompatibilidade do sangue da m?e e do beb e pode ocasionar graves seqelas neurolgicas, como retardo mental, surdez parcial ou total, m-forma??o dentria e rigidez muscular.

O ar que est l dentro, e na parte de cima, se resfria e isso faz com que ele se torne mais denso.  Esse aumento na sua densidade faz com que esse ar mais frio se desloque pra parte debaixo da geladeira.  Com isso, h uma reoganiza??o do ar que est dentro dessa geladeira, fazendo com que o ar que est mais quente v para a parte de cima.  A esse processo contnua, contnua, contnua...  De tal modo que a temperatura caa.  O motivo que leva ao funcionamento da geladeira  o motor, o qual funciona para que ocorra transferncia de calor de fora para dentro.   por esse motivo que, enqanto a sua geladeira est com a parte interna resfriada, a grade que fica atrs dela fique bem quente...

Il chirurgo  necessario per la parte fisio-anatomica, devi pensare che i nervi che arrivano alla mano dx non sono gli stessi della mano sx perch hanno diversi punti di partenza a livello del cervello e poi, come ho gi letto da un'altra persona, comunque nn ci sarebbero strutture sufficienti per il movimento (le cinque dita in pi sarebbero inerti).    Lo psicologo valuta le tue motivazioni, in base a quello che potranno essere le tue reazioni post operatorie e allo schok che ti potrebbe causare la vista delle tue mani (pensa che una sarebbe priva di dita). Se le tue non sono motivazioni basate su forti convinzioni potresti averne uno squilibrio mentale.    comunque questa prassi  seguita anche per le piccole cose come ad esempio rifarsi il naso, o le tette o interventi di liposuzione.|`|bf2d38585acf0967804391bb938c9c5caa	credo che potrebbe fartelo solo se sull'altra mano potesse metterti che ne so un rastrello, cos rimarrebbe utile!

Cancer is of 2 types benign(concentrated only at a place)and malignent(effects whole body by transfering from one place to another).  So if you eat harmful things like tobacco or keeps on smoking etc.  slowly you can get cancer.bcoz they have such toxins which can cause cancer by altering your genes.  Cabbage can help u bcoz it has an enzyme- alilisothiocynate which attack cancerous cells in their initial stage stoping them from being malignent.  cheers!    if you want more information about this you are welcome to contact me -manushaanjel@yohoo.com|`|AA11159273	What you put in your body has is clearly a factor.  Smoking causes cancer.  (The smoking industry won't admit it, but it has been proven!)    Is it genetic? Maybe, but I don't think anyone has actually proven it.|`|b99787d6fd19681d8aff99eb75859be9aa	Cynthe.... is right, but let me add that the proper diet can also prevent or at least delay the onset of the cancer.|`|ffa3e897681d4c71f7662a02b5f87bb0aa	There is no proof that cancer is genetic, but anecdotal evidence and studies done on families does suggest that this is the case.    There are definitely factors that can increase or decrease the likely hood of an individual getting cancer. No studies done so far can explain why, if you take two people with exactly the same habits, living in similar environements, one will get cancer and the other won't.    I think that most likely some people are pre-disposed to get cancer and some are not. If you are not, it is unlikely that you will get cancer weather you live carefully or not. If you are however watching what you eat and what you are exposed to can be very important.    We know there are many people who smoke or eat lots of carcenogens that don't get cancer. We also know that lots of people who stay away from unhealthy choices still get cancer. Since this is the case, it's not likely that environmental conditions are the only factor. In fact, it suggests that genetics is the primary factor and other factors only increase or decrease that genetic predisposition.    Because we don't know how to tell if someone is genetically suseptible to cancers, we don't know for sure what effect diet has. The safest bet would be to eat healthy. If you're not going to get cancer anyway, it didn't hurt you and if you might, it might save you.    As for smoking, while it does seem that the general consensus is that smoking causes cancer, I don't know. It certainly is the cause of many other nasty diseases of the heart and lungs that are at least as fatal. So that should be a good enough reason not to start.|`|cf7274965b6b7e742c187c4664c2419baa	Both. If youre genetically predisposed to get cancer, your diet can be a trigger.

Your mother is wrong. It appears blue because as sunlight enters the atmosphere a process called Rayleigh scattering occurs which affects the different colors of sunlight to differing degrees.

IT IS NOT THE REFLECTION OF THE OCEAN.|`|91058434ebde85d4f301e5060a067870aa	This is one of those eternal questions, like why are some people so stupid?

Or church. Or on the street. Or on TV.|`|95909e7f492a3016a6aab247d3b20594aa	The blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering. As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air.     However, much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules. The absorbed blue light is then radiated in different directions. It gets scattered all around the sky. Whichever direction you look, some of this scattered blue light reaches you. Since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue.     As you look closer to the horizon, the sky appears much paler in color. To reach you, the scattered blue light must pass through more air. Some of it gets scattered away again in other directions. Less blue light reaches your eyes. The color of the sky near the horizon appears paler or white.

Assim a excita??o dos eltrons libera um montante de energia diferente, de acordo com a valncia e outros tipos de caractersticas dos ons. O processo n?o  t?o simples, mas segue a seguinte linha:  Excitar "esse" eltron n?o  a mesma coisa que excitar "aquele" eltron: com a diferen?a entre rais at?micos, energias de ioniza??o, nmeros at?micos etc  possvel inferir que os orbitais, e portanto, os nveis energticos dos eltrons de diferentes ons n?o deve ser o mesmo. Logo, mesmo dois ons monovalentes podem n?o apresentar mesma colora??o. Alm disso, mesmo que nos mesmos orbitais, dois eltrons de valncia n?o s?o excitados ao mesmo tempo e isso altera a frequncia de emiss?o de ftons aps essa excita??o (ftons: partculas, pacotes de energia dos quais a luz  constituida). A freqncia determina a colora;o da chama. Em ons de valncias diferentes isso  ainda mais influente, pois maior nmero de eltrons ir emitr ftons.

Dado que el nivel del mar no es constante debido a las mareas, ni tampoco es igual en distintos lugares de la Tierra, en cada pas se toma un nivel predeterminado en un lugar concreto y a determinada hora.    Cualquier altitud que se quiera calcular en dicho pas (o sus aguas nacionales) se har en comparacin con respecto a este nivel predeterminado.

Como tecnologia de objetivos gerais, porm, teria um uso duplo, ou seja, teria mltiplas aplica??es comerciais e tambm militares : seria possvel produzir, por exemplo, armas e aparelhos de vigilancia muito mais potentes .

Na escala nanomtrica, os tomos revelam caractersticas peculiares, podendo apresentar tolerancia  temperatura, cores, reatividade qumica, condutividade eltrica, ou mesmo exibir for?a de intensidade extraordinria. Estas caractersticas explicam o interesse industrial pelos nanomateriais que j s?o fabricados em toneladas para emprego em cosmticos, tintas, revestimentos, tecidos, catalisadores ou para proporcionar mais resistncia aos materiais.    Multidisciplinar por natureza, a nanotecnologia tem o potencial de revolucionar amplamente vrios campos tecnolgicos e cientficos, como os da biologia, da fsica, qumica e engenharia. Quando aplicada s cincias da vida recebe o nome de nanobiotecnologia. As proposi??es da nanobiotecnologia s?o inmeras e falar delas pode, muitas vezes, parecer que se est descrevendo cenas de um filme de fic??o cientfica.    No fantstico mundo da nanobiotecnologia ser possvel a inven??o de dispositivos ultrapequenos que, usando conhecimentos da biologia e da engenharia, devem examinar, manipular ou imitar os sistemas biolgicos. Assim, superfcies nanofabricadas com padr?es estruturais poderiam fazer crescer artificialmente ilhas pancreticas e reverter os efeitos da diabetes. Outros nanodispositivos poderiam funcionar como kits de reparo de neur?nios para pessoas com mal de Parkinson ou doen?a de Alzheimer.    Certos dispositivos minsculos seriam capazes de percorrer todo o organismo para encontrar e destruir vrus ou clulas cancerosas, reparar danos feitos pela radia??o; outros poderiam transportar de forma ultraespecfica drogas diretamente para o alvo. Determinados dispositivos mdicos, os nanorob?s, poderiam ter biomotores empregando energia do prprio organismo e partes mveis n?o maiores que uma molcula de protena. Alguns deles poderiam ser usados para desobstruir os vasos sangneos.    Biossensores para poluentes ainda n?o possveis com a tecnologia vigente constituem um outro alvo da nanobiotecnologia; aplicados  sade pblica, poderiam levar  detec??o de contaminantes bacterianos em gua e alimentos, encontrar melhores formas de detectar baixos nveis de toxinas ou proporcionar diagnsticos laboratoriais mais rpidos.    De maneira geral, a nanobiotecnologia poder levar  descoberta acelerada de drogas, com menor custo.    Se por um lado ainda est longe (cerca de 10, 20 anos) a viabilidade de constru??o de grande parte desses nanodispositivos, hoje  bastante plausvel o uso de nanossistemas para veicula??o de drogas e tratamento de inmeras doen?as, como os que se baseiam em lipossomos e nanopartculas. Estes sistemas ficam especialmente interessantes se forem construdos a partir de materiais magnticos.     Uma simples inje??o pode liberar milhares e at milh?es de partculas magnticas, ou nanom?s, na corrente sangnea de uma pessoa. Essas partculas poderiam, a seguir, ser conduzidas para uma regi?o especfica do corpo por meio de um campo magntico externo. Uma das aplica??es possveis para esse sistema constitudo por nanom?s  o transporte de drogas quimioterpicas especificamente para a rea do tumor, sem que estas drogas afetem os tecidos normais. Considerando que nos dias de hoje os quimioterpicos para cancer tm que ser administrados em altas doses para que possam destruir as clulas tumorais e que, sendo altamente txicos, acabam afetando tambm os tecidos normais do organismo, podendo gerar at mesmo um cancer secundrio, esta aplica??o da nanobiotecnologia assume importancia considervel.  uma forma de se obter a maximiza??o do efeito da droga, minimizando seus efeitos colaterais.    Uma outra aplica??o interessante para as nanopartculas magnticas vem da possibilidade de associ-las a anticorpos monoclonais, molculas feitas sob medida para reconhecer e se ligar s clulas tumorais. A associa??o de partculas magnticas s clulas tumorais aumenta a sensibilidade em exames de ressonancia magntica, proporcionando um diagnstico mais precoce de metstases tumorais uma vez que, dessa forma,  possvel a detec??o de metstases com menos de 1mm de diametro, o que  impossvel atualmente. Como se sabe, a metstase  um dos graves problemas associados ao cancer, pois dificulta o extermnio total das clulas tumorais. Quanto mais cedo puderem ser detectadas, maiores as chances de que o tratamento para o cancer venha proporcionar um resultado favorvel para o paciente. Mas as vantagens desse mtodo n?o cessam a. Uma vez detectada a presen?a de clulas tumorais por sua associa??o com as partculas magnticas, pode-se fazer com que estas partculas comecem a vibrar pela a??o de um campo magntico externo ao organismo. Essa vibra??o das partculas magnticas dissipar o calor nas clulas tumorais associadas, provocando sua lise e morte. O processo, conhecido como magnetotermocitlise (morte celular por calor gerado magneticamente), , portanto, uma aplica??o fantstica dos processos nanobiotecnolgicos, pois leva  destrui??o especfica de clulas cancerosas, sem afetar as clulas normais dos tecidos vizinhos.    Um dos desafios para o uso das partculas magnticas  controlar sua rejei??o pelo organismo. Para tal, elas devem estar recobertas por material biocompatvel. Outro n?o menos importante  ligar o anticorpo s partculas magnticas de forma que ainda continue apto a encontrar as clulas tumorais.    Liderada pela Universidade de Braslia (UnB), esta pesquisa em nanobiotecnologia empregando sistemas magnticos  alvo de pesquisadores das reas de biologia, fsica e qumica que integram parte da Rede de Pesquisa em Nanobiotecnologia (MCT/CNPq). |`|6a58c355533a259991ef6fed28c58addaa	 a tecnologia empregada para criar e construir coisas em escala muito pequena, 100 mil vezes menor que um milmetro.

Y todas las criaturas de la Tierra, que viven en distintos puntos de ella, tienen apariencias distintas: en color de piel, rasgos faciales, etc. El sol determina cambios climticos en cada zona [estaciones], y adems alumbra una parte mientras la otra permanece en la oscuridad. Hay lugares iluminados siempre y que no se encontrar en ellos noche sino en perodos de tiempos cortos [los polos]. Porque as est escrito en los Salmos (Tehilim 139) Te agradezco por las luminarias y son sorprendentes Tus obras. Y este secreto es transmitido por la sabidura de la Tor".

El amor es una sensacin provocada por una serie de hormonas, el amor romntico lo provocan las mismas hormonas que provocan lo que solemos llamar (instinto materno) en los mamferos (humanos incluidos) esas hormonas se llaman "feromonas" y cumplen adems con otras funciones como estimular la produccin de leche en las hembras al parir.  . La evolucin "invent" esas hormonas y la sensibilidad por ellas que genera la dependencia de un miembro por el otro de la pareja, para aumentar la probabilidad de supervivencia del recin nacido manteniendo juntos a sus padres.   . Desgraciadamente el amor romntico por la pareja provocado por las feromonas no dura ms de tres a?os (en los humanos) despus del ltimo parto de la hembra. Otros factores mantienen la pareja unida despus de eso o la separan antes, pero lo que llamamos "la qumica del amor" se limita a lo dicho.  . En las parejas jvenes el enamoramiento qumico se "pincha" cuando pasa mucho tiempo sin procrear, el instinto de reproduccin que los humanos conservamos intacto de nuestros antepasados, segrega otros qumicos para deshacer la pareja infrtil y con ello que cada cul consiga otra cunto antes para procrear. Nuevamente otros factores no qumicos pueden evitar la separacin o adelantarla, yo me refiero al amor qumico o amor romntico, ese que se siente en el estmago y que si se acaba aparece todo lo contrario y un irrefrenable impulso de formar una nueva pareja.  . Pues bien, s, se acaba el amor, es lo ms frecuente y natural, parejas enamoradas por toda la vida puedes contarlas con los dedos de una mano, otras emociones mantiene parejas unidas ms all de las feromonas, frecuentemente se confunden con amor, pero habrs oido casos de quien estando en pareja de pronto se enamora de otra persona y cuenta: -nunca me haba enamorado as, me rob el corazn el alma y todo mi ser-.   . Bueno, al que relata esa historia lo que le pas es que le volvieron las feromonas pero por otra persona, no por su pareja, ya haba olvidado esa sensacin y crea que lo que senta por su vieja pareja era amor. Hasta que de pronto volvi el amor qumico, el irresistible.  .  As es mi amiga, el amor qumico, el ms fuerte, el irresistible, ese amor dura poco, si lo quieres hacer eterno tienes que trabajar mucho, generando a diario motivos para enamorarte de tu pareja y que ella se enamore de t, hacer que se enamoren fsica e intelectualmente, ese ejercicio tambin genera qumicos que producen sensaciones muy parecidas al amor, se llaman endorfinas y si las saben disfrutar estarn enamorados de por vida. Eso s, es muy difcil, ms fcil es enamorarse de otro/a.

AA11808736	O sarcoma de Kaposi  um cancer que se origina nos vasos sangneos, geralmente da pele. O sarcoma de Kaposi pode assumir duas formas. A primeira  uma doen?a que afeta os indivduos idosos, freqentemente de origem europia, judia ou italiana, nos quais o cancer cresce muito lentamente sobre a pele e raramente dissemina- se. A segunda forma afeta crian?as e homens jovens da frica equatorial e indivduos com AIDS. Esta forma do sarcoma de Kaposi cresce muito mais rapidamente e, freqentemente, envolve vasos sangneos de rg?os internos. Nos homens idosos, o sarcoma de Kaposi geralmente aparece como uma mancha prpura ou castanho escura localizada sobre os dedos dos ps ou sobre um dos membros inferiores. O cancer pode crescer vrios centmetros ou mais, na forma de uma rea escura, plana ou discretamente elevada, a qual tende a sangrar e a ulcerar. O cancer pode disseminar-se lentamente por todo o membro inferior. Entre os africanos e os indivduos com AIDS, o sarcoma de Kaposi comumente aparece como uma mancha cor-de-rosa, vermelha ou prpura, redonda ou oval. Essas manchas podem surgir em qualquer parte do corpo, freqentemente na face. Em alguns meses, as manchas podem aparecer em vrias partes do corpo, inclusive na boca. Elas tambm podem ocorrer em rg?os internos e em linfonodos, podendo causar hemorragia interna.     Tratamento     Os indivduos idosos com um sarcoma de Kaposi de crescimento lento e sem outros sintomas podem n?o necessitar de tratamento. No entanto, as manchas podem ser tratadas por congelamento, radioterapia ou eletrocauteriza??o (destrui??o dos tecidos usando uma sonda eltrica). Nos indivduos com AIDS e naqueles com a forma mais agressiva, o tratamento n?o tem sido muito eficaz. A quimioterapia usando medicamentos como etopsido, vincristina, vimblastina, bleomicina e doxorrubicina tem dado resultados desapontadores. O interferon-alfa pode retardar a progress?o dos tumores cutaneos iniciais e uma inje??o de vincristina nos tumores pode fazer com que eles regridam. Aparentemente, o tratamento do sarcoma de Kaposi n?o prolonga a vida dos indivduos com AIDS. A melhoria do estado imunolgico do paciente pode acarretar uma regress?o do sarcoma de Kaposi.|`|9dd3a55e4b99a8df2e1d1b669c35b637aa	S?o as marcas escuras na pele indicando uma doen?a.|`|ace3a21b7b110929dc79ab14dfc4a285aa	DST.|`|c3d35d0026664b0cc34a95b7112e7058aa	Bolhas, sapinhos.

Uma agncia britanica responsvel pelo monitoramento de asterides potencialmente perigosos para a Terra revelou que existe a possibilidade de que ele colida com o planeta em 2014.    De acordo com o Centro de Monitoramento de Objetos prximos  Terra, astr?nomos dos Estados Unidos descobriram um grande asteride que estaria se aproximando rapidamente.

No entanto, os cientistas acreditam que a chance de que a colis?o realmente ocorra  estatisticamente pequena.     O risco previsto de impacto tambm pode diminuir mais  medida que os estudiosos coletarem mais dados.    O asteride, cujo nome  2003 QQ 47, se aproxima da Terra a uma velocidade de cerca de 32 quil?metros por segundo (32.000 metros por segundo ou mais de 115.000 Km por hora!).

Most are of herbivorous nature, though a few land species and many marine species may be omnivores or carnivores. Other gastropods, which lack a conspicuous shell, are commonly called slugs, and are scattered throughout groups that primarily include snails. While most people are familiar with only terrestrial snails, the majority of snails are not terrestrial. Snails with lungs belong to the group Pulmonata, while those with gills form a paraphyletic group.    Reproduction  Two snails investigate each other prior to mating  Enlarge  Two snails investigate each other prior to mating    All land snails are hermaphrodites, producing both spermatozoa and ova. Others, such as Apple Snails, are either male or female. Prolific breeders, snails inseminate each other in pairs to internally fertilize their ova. Each brood may consist of up to 100 eggs.    Snails have small slits on their necks where fertilisation occurs and the eggs develop.    Garden snails bury their eggs in shallow topsoil primarily while the weather is warm and damp. After 2 to 4 weeks of favorable weather, these eggs hatch and the young emerge. Snails may lay eggs as often as once a month.
968bc7c8dfa5c8ee23e19a7e540db963aa	The Three Laws of Motion    Newton's Laws of Motion describe only the motion of a body as a whole and are valid only for motions relative to a reference frame. The following are brief modern formulations of Newton's three laws of motion:    First Law  Objects in motion tend to stay in motion, and objects at rest tend to stay at rest unless an outside force acts upon them.    Second law  The rate of change of the momentum of a body is directly proportional to the net force acting on it, and the direction of the change in momentum takes place in the direction of the net force.    Third law  To every action (force applied) there is an equal but opposite reaction (equal force applied in the opposite direction).    It is important to note that these three laws together with his law of gravitation provide a satisfactory basis for the explanation of motion of everyday macroscopic objects under everyday conditions. However, when applied to extremely high speeds or extremely small objects, Newton's laws break down; this was remedied by Albert Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity for high speeds and by quantum mechanics for small objects.|`|ead1b74983c3768f415e0ce2695f50b7aa	Please consult this site, very detailed .  http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/...

ec71082513e06a45cde335e90f1189a4aa	No Seculo 18 Lavoisier conseguiu finalmente mostrar que o tomo (palavra grega que significa indivisvel)  a base das substancias qumicas. Mendeleev prosseguiu o trabalho e chegou  tabela peridica dos elementos onde classificou os diferentes tipos de tomos . Assim responderam a uma pergunta muito antiga, que foi discutida por Demcrito, sobre a divisibilidade da matria.  No entanto no sculo 19 e 20 continuou-se a dividir o tomo. Thompsom mostrou que o tomo continha particulas menores, os electr?es. At hoje n?o se conseguiram dividir os electr?es. Mas Rutherford mostrou que a maior parte da massa do tomo est concentrada no ncleo. Cavendish mostrou que o ncleo  composto por protons e neutrons.  Nos anos 1950 e 1960 conseguiram finalmente dividir os protons e os neutrons, que afinal eram compostos por quarks.  Os quarks tm massa, carga eltrica, e ainda trs novas propriedades a que se d o nome spin, de sabor e cor. Assim as suas propriedades s?o muito ricas e ainda est?o a ser investigadas pelos cientistas.  Destaca-se a propriedade do confinamento, que esta relacionada com o recente prmio Nobel de 2004.  que n?o se conseguiu ainda isolar um quark, pois eles ficam sempre prximos uns dos outros.  Para tentar dividir partculas como o eletron ou o quark, os cientistas experimentam chocar com a energia mais alta possvel eletrons ou ncleos. Usam aceleradores de partculas, que multiplicam por mais de 1000000000 a sua energia E=mc^2. Cada choque pode conseguir criar milhares de outros quarks ou eletrons, mas at ao momento, todos acabaram por estar "inteiros" e n?o "partidos".    Um quark  um constituinte da matria muito pequeno. Reside em regi?es da ordem de 1/10000000000000000 do metro.

Os ncleos com nmero de massa grande est?o sujeitos  fiss?o espontanea com uma probabilidade muito pequena e sujeitos  fiss?o induzida artificialmente com uma probabilidade bem maior. Pode-se induzir a fiss?o de um ncleo excitando-o com uma energia de pelo menos 4 a 6 MeV ou bombardeando-o com nutrons, desde que um desses nutrons seja capturado e que a soma da sua energia cintica com a sua energia de liga??o ao ncleo seja maior do que o limiar de energia para a fiss?o. Por exemplo, um ncleo de uranio 235 pode sofrer fiss?o ao capturar um nutron mesmo que ele tenha uma energia cintica muito baixa, da ordem de 0,025 eV (nutron lento ou trmico), e um ncleo de uranio 238 pode sofrer fiss?o ao capturar um nutron desde que ele tenha uma energia cintica grande, da ordem de 1 MeV (nutron rpido).

Por volta de 400 anos a.C. filsofo grego Demcrito sugeriu que a matria n?o  contnua, isto , ela  feita de minsculas partculas indivisveis. Essas partculas foram chamadas de tomos (a palavra tomo significa, em grego, indivisvel).           Demcrito postulou que todas as variedades de matria resultam da combina??o de tomos de quatro elementos: terra, ar, fogo e gua.           Demcrito baseou seu modelo na intui??o e na lgica. No entanto foi rejeitado por um dos maiores lgicos de todos os tempos, o filosofo Aristteles. Este reviveu e fortaleceu o modelo de matria contnua, ou seja, a matria como "um inteiro".           Os argumentos de Aristteles permaneceram at a Renascen?a.         Todo modelo n?o deve ser somente lgico, mas tambm consistente com a experincia. No sculo XVII, experincias demonstraram que o comportamento das substancias era inconsistente com a idia de matria contnua e o modelo de Aristteles desmoronou.           Em 1808, John Dalton, um professor ingls, prop?s a idia de que as propriedades da matria podem ser explicadas em termos de comportamento de partculas finitas, unitrias. Dalton acreditou que o tomo seria a partcula elementar, a menor unidade de matria.           Surgiu assim o modelo de Dalton: tomos vistos como esferas minsculas, rgidas e indestrutveis. Todos os tomos de um elemento s?o idnticos.              Em 1987, o fsico ingls J.J. Thomson demonstrou que os raios catdicos poderiam ser interpretados como um feixe de partculas carregadas que foram chamadas de eltrons. A atribui??o de carga negativa aos eltrons foi arbitrria.           Thomson concluiu que o eltron deveria ser um componente de toda matria, pois observou que a rela??o e/m para os raios catdicos tinha o mesmo valor, qualquer que fosse o gs colocado na ampola de vidro.           Em 1989, Thomson apresentou o seu modelo at?mico: uma esfera de carga positiva na qual os eltrons, de carga negativa, est?o distribudos mais ou menos uniformemente. A carga positiva est distribuda, homogeneamente, por toda a esfera.        Em 1911, Rutherford e colaboradores (Geiger e Marsden) bombardearam uma lamina metlica delgada com um feixe de partculas alfa atravessava a lamina metlica sem sofrer desvio na sua trajetria (para cada 10.000 partculas alfa que atravessam sem desviar, uma era desviada). Para explicar a experincia, Rutherford concluiu que o tomo n?o era uma bolinha maci?a.           Admitiu uma parte central positiva muito pequena mas de grande massa ("o ncleo") e uma parte envolvente negativa e relativamente enorme ("a eletrosfera ou coroa").           Se o tomo tivesse o tamanho do Estdio do Morumbi, o ncleo seria o tamanho de uma azeitona. Surgiu assim o modelo nuclear do tomo.           O modelo de Rutherford  o modelo planetrio do tomo, no qual os eltrons descrevem um movimento circular ao redor do ncleo, assim como os planetas se movem ao redor do sol.        O modelo planetrio de Rutherford apresenta duas falhas:           Uma carga negativa, colocada em movimento ao redor de uma carga positiva estacionria, adquire movimento espiralado em sua dire??o acabando por colidir com ela.  Essa carga em movimento perde energia, emitindo radia??o. Ora, o tomo no seu estado normal n?o emite radia??o.           Em 1913, o fsico dinamarqus Niels Bohr exp?s uma idia que modificou o modelo planetrio do tomo.           Um eltron num tomo s pode ter certas energias especficas, e cada uma destas energias corresponde a uma rbita particular. Quanto maior a energia do eltron, mais afastada do ncleo se localiza a sua rbita.           Se o eltron receber energia ele pula para uma rbita mais afastada do ncleo.   Por irradia??o de energia, o eltron pode cair numa rbita mais prxima do ncleo. No entanto, o eltron n?o pode cair abaixo de sua rbita normal estvel.           Mais tarde, Sommerfeld postulou a existncia de rbitas n?o s circulares mas elpticas tambm.   ______________________________________...    ENT?O, CONCLUINDO:    TOMO N?O  INDIVISVEL.

No princpio, os gregos formularam a idia de que a menor parte da matria seria o "tomo", ou seja, "a = n?o"  e "tomo = divisvel".     Se algum fosse dividindo em partes menores qualquer material (pedra, ferro, ouro, etc.), chegaria a um ponto em que isso n?o mais seria possvel, ent?o estaria diante de um "tomo".    Posteriormente descobriu-se que n?o era assim, pois no caso da gua (exemplo mais comum), temos dois tomos de hidrognio e um tomo de oxignio. E cada tomo em particular, hidrognio, oxignio, prata ou ouro, a distin??o de um para outro, se d justamente pelo fato de eles serem uma estrutura (portanto divisvel), composta de partculas menores (elementares), que s?o "prtons", "neutrons" e "eletrons".    Conclumos que os prtons, neutrons e eletrons s?o como pecinhas de "LEGO" (brinquedo de crian?a pra montar), e na montagem dessas "pecinhas" temos os tomos.    Juntando os tomos, teremos as "molculas", como a da "gua".     Agora, o mais incrvel  que se pegarmos um prton, neutron ou eletron, a gente ainda pode divid-los em partes menores.    Minha conclus?o, n?o querendo ser muito tcnico,  que nesse sequncia divisria, chegaremos ao "tomo" idealizado pelos gregos. S que n?o ser ouro, prata ou ferro, somente ser matria que existe, tem massa e ocupa lugar no espa?o.    Bem, isso  outra histria que faz parte de uma teoria particular...

A origem da palavra tomo remonta da Grcia antiga. Os antigos filsofos gregos teorizaram que, se voc dividisse um objeto sucessivamente, chegaria a um ponto em que n?o mais seria possvel a divis?o. A este ponto chamavam de tomo.    A despeito de seu minsculo tamanho, o tomo  uma complexa combina??o de componentes ainda menores. O diametro de um tomo  da ordem de 10-8 cm, enquanto que o de seu ncleo  de cerca de 10-12 cm. Algo equivalente a compara??o entre os tamanhos de uma formiga e do Maracan?.    Essencialmente o tomo consiste de um ncleo, em torno do qual h uma regi?o dita eletroesfera. O tomo contm um ncleo composto por prtons e nutrons, com eltrons girando ao seu redor. Numa simples gota d'gua, existem cerca de    6.000.000.000.000.000.000.000 de tomos.    No ncleo est?o os prtons e os nutrons, ambos genericamente chamados de nucleons. Os prtons possuem carga eltrica positiva, enquanto que os nutrons n?o possuem carga eltrica. Ambos possuem massa, praticamente, iguais. O ncleo se encontra no centro do tomo com os prtons e neutrons ligados.    As cargas eltricas dos prtons e dos eltrons, em valores absolutos, s?o iguais e, em nome da neutralidade eltrica do tomo, o no. de prtons no ncleos  igual ao no. de eltrons que giram em torno do ncleo.    Na publica??o "O que voc deve saber sobre Energia Nuclear", editada pela CNEN, o Prof. Aristides Pinto Coelho assim introduz o conceito de tomo.    Se voc dividir um fio de cobre, desses que servem para as instala??es eltricas de sua casa, em partes cada vez menores, obter, sempre, peda?os de cobre. Mesmo que voc use um microscpio e continue a observar sucessivas divis?es, o fio de cobre sempre dar peda?os menores de cobre. at onde voc obter cobre? A menor parte de cobre que voc pode obter, caso voc consiga dividir o fio,  chamada de tomo de cobre.    O tomo  t?o pequeno e tem propriedades t?o especiais, que voc n?o conseguir v-lo. Quanto mede um tomo? Na extens?o de 1 milmetro cabem 10 milh?es de tomos dispostos um junto ao outro.    Para voc fazer melhor idia das diminutas dimens?es dos tomos, calcule que uma bola de gude de 2 centmetros de diametro contm cerca de 25 setilh?es de tomos! Isto quer dizer que se pudssemos ampliar um tomo at s dimens?es da bola de gude, o diametro desta passaria a medir, na mesma propor??o, 2 mil km, medida maior do que a distancia do Rio a Salvador.    O tomo  a menor partcula caracterstica de um elemento. Assim, existe o elemento ferro e, portanto tomos de ferro, o elemento oxignio e, portanto, tomos de oxignio, etc. Para cada elemento h seu tipo especial de tomos, que  definido pelo no de protons contidos no seu ncleo at?mico.( Esse no  tambm chamado nmero at?mico Z.)    Sendo t?o diminuto, o tomo , por sua vez, formado por vrias partculas muito menores e que tm grande utilidade para ns. S pode ser decomposto em suas partculas componentes por processo muito especiais e, quando tal ocorre, o tomo perde suas caractersticas. Assim, por exemplo, a energia eltrica, que acende a luzes em sua casa, que lhe permite ver televis?o, que move trens, e tem inmeras outras utilidades no mundo moderno,  fornecida por milh?es de pequenas partculas, que existem em todos os tomos, cujo nome  eltron.    O eltron contm a menor quantidade de carga eltrica negativa conhecida. Mesmo sem v-los podemos imaginar os eltrons como minsculas partculas sempre acompanhadas de uma onda de radia??o, a qual nos permite demonstrar sua presen?a.    Se voc passar o pente vrias vezes por seu cabelo seco, e, em seguida, aproxim-lo rapidamente de alguns pequenos peda?os de papel picado, voc ver que o pente atrai os peda?os de papel. Isto porque os eltrons que estavam no ar, no pente e nos seus cabelos foram trocados pelo atrito entre o pente e o cabelo, e assim carregados eletricamente, originando uma for?a capaz de atrair os pedacinhos de papel. Os raios, que costumam cair durante as tempestades, s?o formados por um grande nmero de eltrons, quando eles passam de uma nuvem muito carregada (cheia de eltrons) para outra nuvem muito prxima e quase sem eltrons. Quando viramos a chave de igni??o de um caro estamos utilizando os eltrons (ou energia eltrica) produzidos pela bateria do automvel. Vemos, portanto, que os eltrons podem caminhar atravs de certos meios, que s?o chamados bons condutores de eletricidade.    Muitos metais s?o bons condutores de eletricidade, como, por exemplo, o cobre, o ferro, a platina, etc. J o atrito do pente no seu cabelo, ou a solu??o qumica que existe na bateria do automvel, s?o chamados geradores de eltrons. Nem sempre os eltrons est?o livres. Na maioria das vezes eles est?o presos nos tomos. As for?as que prendem os eltrons aos tomos lembram a for?a de um im? que atrai metal.    Na realidade elas s?o mais complicadas, porque os eltrons tm carga eltrica e essa carga eltrica tambm exerce uma for?a no tomo. Experincias realizadas h muitos anos mostraram que existem dois tipos de carga eltrica: a chamada negativa (que  a do eltron, que gira em torno do ncleo at?mico) e a positiva, que existe no prton, que habita o ncleo.    A carga eltrica de cada uma dessas partculas  muito pequena, e para simplicidade de raciocnio costuma-se considerar a carga relativa do prton como sendo +1 e a carga relativa do eltron -1. Como em todos os tomos h sempre igual nmero de prtons e eltrons a carga de qualquer tomo  zero.

8bac1627976c8fad956d758dcd324aa7aa	It belongs to the kingdom Plantae, so it is a plant. Rafflesia is thought to have evolved from photosynthetic plants of the order Malpighiales. They must have gradually lost their stems and leaves as they adapted to the parasitic behaviour. Similar to fungi, individuals grow as thread-like strands of tissue completely embedded within and in intimate contact with surrounding host cells from which nutrients and water are obtained.|`|XYVGATOYaa	i thought they were fungi ^_^|`|n29r3q9taa	they r plants more clearly parasitic plants  i have a strong evidence 4 my opinion  they posses flowers (largest) which is the unique charactor of plants|`|CuMYdQV6aa	Rafflesia's parasitic habit  means that it has no reason to photosynthesise and has therefore lost its chlorophyll. It nevertheless remains a plant as do other parasitic organisms such as Broomrapes (Orobanche species) and saprophytic organisms such as the Bird's Nest Orchid..    Recent genetic research has concluded that Rafflesia is a member of the Euphorbia Family (spurges, etc).
6k8GJBRPaa	The first exoplanet was discovered only a couple of years ago and now we've discovered more then 150 exoplanets, because of improved telescopes. I would say somewhere around 2015, we should be able to see planets like Earth and study the atmosphere.  The distance: between 4 and 100 lightyears.|`|f1beDbKIaa	The nearest stars to us are more than 50 trillion miles (4 light years).  But Kepler is going to look at a tight grouping of 100,000 stars.  I think they're going to be near the center of the galaxy (20,000+ light years).  Distance isn't the issue.  Since it's looking for planets by finding transits, and you only get a transit if the orbital plane of the star's planets happen to line up with us, we expect to see transits only 1% of the time or less.  And, we want to see transits of more than 100 planets so that we can get statistical data on how common planets really are.|`|AA11458280	Four light years is the distance of an earth-like planet.(Guess work).  So far all exo- planets found were not earth-like planet.  I recalled there was a colloquium held at CSU. The speaker claimed that she had worked for years, but did not observe any exo-planet yet.

I'm always open to the possibility of other life in the universe, but as far as anything that looks anything like humans, I'm very skeptical.|`|an1b4pXxaa	Yes there most likely is life on some planet billions of miles away.

It just doesn't make ANY sense that we are the ONLY planet with living multi-celled organisms in space, when there are trillions of other solar systems out there (most every star has one). However, I don't think that we have been visited.     I think it was a clever ruse to allow them to:    A. Get us more interested in space.    B. "Invent" all of the advanced technology that they stole from other people because they deemed the country "not ready" for that advanced of tech yet.|`|sOi98doYaa	As romantic as it sounds, the distance between the planets that could support life to earth - are just far too great.

Have they visited us yet? - No, why would they travel such a long way to fly over the Whitehouse, take some pictures and fly back?? Wouldn't it be easier to just watch all our television broadcasts that we have been sending into space from day one?|`|UopXyztTaa	yes, there will be an alien race somewhere in the universe.    you cannot Dennie the presence of aliens, as our universe is so vast that i dint think humans are able to study it completely even in millions of years, moreover, may be the aliens are being afraid of us due to our stubborn Agnese for getting the knowledge.|`|ggBfHk1waa	Based on the huge number of stars in our galaxy, and the huge number of known galaxies, I find it unllikely our earth is the only place where life has sprouted.  However, I don't think ufo's are them flying here to meet us!

0Yyl68oDaa	Well, American should study science regardless of what other countries do --- since it is in each individual's best interest.  Science and pseudo-science is used to buttress so much of American law, inflate costs on goods, and to restrict freedom --- but far too many Americans --- refuse to think logically about a problem and accept myth because "mathematics and science are too hard."    My reading of history on Sputnik, showed the the American people enmass feared the CCCP --- perhaps because they saw what the Soviets did to Europe and the people there in.  WWII was only 13 before this launch.   Because of the fear, people reacted defensively.  Schools reacted accordingly.    Today, most American may not be able to locate Iran on an unlabeld map.  They do not know enough History to inform them that Iran is Persia, which may be Muslim --- it is NOT ARAB.       American do not fear North Korea or I doubt could find it on a map.  But North Korea could make life costly and ugly for a lot of people.  Their army is quite large and while not the best --- it could do damage to our alley and defense treaty partner South Korea.  They are selling arms to anyone who wants them for cash is another issue.    Science must be taught with logic and a sense of economics.  There is vast amounts of Gold in Seawater.  That is a scientific fact.  It is not worth the investment to extract it --- That is an economic reality.    People must ask Congress to fund items that are both scientifically possible and economically realalistic.   Ethanol from corn can be done but it will never be economical due to the chemistry of corn.  Biodiesel use from Hemp oil is both possible and economical but political folly.    We must get young Americans to learn to reason and stop believing whatever people say.   We need to teach people logical fallacies.  Appeals to authority.  Appeals to ignorance.  are invalid and should not be used as proof of investing.|`|PpWosZsIaa	No, as we launch Satellites all the time.  We have been to the Moon several times. We have put rovers on Mars. We worked with Russia to build The International Space Station.    What this will do is wake us up to the fact Iran is close to, if not already manufacturing Atomic Bombs.|`|nBPstkRBaa	It is a race. It is a kind of awakening, pride and existence and all are subjected to stress, fatigue and complacency.

Or perhaps, it is just plain E.N.V.Y., the first four factors in the huge word called ENVIRONMENT.|`|x5c7hU5jaa	as someone inside Iran! I will say it will more motivate Iran to advance its technology in space field!  but all in all as other ones mentioned also, Iran isn't comparable with US at all! US is far far ahead in science (and I hope it goes further with more and more speed coz it is something about humankind not just US residents even tho will affect em more!)    the technology Iran achieved is for like 60 years ago! (it is a great step for the country itself yet! specially under the heavy sanctions!)  although it would seems like just a few countries can do it! but I believe it's not correct too, since most countries don't think on science as countries just like Iran do! for instance I think it is an easy goal for many countries in Europe but they didn't need to do all the job by him-selves! they think as a union, yo know, so they are not in the list of countries able to launch their own satellites (as called space club!) but I think it's not a problem for many of them dropping an sputnik stuff on earth low orbits!    at last let me add, I'm happy my country did that but I didn't think it have to make worry anyone! I can't understand these boundaries! we are all humankind and we have to help each other to get higher in science and culture to make the life an more beautiful experience for us and future pplz coming! :D  although I believe here's some harsh sentences from Iran government but it is so weak coz it is not supported by people in country and will be removed by time goes, nations are not enemies even about Iran and Israel! it is just government propaganda's!  I just wish someday Iran had a secular government (I believe all the issue about Iran is religion) and wish the world in peace and happy days like past!    oops! sorry for my long story! and sorry for me poor En! ^.^|`|ZwRZgJIKaa	hahah nope, we laugh at them, they are only what 60 years behind us|`|cKzfxE0Zaa	Americans are prideful, but lazy. They don't get kicked into motion until somebody else seems to be about to eclipse them. If China lands people on the moon, then maybe you will see Americans get serious again. Until then they will yawn, drink beer, watch TV, and eat too much.|`|AmZkHfZLaa	Although we should Not laugh on them. And we should respect their attempt and success. I must say we need not worry about it. They are far behind us. We are going at good pace and speed as far as space science is concerned.|`|YdGsp59kaa	Probably not.  In the 1950s an Earth-orbiting satellite was a novel concept.  Nowadays it's commonplace.  For $10,000 anyone can have their own small satellite.  While we always welcome new nations and organizations into the community of spacefarers, but a nation's first launch does not have the same impact it once did.

b1ceb7c8481526a9137bbf36ef3f74aaaa	Points A and C are at the same y-coordinate, meaning they form the base, with point B above them.  Trivially, you can see that segment AC has a length of 4, and point B sits 5 units above them, so the height is 5.  The area of a triangle is 0.5*b*h, where b is base and h is height, and you have both values.  For the perimeter, you need the lengths of legs AB and BC.  You need to use the Pythagorean theorem.  In a right triangle, the length of the hypotenuse c is related to the lengths of the legs a and c by the equation a^2 + b^2 = c^2, or c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2).  Now, when you have two points, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), you can treat the line between them as the hypotenuse where the legs have lengths x1 - x2 and y1 - y2, so that's how you can calculate the lenghts of those legs, and add them to the length of the base, 4, to get the perimeter.

Heron's formula for the area of a triangle with sides of length a, b and c is:     Area = sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}, where s = (a+b+c)/2    NOTE: sqrt = square root for short.

3d325475e542ac5712143c84d6b6a42faa	Debiste haber preguntado sobre el invento del lapicero ese si me lo saba.|`|e441630cd899d58f9a5276795cfeb8dcaa	La cerradura fue inventada en China hace ms de 4,000 a?os, si bien poco despus era empleada en Egipto y Babilonia. Este invento se generaliz en un perodo corto de tiempo, puesto que, en el mundo antiguo, se han encontrado cerraduras desde el Japn hasta Escandinavia.     El primer cerrojo que se conoce es un dispositivo egipcio fabricado en madera, encontrado con su llave en las ruinas de Nnive, en la antigua Asiria. En cuanto a su construccin, es el prototipo del cerrojo de cilindro moderno.     Esta tcnica, tan antigua como universal, consista en inmovilizar un pasador en un bloque fijo, en medio de pitones mviles. Para abrir, la llave se introduca en o bajo el pasador, era elevada y sus pitones penetraban en los alojamientos de la cerradura, que entonces retrocedan en la caja.     Bastaba con que un pitn de la llave fuera demasiado corto o largo para que el pestillo no pudiera retroceder. Tenamos ya la imposicin de una "altura de tallado" exacta, ni demasiado alta ni demasiado baja, para una llave perfecta. Esta nocin iba a perderse despus por mucho tiempo.     Fue en el principio de la cerradura egipcia en el que Linius Yale se inspir en 1860 para su cilindro de pitones.     Los arquelogos han datado en ms de 4,000 a?os las cerraduras encontradas en el templo de Sargon en Khorsabad, en la tumba de Luxor o representadas en los frescos de Karnak. Cerraduras similares se fabricaron en Zanzbar; frica, en las islas Faroe al norte de Escocia, en Nueva Guinea y otros lugares del mundo.     Los etngrafos han encontrado en toda el frica Negra, desde Argelia hasta Zaire, en Asia y en Oceana, numerosas variantes de las cerraduras egipcias, incluso fabricadas en el siglo Veinte.     Los cerrojos y las llaves tambin se mencionan en el Antiguo Testamento. Los griegos ya usaban cerrojos de dise?o simple.     Sin embargo, la cerradura y la llave metlicas son una aportacin romana. Los romanos crearon asimismo un sistema de seguridad en los cierres: la vuelta de llave. Son los creadores de la "miniaturizacin", pues consiguieron disminuir el tama?o de las llaves de forma sorprendente. Algunas, minsculas, cerraban las cajitas donde los romanos guardaban los venenos destinados a sus adversarios polticos o sentimentales. Se atribuye tambin a los romanos la introduccin del candado, aunque segn parece fue inventado mucho antes en China.     Numerosos museos conservan colecciones enteras de llaves romanas de bronce o de hierro. Pocos, sin embargo, disponen de cerraduras completas.     Las que se han venido a llamar cerraduras "romanas", aunque hayan sobrepasado ampliamente los lmites geogrficos e histricos del Imperio Romano, funcionaban por deslizamiento de la llave. El pestillo, inmovilizado por el saliente de un muelle, liberaba hasta que la llave, atravesndolo, levantaba ese muelle. Poda entonces, desplazndose, arrastrar el pestillo con ella.     Aqu un mnimo estaba impuesto tambin para la llave, ya que si uno de sus dientes era demasiado largo, no abra.     Se han encontrado en las ruinas de Pompeya tales cerraduras y llaves, pero tambin una llave reducida, posiblemente una llave maestra o una ganza de apertura. Esta tcnica permite, en efecto, a una llave menor que la verdadera, abrir.     En el medievo los artesanos dise?aron cerrojos con un detalle exquisito, aunque los relieves y perforaciones no tenan a menudo relacin con su funcionamiento. Sin embargo, con la excepcin del desarrollo del cerrojo de pestillo, poco se hizo para mejorar el rendimiento y conveniencia de los cerrojos hasta finales del siglo Dieciocho.     En el siglo Diecinueve se mejor el cerrojo de pestillo. Se inventaron y perfeccionaron los cerrojos de palanca o clavija, los cilndricos o de dientes de clavija y los cerrojos sin llave.     Con el tiempo las llaves fueron evolucionando. Cambiaron sus dise?os y sus formas, ofreciendo cada vez ms seguridad y algunas hasta se hicieron numeradas y, supuestamente, las cerraduras eran inviolables.     El desarrollo posterior se ha centrado en la produccin en serie, la mejora de los materiales y el incremento en la complejidad de los mecanismos de funcionamiento.     La electrnica irrumpi en el mercado de las llaves y aparecieron las cerraduras codificadas. Los creadores de software dise?aron un tipo de llave que denominaron "password" o "contrase?a", que es la clave o llave que algunos programas tienen para poder ingresar en ellos.     Las cerraduras se han utilizado para proteger propiedades, como las de las puertas de casas, comercios y oficinas; para guardar valores, como dinero y documentos en las cajas fuertes; para esconder secretos, como las de los cajones o diarios personales; para ejercer poder, como los antiguos cinturones de castidad; para cumplir con el castigo de la ley, como las de las crceles, entre otros muchos usos.     Las llaves tambin tienen una carga simblica en nuestra vida cotidiana. El que tiene las llaves tiene el poder, ya sea el carcelero de un penal, el portero de un edificio o el encargado del llavero general de una oficina.     En otras ocasiones, las llaves son smbolo de exclusividad o status, como las que abren el acceso a un club social o a una zona exclusiva de una oficina, que puede ser desde un rea restringida por seguridad hasta el ba?o de mujeres. Tambin proporcionan privaca, como las llaves de la habitacin de un hotel o del casillero personal en un centro deportivo o de trabajo.     Para un hijo que por primera vez recibe las llaves de su casa, este hecho representa todo un acontecimiento en su vida. En a?os anteriores, esto vala toda una ceremonia, en la que se consideraba que el o la joven se transformaba en un ser responsable.

Los cerrojos y las llaves tambin se mencionan en el Antiguo Testamento, y los griegos y los romanos usaban cerrojos de dise?o simple. En el medievo los artesanos dise?aron cerrojos con un detalle exquisito; los relieves y perforaciones no tenan a menudo relacin con el funcionamiento. Sin embargo, con la excepcin del desarrollo del cerrojo de pestillo, poco se hizo para mejorar el rendimiento y conveniencia de los cerrojos hasta finales del siglo XVIII. En el siglo XIX se mejor el cerrojo de pestillo, y se inventaron y perfeccionaron los cerrojos de palanca o clavija, los cilndricos o de dientes de clavija y los cerrojos sin llave. El desarrollo posterior se ha centrado en la produccin en serie, la mejora de los materiales y el incremento de la complejidad de los mecanismos de funcionamiento.

UZ8wsmuFaa	Pack animals have to have better communication.    Dogs and wolves use their tails a lot to talk in pack.    Mobile Pack hunters who evolved to man killed off more intelligent competitors (farmers?) who lived in smaller family units.    Solitary hunters may need to be smarter but their language skills talking to peers need not be so good. Language skills to communicate with prey etc may still be strong.    Cats have higher verbal skills than dogs. Non verbals may be higher in dogs.    Cats talk to prey. Cats talk with other cats to define hunting areas. Cats usually hunt alone.|`|ku2tP4eEaa	No.  First thing, no animal is intelligent.  There is no method of measuring intelligence in an animal.  Intelligence associated to animals is purely subjective and relative.  Because the only animal known to be intelligent is Homo spaiens.    Both techniques work for those species involved.  The thing that matters is success.  Success is measure as catch per unit of effort.  A solitary predator can have less success, because it does not have to kill as often.  Pack animals have to kill more frequently because of the numbers that require food.    Animals existing now have succeeded within its ecosystems because the have adapted for the best possible survival.  Therefore no predator has any great advantage over another.  Regardless of techniques.    Here is an interesting article about predator-prey relationships comparing wolf and cougar.  http://www.westernhunter.com/Pages/Vol04...|`|AA11058044	Indeed, there are many measures for the cognitive abilities we lump together as "intelligence".  Humans in general tend to be very good at all of them, but they're not necessarily at the same levels in all critters.    One type of intelligence is problem solving, or cognition - when presented with a novel environment, an animal with high problem solving ability has a better chance at working out a technique to achieve success.  This type of intelligence tends to be higher in solitary or semi-social predators than in pack hunters.  Cats, foxes or the semi-social ravens and coyotes tend to be better at it than wolves or hyenas.  But it's not an absolute.  The best critter (other than humans) at this type of cognition is the pack hunting dolphins.    Another type is social intelligence - the ability to read other animals, interact and communicate with them.  This is where pack animals exceed.  It's not just amongst themselves either, it extends to reading other animals as well, and anticipating their movements - making pack hunters far more successful when hunting herd animals.  Wolves and lions excel at this, but the true masters are dolphins.    In terms of caution when exploring new situations, solitary hunters can often seem more intelligent - even if it's not really true.  Dogs and wolves tend to have a much higher incidence of running into things like porcupines, skunks, leg-hold traps and other hazards than a cat would.  This is because the dog typically expects his pack to back him up, so he can afford to be a little more aggressive when encountering new situations.  He knows if he screws up, there's help nearby.  But if a solitary cat gets even a minor injury, he's screwed, and so tends to face unknown danger with stealth and running away.    All of this mostly applies to mammals, which tend to have selected for a higher metabolism and higher intelligence in general.  In birds, there's not really any pack hunters - the most intelligent birds are those who exploit a wide variety of resources: ravens, crows, and also parrots.    Even in mammals, beyond the hunters those critters with omnivorous diets also tend to be more intelligent - they need to be able to figure out what's good to eat at different times, and how to get it.  So pigs, raccoons, bears, and humans all tend to be even more intelligent than our social structure would indicate.|`|BTk2yLqbaa	I agree that pack hunters are more intelligent. In his recent chapter on tyrannosaurs, Greg Paul expressed doubts that T. rex was a pack hunter because its brain was basically just reptilian. It takes intelligence to hunt cooperatively. Lions can do it, snakes cannot. Lacking much brains, many solitary hunters do indeed rely more on instinct.

Cuando una persona se realiza el anlisis de colesterol en sangre, el resultado expresa una cantidad la cual proviene de ;    1-  aproximadamente un 20 % de ese valor de la ingesta, es decir, de lo que consumes.    2- aproximadamente un 80 % de ese valor proviene del propio metabolismo, ya que el hgado es capaz de sintetizar ( fabricar) una molcula de colesterol a partir de cualquier otro resto de molcula ( sea o no grasa) que contenga al menos dos tomos de carbono.    Esta posibilidad de sintetizar colesterol que tiene el organismo se debe a que el colesterol es esencial para el organismo, ya que es usado por el sistema nervioso , la sangre ( forma parte de la membrana de los glbulos rojos), el sistema endcrino ( es base de numerosas hormonas), etc.    Lo malo es cuando supera cierto niveles es sangre y el excedente es depositado en las paredes de los vasos arteriales, conformando junto con los triglicridos ( otro tipo de grasa o lpido) una placa denominada ateromatosa que disminuye la luz de la arteria, forzando al corazn a trabajar ms para que la sangre circule por la zonas con placas.

c6e80e682d3b7af91b9f6aecd2a2ecd8aa	Flatulncia (do latim: Flatus, sopro), ventosidade anal que pode ser ruidosa ou n?o. Tem origem dos gases que s?o ingeridos juntamente com a comida e, minoritariamente, dos gases acumulados durante o processo de digest?o dos animais, na etapa de decomposi??o dos resduos organicos dentro do intestino. Um desses processos  a fermenta??o de carboidratos por bactrias. A intensifica??o da flatulncia pode ocorrer em pessoas ansiosas, que falam ao comer ou que comem muito depressa, ou em pessoas que sofrem de parasitoses intestinais.    Um dos gases provenientes da digest?o que emana pelo orifcio anal (ou anus),  o metano (ou Gs-dos-pantanos, Hidreto de metila) de densidade 0,722 g/dm3, portanto, mais leve que o oxignio, tendendo sempre a subir rapidamente. Este  uma gs facilmente inflamvel, incolor e contribui 21 vezes mais do que o dixido de carbono para o efeito estufa.    Em pases de lngua portuguesa, mais especificamente no Brasil, a flatulncia  chulamente chamada "pum" "peido" "traque" ou "bufa".|`|3e2c063cdd6f54139d0088a1beae9ff0aa	se eu n?o me engano tem metano na composi??o|`|f167f3c656ec63d611a4ae86f2619bd0aa	As Quais Voc N?o Tinha Pra Quem Perguntar.    1. O que  o flato? Do que ele  feito?  Flato, do latim flatus, significa sopro e  uma composi??o de gases altamente varivel, expelida pelo anus.  formado por parte do ar que engolimos, que  quase s nitrognio e dixido de carbono, pois o organismo absorve o oxignio, e gases resultantes das rea??es qumicas entre cido estomacal, fluidos intestinais e flora bacteriana. Ou seja, dixido de carbono, hidrognio e metano.    2. O que faz os peidos federem?  O odor dos peidos vem de pequenas quantidades de sulfeto de hidrognio (gs sulfdrico) e enxofre livre na mistura. Quanto mais rica em enxofre for sua dieta, mais desses gases v?o ser produzidos pelas bactrias no seu intestino e mais os seus peidos v?o feder. Pratos como cebola, couve-flor e ovos s?o notrios por produzirem peidos fedidos. Feij?o, por exemplo, produz grandes quantidades de peidos n?o necessariamente fedidos.    3. Por que peidos fazem barulho?  Os sons s?o produzidos pela vibra??o da abertura anal. O som depende da velocidade da expuls?o do gs e de quanto estreita for a abertura dos msculos do esfncter anal.    4 . Quanto gs uma pessoa normal produz por dia?  Em mdia, uma pessoa produz cerca de um litro de peido por dia, distribudo em cerca de 14 peidos dirios. Pode ser difcil para voc determinar o volume dos seus peidos dirios, mas voc pode estimar quantas vezes peida.  Pense nisso como um pequeno experimento cientfico: anote tudo que voc come e conte o nmero de vezes que voc peida. Voc pode inclusive anotar sobre o fedor deles. Voc descobrir uma rela??o entre o que voc come, quanto voc peida, e quanto seus peidos fedem.    5. Quanto tempo leva at que o peido chegue ao nariz de algum?  Isso depende das condi??es atmosfricas, umidade e velocidade do vento, alm da distancia entre as pessoas tambm. Os peidos tambm se dispersam e sua potncia nauseante diminui com a dilui??o. Condi??es excepcionais existem quando o peido  liberado numa rea pequena e fechada, como um elevador um quarto pequeno ou um carro, porque essas condi??es limitam a quantidade de diluente possvel (ar) e o peido vai permanecer numa concentra??o perceptvel por mais tempo, at que se condense nas paredes.    6.  verdade que algumas pessoas nunca peidam?  N?o. Se elas estiverem vivas, peidam. Pessoas podem peidar at mesmo algumas horas depois de mortas.    7. Homens peidam mais que mulheres?  Mulheres peidam tanto quanto homens. O caso  que os homens tm mais orgulho disso.    8. Em que parte do dia um "gentleman" est mais sujeito a peidar?  Durante a manh?, quando estiver no banheiro. Isso  conhecido como "trovoada matinal". Se o gentleman conseguir uma boa ressonancia, ele pode ser ouvido na casa inteira.    9. Por que feij?o faz as pessoas peidarem tanto?  Feij?o contm a?cares que seres humanos n?o conseguem digerir. Quando esses a?cares chegam em nossos intestinos, as bactrias fazem a festa e produzem um monte de gs. Outros produtores notrios de peidos s?o milho, pimenta, repolho e leite.    10. Um peido  mesmo s um arroto que saiu pelo lado errado?  N?o, a frase "arroto  um peido maroto que subiu de elevador"  puro folclore. Arroto vem do est?mago e tem composi??o qumica diferente de um peido. Peidos tm menos ar atmosfrico e mais gases produzidos por bactrias.    11. Para onde v?o os peidos quando voc segura eles?  Quantas vezes voc segurou um flato, pretendendo solt-lo na primeira oportunidade apropriada e depois descobriu que ele tinha "desaparecido" quando voc estava pronto? Ele saiu lentamente sem a pessoa saber? Foi absorvido pela corrente sangnea? O que aconteceu com ele?  Os mdicos concordam que o peido n?o  nem liberado nem absorvido. Ele simplesmente volta para os intestinos e sai depois. Isso reafirma o fato de que os peidos n?o s?o realmente perdidos, e sim adiados.    12.  possvel mesmo "acender" peidos?  A resposta  SIM. Normalmente os puns incluem metano e hidrognio, ambos s?o gases inflamveis. Entretanto, voc deve estar avisado de que colocar um peido em igni??o  perigoso. N?o s a chama pode subir de volta para seu clon, como a sua roupa e o que estiver ao redor pode pegar fogo.  Cerca de 25% das pessoas que o fizeram queimaram as bordas e os cabelinhos do anus. Peidos tendem a se traduzir em chamas azuis ou amarelas.    13. Por que as meninas n?o assumem seus peidos?  Acho que voc deveria come?ar dizendo que somente algumas meninas n?o assumem seus peidos. A raz?o  cultural. Elas s?o ensinadas a pensar que peidar n?o  coisa que uma dama fa?a.  um grande erro pensar assim. Todas as pessoas praticam a emiss?o de gases anais, inclusive a Rainha Elizabeth e suas damas.    14. Cheirar peido deixa "chapado"?  N?o se conhecem agentes intoxicantes na flatulncia.    15.  possvel enlatar um peido para uso posterior?  Teoricamente sim, mas h uma srie de problemas logsticos. Voc pode tentar usar um saco plstico ao invs de uma lata. Voc pode usar o seguinte como uma experincia de feira de cincias: peide em vrios sacos plsticos e os vede com cuidado. Ent?o encha outros sacos com ar normal. Espere 6 horas. Ent?o eleja voluntrios para cheirar o contedo dos sacos e verifique se eles conseguem dizer se o que tem ali dentro  peido ou  ar. Isso vai te dar a informa??o se  possvel estocar peidos. Se voc fizer na banheira e se inclinar de forma que seus peidos emirjam como bolhas na sua frente e n?o por trs, voc pode pegar as bolhas numa garrafa e ter peidos puros dentro de garrafas, sem estarem contaminados com ar atmosfrico.    16.  estranho gostar de peidar?

BASICALLY, EUROPE WAS SPLIT INTO TWO THE WEST (NATO) AND EAST (WARSAW PACT).  MILITARY BUILDUP ON BOTH SIDES GREW CONTINUOUSLY UNTIL THE END OF THE COLD WAR.     THEN WHEN THE IRON CURTAIN FELL AND COMMUNISM FAILED IN 1989, EUROPE REALLY BECAME A LARGE CONFEDERATION UNDER THE NEW EUROPEAN COMMON MARKET.  DEMOCRACY WAS FLOODED ALL THE WAY PAST WARSAW AND INTO RUSSIA.  IN 1994 I WAS IN PRAGUE THE CZECH REPUBLIC AND THEY ALREADY HAD A K-MART IN THE TOWN SQUARE! IT WAS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN OUR TRADITIONAL K-MART MORE LIKE A SAFEWAY OR A RALEYS SUPERMARKET.  NEW MARKETS  AND TRANSPORTATION OPENED FOR THE EAST.    ANYWHO, AS TIME PASSED AND THE EURO DOLLAR HAS BEEN ISSUED, A STRONGER UNION OF THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES ARE BINDING CLOSER TOGETHER THAT MAY EVENTUALLY FORM A UNITED EUROPE SOME YEARS TO COME.      MANY NEW CHALLENGES FACE MODERN EUROPE;  IMMIGRATION HAS INCREASED, SPECIFICALLY FROM THE MIDDLE EAST, ECONOMIC DIVERSITY HAS BEEN CHALLENGING BETWEEN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN EUROPE.  TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT HAS INCREASED,  THERE IS JUST SO MUCH ABOUT THESE EVENTS...TOO MUCH TO LIST.    HOW IT HAS REMAINED THE SAME, THAT I KNOW OF:    EACH REGIONAL AREA HAS MAINTAINED ITS OWN LANGUAGE AND CULTURE.

The "Jerk" is a function defined as the rate of change of acceleration with respect to time. A literature search on the "Jerk" was constructed under the constraints of the availability of resources. The literature search lead a path in the direction of experimentally obtaining the characteristics of the function, "Jerk".    A specially designed apparatus containing a mounting assembly, an EDR-1, and a test bridle was used to gather the raw data required to study the characteristics of the unknown function, "Jerk". This complete assembly was attached to an I Beam located in the ceiling of a building. By attaching the assembly to the ceiling it enabled the apparatus to free fall until its full length was achieved, thus causing a " Jerk".      The raw data obtained from the free fall of the apparatus contains graphs of the triaxial acceleration. This experimental data acquired from the drops will be analyzed in the future to study the characteristics of the "Jerk".

As que crescem mais, come?am-se a deformar na parte de baixo, porque a press?o do ar puxando para cima na queda come?a a conseguir contrariar a tens?o superficial que a tenta manter esfrica. Quando o raio excede cerca de 4 mm, o buraco interior cresce tanto que a gota, antes de se partir em gotas mais pequenas, fica com uma forma que quase parece um pra-quedas: a forma de um saco de paredes finas voltado para baixo, com um anel mais grosso de gua em roda da abertura inferior.  As gotas de chuva s?o muito maiores do que as gotculas das nuvens que s?o geralmente menores que 15 mcron de tamanho e podem ficar suspensas no ar por muito tempo. Como s?o muito maiores e mais pesadas, as gotas de chuva n?o ficam suspensas no ar e d?o origem  precipita??o."

ossCVxPqaa	The five isomers of hexane are:   hexane,   2-methylpentane,   3-methylpentane,   2,2-dimethylbutane,   and 2,3-dimethylbutane.   They are constitutional isomers because they each contain exactly the same number and type of atoms, in this case, six carbons and 14 hydrogens and no other atoms. For conventional, stable, organic molecules it is necessary that each carbon atom forms four bonds to other atoms and each hydrogen atom forms only one bond. With these "rules" it is fairly straitforward to see that all molecules containing just six carbons and 14 hydrogens will have the following things in common:     A contiguous carbon skeleton and..   Hydrogens will only be bonded to carbons.   With this in mind, constructing all of the isomers of hexane can be accomplished by first ignoring the hydrogens and determining all the unique carbon-carbon bonding arrangements possible with six carbons. Those are:               C-C-C-C-C-C     hexane   ....C  ....I  C-C-C-C-C    2-methyl pentane      .......C          .......I  C-C-C-C-C  3-methyl pentane      ....C  ....I  C-C-C-C  ....I  ...C     2,2-dimethyl butane    ...C,,C  ....I...I  C-C-C-C  2,3 dimethyl butane    Once that is done then bonding enough hydrogens to each carbon such that each carbon possesses exactly four bonds will require 14 hydrogens in each case and give you the completed structures of all the isomers of hexane. For simplicity I did not depict the possible cyclic and poly-cyclic ring structures because those would require fewer than 14 hydrogens to fulfill the four bond requirement for carbon and thus those are not isomers of hexane.|`|797Bf914aa	Here is how:    http://jchemed.chem.wisc.edu/JCESoft/cca...|`|tNSeFGTLaa	1)c-c-c-c-c-c                     2)...c...........  ......|..................  c-c-c-c-c.............    3....c..c...............  ......|...|...............  ...c-c-c-c...........  4.....c..............  .......|................  ....c-c-c-c-c.............  5.....c.....................  .......|............................  ....c-c-c-c..............................  .......|.........................  .......c........................

JuYzmXIpaa	I'm assuming you can use any trigonometric theories, as long as they are proven:    the first theroy i will use is the following:  sin^2x + cos^2x = 1    This comes from the properties of right triangles and pythagorean theorem.    let's draw a right triangle:  call the base, b.  call the height, y and call the hypotenuese, h.  call the angle between the base and hypotenuse to be x.    so:  cos(x) = b/h,  sin(x) = y/h    let's use pythagorean theorem:  b^2 + y^2 = h^2    now, let's plug in what we know into sin^2x + cos^2x = 1    (y/h)^2 + (b/h)^2 = 1  (y^2/h^2) + (b^2/h^2) = 1  (y^2 + b^2)/h^2 = 1  y^2 + b^2 = h^2    This is proven from the pythagorean theorem and thus:  sin^2x + cos^2x = 1    The second trigonemtric theorem i will prove is:  sin(90-x) = cos(x)    this can be proven using the difference angle identity of sin(x+y) which states:    sin(x-y) = sinxcosy - sinycosx    therefore:    sin(90-x) = sin90cosx - sinxcos90    since cos90 = 0 the second term disappears, and sin90 = 1, so first term is cosx    therefore:    sin(90-x) = cosx    voila    I hope these theroems satisfy what you can use.  I hope you understand the proof, as it is sometimes difficult to write on here without pictures, haha.  good luck

Some plants have extensive root systems near the surface so it can suck up every drop of water that falls on the ground. Others have thick waxy parts that keep the water in. Other plants slow down thier respiration during dry season and some only respirate at night when the air is cooler and the plant is more likely reabsorb the water lost during respiration. Many species have thorns or spines to prevent animals eating the plants, and often times the parts of the plant that store water have the most thorns or spines. Others have a chemical defense against herbivores. And some species of plant remain dormant until the rains come, often times you would see greening or flowering after a rainstorm in a desert. And there is one type of plant native to the Sahara desert that looks like a pebble while it is dormant (often times for years) and then when it rains it could  photosynthesize and bloom and then shortly afterwards will become dormant again.
AA6Aq94vaa	Temperate zones have warm and dry seasons,with a defined winter and summer. This is because during the summer, the temperate zone will get direct sunshine and the winter it will receive sunshine received at an angle.   The tropics are always warm, sometimes one season is slightly warmer than the other, but often that has more to do with cloud cover than direct sunshine. The Tropics get direct sunshine all year long.  However most tropical zones have wet and dry season, even in rain forests one season is often wetter than the other.

I do not do homework, I show you how.    Look at the first equation    Au + LiF ->    Au is a metal in the 0 oxidation state; Li is a metal in the +1 oxidation state; F is a nonmetal in the -1 oxidatin state.      Now ask yourself "What can possibly happen?" and go from there.    Clearly Au cannot combine to form AuF because Au has a normal oxidation state of +2; in principal this means you could consider formation of AuF2.   For this to happen, Au in the 0 oxidation state has to become Au in the +2 oxidation state or has to lose 2 electrons.  To lose 2 electrons, where would they go?  The answer has to be the reduction of Li from +1 to Li in the 0 oxidation state.  How can this happen?  Can it happen?

K6QlFoo0aa	First you want to find the limits of the integral.  They will occur when the two functions are equal, so let's set them equal to another and solve the equation.    sin (x/2) = x^2 - 2x    The first solution is 0.    Since the sine can never be greater in absolute value than 1, our choices for the second point of intersection are limited.  A real solution would require power series, so lets try for an educated guess.  When x = 1, sin (x/2) = sin(/2) = 1, but x^2 - 2x = -1, so that doesn't work.  Let's try 2.  When x = 2, sin(x/2) = sin() = 0 and x^2 - 2x = 4 - 4 = 0.  So that's the second point of intersection and the limits of the integral are 0 and 2.  Since y = x^ - 2x is a parabola it can only intersect a sine curve in two places.    Now we have to determine which function is greater than the other from 0 to 2.  Since any one point will tell us what we need to know, let's go back to x = 1.  sin(x/2) = sin(/2) = 1 and x^2 - 2x = 1 - 2 = -1, so it's sine curve that is above the parabola.    So the integral is:    2   sin(x/2)) - x^2 + 2x dx  0    For further insight look at the graph that I have uploaded to photobucket.  Click on the following link:    http://i369.photobucket.com/albums/oo133...    The graph makes guessing 0 and 2 a lot easier. :D  --------------|`|fbhC7VJ1aa	you should define the limits of the integral first  the equation y=x^2-2x has the roots  of x=2 and x=0 so it cuts the x-axis at the coordinates of (0,0) and (2,0)  the equation y = sin(/2*x) passes through the origin both when x=0 and x=2 so you can set up the integral as from 0 to 2 (sin(/2*x) dx

6pUzzsuhaa	first off, there's many many factors that affect farming    --- weather- its one of the MAJOR things in Ag- it can make or break a farmer, like if 1/4 inches of rain can be the difference of a farmer going into debt or not    --- the crop he/she plants- there's a higher demand for certain crops than others, so that boils down to the amount of profit the farmer would make  (this part of the crops they plant and the soil relate)  there's also crop rotation- where one year a farmer will grow soybeans and the next they'll grow something like cotton- farmers use crop rotation to put nutrients back in the soil that were used up by the previous crop    --- the soil- the soil contains nutrients that the plants use to certain there's also different types of soil, some are better for holding water than others too. say a farmer planted cotton this year, and next they'll plant soybeans or peanuts- the soybeans or peanuts will put back certain nutrients that the cotton used/absorbed. and its vica-versa too    --- economy- if the economy is good, the farmer will make more money, the worse the economy is doing, the less the farmer will make   also, it determines how expensive things are that are needed to run a farm- diesel fuel, seeds, fertilizer, herbicides, pesticides, etc..     --- the state he/she farms in- some states have warmer weather than others, like say Georgia farmers would have warmer weather than say Montana farmers. so, with warmer weather, that means a longer growing season and also, in the South (its a good example) the winters are not as harsh as they are up North, so that means that a farmer could also have a crop growing during the winter.    --- political- either national or state wise- but nationally: subsidies- where the gov't pays the farmer not to grow a certain crop, and with out it, that would cause a lot of hardships for the farmer. with both- state and national- taxes are a biggie- there's a tax on basically everything, and the higher the tax, the less money that goes into the farmers pocket. also, with both again- which herbicides and/or pesticides are "legal" to use and things like that   also, for livestock farmers, political like PETA and other organizations like that- they are getting more and more people to become vegetarians/vegans so that means less meat is consumed by the country, so that means that the livestock farmer will have to produce less, thus that again means that the farmer will be losing money      a farmer can easily have a million dollars go thru his hand in a year  (meaning that a farmer can easily spend that much in a year)|`|Z7ZE1lAJaa	Weather is a big one  not enough rain or to much rain and/or heat could be a disaster.  cultural/economic could be a factor like when Oprah made the proclamation on TV about never eating beef again.

X4EBNoNUaa	since you are using boric acid as the acid and tris as the base..the buffer will have a pH ~ 9ish. So to ~ 800 mL of water ( high quality DI)  add 54.5 grams TRIS, 27.5 grams boric acid mix well to dissolve. Add  4.36 grams of disodium EDTA....continue stirring to dissolve. After dissolution is complete  check pH it should be slightly above pH 9 ...adjust with NaOH as necessary. To the solution add in four portions 10 grams of agarose ( for electrophoresis )..allow to swell for 10minutes then , bring to 1 liter, heat to effect dissolution ..do not boil. Once the agar is a clear suspension allow to temper before casting gels.

In any case, frequency for a wave is velocity over wavelength, so that's:    freq. = v / (lambda) [units are 1/s or "Hertz" / Htz / Hz]    If we're dealing with light, obviously we only need the second equation because light  moves at a constant speed, c.|`|91a38ad319ec95dc51dd94dc5bad6fabaa	frequency will be speed divided by wavelength..

O estado slido  caracterizado pela grande organiza??o (ou baixa entalpia) das partculas (tomos ou molculas) que comp?em um corpo nesse estado. Nesse estado, por exemplo pode-se verificar pelos processos adequados que as partculas podem se organizar em formas volumtricas hexgonais, cbicas, enfim.  O estado gasoso  caracterizado por uma completa desorganiza??o (alta entalpia) e uma movimenta??o completamente catica e aleatria de suas partculas, da os gases terem a propriedade de ocupar todo o volume do recipiente que os contm.  Os lquidos s?o uma situa??o intermediria (mdia entalpia), por isso os lquidos assumem a forma do recipiente que os contm porm n?o podem ocupar todo o seu volume.  O vidro  o que chamamos de slido amorfo, sua estrutura interna n?o apresenta a alta organiza??o de um corpo slido e apesar de n?o ser perceptvel a menos que utilizemos equipamentos de medida de alta precis?o, ele escoa, sendo considerado um lquido extremamente viscoso.

8c042f63d2f7e0de4a2b551a8095ad06aa	Hiya    Thats a very good question!!    The reason you can't is that your own mass increases in direct proportion to the speed you are travelling, so you would not be able to move forward in the rocket as you approached the speed of light, your mass and that of the rocket would increase and thus prevent it.    Looked  at another way you know that nothing moves faster than the speed of light - it  is impossible beacuse of the relative increase in mass (of any object). That law applies to all things and you couldn't hide inside a rocket and run forward to cheat physics, you would simply be another object slowed down by your mass. (It would make no difference to physics whether you were an inanimate object (a rocket) or a person.        However at lower speeds where your mass does not increase you would be correct.|`|3b0083d3c1ba4bf8a6df4abdf7bc532caa	Well - first of all, you wouldn't be in a rocket travelling AT the speed of light, as that is not possible.  However, you could be travelling at very nearly the speed of light, relative to an outside observer.  As far as you are concerned, though, you may as well be in a stationary frame of reference.  The whole point of relativity is that everything is relative - there is no fixed, absolute frame of reference. So - speed of light relative to what?    Anyway, let's suppose you start walking.  As far as you are concerned, in your frame of reference, you are moving at 4 mph relative to the rocket.  That, added to the speed of the rocket as measured by your observer, may well be more than the speed of light.  BUT, the observer would not see you walking at 4mph - you would appear to him to be walking much more slowly than that, and your resulting velocity, as measured by him, would still be less than the speed of light!  From the observer's point of view, time is actually running more slowly for you than for him.  Your clock is running more slowly than his, and this is what allows these two speeds to appear to sum together to give a speed less than the speed of light, when you think it should be more.  And - weirdly - when you return from your trip, less time will have passed for you than for him, and you will have aged less than he will.  This is predicted by the theory of relativity and has been observed in the increased lifetime of particles in acclerators, that have been taken up to speeds approaching the speed of light.|`|zeCa91reaa	AS PER PHYSICS YOU ARE TRAVELLING FASTER THAN LIGHT|`|8db59c4158864e2f59935c110e6721d3aa	i don't think you would be... because in relation to the rocket, you are travelling at the pace you walk, and if u jumped up, (providing the rocket stayed at the same speed) you would land in the same place, simply because you, yourself, is not moving. But to be honest, I'm not sure myself  hope that makes some sense|`|f23ea95030dabde7a21ead69752ee92eaa	The answer seems to be that the time slowing effects and the fact that space itself shrinks close to the speed of light, will not permit you to travel faster than the speed of light. As you move faster and faster, you will be covering less and less distance in more and more time. Hence your speed will never exceed the speed of light.|`|74209f509512526a7c775597bcd23f8eaa	The entire rocket as a whole is moving at that speed, so as you walk forward you are still moving at the same speed. You are thinking your speed is added to the rocket's speed - it is not. you are traveling at a lower speed in relation to the rocket, but the rocket as a whole is moving at its speed so is everything in it, even objects in motion inside the rocket. For you to travel faster you would bust out the front of the rocket, for you to travel slower you would bust out the back of the rocket.    Keep in mind speed is relative so you are walking only when compared to the rocket, but all of you are one when viewed from Earth and beyond.|`|AA10103147	Even approaching the speed of light is an impossibility. By the time you have gotten to where you are describing matter will not exist. If you have conquered the physical barrier to get to that point, then your question won't be a factor.|`|UppSUs2Baa	i guess because you're still inside the rocket which is travelling at the speed of light, whereas if you were walking towards the front of the rocket outside and then jumped over the rocket in front maybe then you were moving faster than the speed of light?!?     Or maybe because you're not actually moving at the speed of light, the rocket is?!?    Sorry stupid answers but it is intriguing.|`|yU3xCbgjaa	what if you're traveling at light speed and you turn on your headlights, would anything happen? could the light be going twice the speed of light?

Isso tem a ver com os saltos quanticos que os eltrons fazem quando se fornece energia. Quando um eltron absorve certa quantidade de energia, salta para uma rbita mais energtica. quando ele retorna a sua rbita original, libera a mesma quantidade de energia, na forma de onda eletromagntica (luz).    Ok, o que acontece  que cada tomo tem um conjunto diferente de tomos fazendo com que cada elemento seja nico! No caso do sdio excitado a luz liberada  amarela e isto  uma identidade do elemento sdio (somente o sdio tem luz amarela!).    Outros exemplos:  - estroncio (Sr): vermelho  - cobre: verde  - Potassio: violeta    Resumindo a missa: o Na emite luz amarela devido aos saltos quanticos dele quando se fornece energia.

A Rede Globo levou ao conhecimento do pblico brasileiro, em 2004, uma reportagem produzida pela EPTV Central, com a simula??o feita por computador da melhoria de resistncia do grafite do lpis, projeto desenvolvido em parceria pelo LIEC e a Faber Castell, uma das principais empresas do ramo em todo o mundo.  Nesta oportunidade simulou-se a estrutura do grafite a partir de uma cole??o de lpis. Nesta simula??o foi demonstrado como o grafite risca o papel produzindo a grafia. Levou-se em conta a estrutura correta do grafite e deu-se tambm a idia de como esta estrutura fica organizada na superfcie do papel.    2) Riscar estar diretamente ligado ao conceito de dureza ( sempre o objeto mais duro que risca). O papel, por exemplo, "arranca peda?os" do lapis apos um atrito, porque ele  mais duro que o grafite. A dureza n?o depende da densidade, uma vez que o objeto mais duro existente  o diamante, que n?o  sequer um metal (os metais s?o os materiais mais densos).    e mais esta:  Essa  uma tpica pegadinha de ensino mdio: Quem risca quem?   Aquele que tem maior dureza em rela??o ao outro  que vai riscar. Aquele menos duro vai aos poucos "se despeda?ando".   No caso do lpis e da folha de papel: quando passamos um lpis, estamos passando sua grafita na folha. Vemos que ficam marcas provenientes desse grafite. Isso significa que o grafite est se desfazendo e, aos poucos, vai acabar pois o papel  mais duro e est riscando sua ponta.   Mas veja que se fosse o grafite, por exemplo, que riscasse o papel, ao invs de vermos rastros de carbono proveniente da ponta do lpis, veramos parte do papel sendo rasgado e nada de marcas.    * prefiro a primeira vers?o,  parece mais coerente.    Sobre o vidro:  O que  vidro?   O vidro  um produto inorganico de fus?o( passagem de uma substancia do estado slido para o lquido) que tenha sido resfriado em condi??es rgidas, sem que ocorra mudan?a novamente de seu estado.    Do que  feito o vidro?   O vidro  feito de areia, barrilha, calcrio, alumina e caco de vidro   Como o vidro fica colorido?   S?o adicionados aditivos especficos para a colora??o.  ?mbar (carv?o, sulfato, hematita)  Verde (cromo)  Azul (cobalto, cobre)  Rubi (ferro, cobre)   Como o vidro  fabricado?   As matrias-primas (areia, barrilha, feldspato etc.) s?o misturadas e levadas ao forno  uma temperatura de 1500o C, transformando-se em uma massa de vidro.

O zero absoluto  um conceito no qual um corpo n?o conteria energia alguma. Todavia, as leis da Termodinamica mostram que a temperatura jamais pode ser exatamente igual a zero Kelvin; este  o mesmo princpio que garante que nenhum sistema tem uma eficincia de 100%, apesar de ser possvel alcan?arem-se temperaturas prximas de 0 K.  Propriedades    A temperaturas extremamente baixas, nas vizinhan?as do zero absoluto, a matria exibe muitas propriedades extraordinrias, incluindo a supercondutividade, a superfluidez e Condensa??o de Bose-Einstein. A fim de estudar tais fen?menos, os cientistas tm trabalhado na obten??o de temperaturas cada vez mais baixas. At 2004, a temperatura mais baixa obtida para um condensado Bose-Einstein era de 450 pK, ou 4,5 10-10 K.

A hiptese de que a matria  constituda de tomos foi lan?ada em 1803 pelo qumico ingls John Dalton e evoluiu desde a condi??o de "teoria heterodoxa" at a aceita??o por toda a comunidade cientfica, j nos primeiros anos do sculo XX. O tomo indivisvel de Dalton, que lembrava vagamente o atomismo dos filsofos gregos Leucipo e Demcrito (sculo V a.C.), sofreu grandes mudan?as ao longo do sculo XIX e j n?o parecia t?o maci?o no incio do sculo XX.     As origens da no??o da divisibilidade do tomo podem ser remontadas  descoberta da radioatividade no uranio, pelo francs Henri Becquerel, em 1896. A polonesa Marie Curie e seu marido, o francs Pierre Curie, pesquisaram a fundo o novo fen?meno e descobriram vrios elementos qumicos novos muito radioativos (como o rdio, o pol?nio e o trio), demonstrando que a radioatividade n?o era privilgio do uranio. Mostraram tambm que as partculas que constituam alguns tipos de radia??o provinham do interior dos tomos. Enquanto isso, em 1897 o ingls John Joseph Thomson demonstrava a existncia de partculas muito menores que os tomos, mais tarde chamadas eltrons. A indivisibilidade dos tomos estava em xeque.     Os detalhes da estrutura at?mica foram determinados durante as dcadas seguintes. A divisibilidade do tomo foi confirmada experimentalmente ao longo da dcada de 1910 pelos trabalhos de Ernest Rutherford e Frederick Soddy, que culminou com a descoberta do ncleo at?mico em 1911, por Rutherford. Nos anos seguintes foi solidificada a convic??o de que os ncleos eram compostos de partculas com carga eltrica positiva, chamadas prtons, e partculas sem carga eltrica, chamadas nutrons. Os eltrons movem-se ao redor do ncleo. Como os eltrons s?o bem mais leves que os prtons e os nutrons, o ncleo contm quase toda a massa do tomo. A existncia dos nutrons teve que esperar at 1931 para ser confirmada em laboratrio, por James Chadwick.     As pesquisas penetraram cada vez mais no amago da matria.  compreens?o da estrutura geral do tomo seguiram-se as pesquisas sobre a estrutura do ncleo. Ao longo da dcada de 1920 reconheceu-se que as partculas do ncleo eram mantidas juntas por uma for?a nova (proposta por Werner Heisenberg em 1932), mais poderosa que todas as outras conhecidas, hoje chamada de "for?a nuclear forte". As for?as nucleares fortes s?o tambm responsveis pela emiss?o de alguns tipos de radia??o.     Porm, para usar a nova for?a para gerar energia era necessrio descobrir um modo de produzir radioatividade artificialmente. Isso foi obtido em 1934, com os trabalhos dos franceses Frederick e Irene Joliot-Curie, esta filha de Pierre e Marie Curie.     O processo fsico fundamental para a gera??o da energia nuclear, a fiss?o nuclear, foi descoberto por Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner e Fritz Strassman, em 1938-9. Quando o uranio  bombardeado por nutrons, os ncleos dos tomos absorvem as partculas e tornam-se instveis, partindo-se em dois peda?os espontaneamente. O tomo de uranio cede lugar a tomos mais leves, como brio e cript?nio. A energia correspondente s for?as nucleares que uniam os peda?os  subitamente liberada na forma de energia cintica (energia de movimento) dos fragmentos.     Alm dos ncleos-fragmentos, a fiss?o produz tambm dois ou trs nutrons. Ao atingirem os tomos de uranio prximos, os nutrons s?o absorvidos por eles e os levam  instabilidade, provocando novas fiss?es e novos nutrons, que v?o provocar novas fiss?es em novos tomos e assim por diante, numa rea??o nuclear em cadeia.     O prximo passo seria aprender a estabelecer uma rea??o em cadeia controlada, para que pudesse ser usada na gera??o de energia - ou seja, a inven??o do reator nuclear. Entretanto, os acontecimentos polticos que se seguiram levaram as pesquisas  dire??o inteiramente oposta. Pouco depois da descoberta de Hahn, Meitner e Strassman, eclodiu a Segunda Guerra Mundial (1939-1945). Os estudos sobre energia nuclear desviaram-se irresistivelmente para a constru??o de armas nucleares. Nos Estados Unidos, o Projeto Manhattan, cujo setor cientfico foi liderado pelo fsico Robert Oppenheimer, usou a rea??o nuclear em cadeia para explodir a primeira bomba at?mica perto do laboratrio de Los Alamos, em 1945. A segunda e a terceira caram sobre Hiroxima e Nagasqui, no Jap?o, selando a vitria norte-americana na guerra.     O Projeto Manhattan envolveu vrios dos melhores talentos da Fsica, como o italiano Enrico Fermi, o alem?o Hans Bethe e o hngaro Leo Szilard. Aps a guerra, Oppenheimer tornou-se pacifista e lutou contra o uso das armas nucleares, sendo perseguido pelo governo norte-americano. Outros fsicos do Projeto Manhattan tiveram trajetria semelhante, como o australiano sir Mark Oliphant (1901-2000), falecido no ltimo dia 17 de julho, na Austrlia. Os cientistas renegados do Projeto Manhattan n?o foram os nicos a serem colhidos pelas malhas da poltica belicista dos anos 30-40. Lise Meitner e Albert Einstein, por exemplo, tiveram que fugir da Alemanha para salvar suas vidas, pelo simples fato de serem judeus.     Aps a guerra, as aplica??es pacficas da energia nuclear finalmente puderam ter o seu lugar, com a constru??o de reatores para usinas nucleares. O primeiro reator nuclear foi construdo pelo fsico italiano Enrico Fermi j em 1942.

Imagem obtida pelo Telescpio Espacial Hubble mantendo a camara aberta por 10 dias em uma regi?o aparentemente sem estrelas do cu.  Aparentemente a primeira pessoa que reconheceu as implica??es cosmolgicas da escurid?o noturna foi Johannes Kepler (1571-1630), em 1610. Kepler rejeitava veementemente a idia de um universo infinito recoberto de estrelas, que nessa poca estava ganhando vrios adeptos principalmente depois da comprova??o por Galileu Galilei de que a Via Lctea era composta de uma mirade de estrelas, e usou o fato de que o cu  escuro  noite como argumento para provar que o universo era finito, como que encerrado por uma parede csmica escura.     A quest?o foi retomada por Edmund Halley (1656-1742) no sculo XVIII e pelo mdico e astr?nomo Heinrich Wilhelm Matt?us Olbers (1758-1840) em 1826, quando passou a ser conhecida como paradoxo de Olbers. Olbers tambm descobriu os dois asterides (planetas menores) Palas (1802) e Vesta (1807).     O problema  o seguinte: suponha que as estrelas estejam distribudas de maneira uniforme em um espa?o infinito. Para um observador em qualquer lugar, o volume de uma esfera com centro nele aumentar com o quadrado do raio dessa esfera (dV = 4R2 dr). Portanto,  medida que ele olha mais longe, v um nmero de estrelas que cresce com o quadrado da distancia. Como resultado, sua linha de visada sempre interceptar uma estrela seja l qual for a dire??o que ele olhe.     Uma analogia simples de fazer  com uma floresta de rvores. Se estou no meio da floresta, a meu redor vejo as rvores bem espa?adas entre si, mas quanto mais longe olho, mais diminui o espa?amento entre as rvores de forma que no limite da minha linha de visada as rvores est?o todas juntas e nada posso ver alm delas.          Como o brilho das estrelas cai com o quadrado da distancia (demonstrado por Johannes Kepler em seu Optica em 1604), enquanto o nmero de estrelas aumenta com o quadrado da distancia, o cu em mdia deveria ser t?o brilhante quanto a superfcie de uma estrela mdia, pois estaria completamente coberto delas.     Mas obviamente n?o  isso que vemos e, portanto, o raciocnio est errado. Por que?   Algumas propostas de solu??o:     1. A poeira interestelar absorve a luz das estrelas.     Foi a solu??o proposta por Olbers, mas tem um problema. Com o passar do tempo,  medida que fosse absorvendo radia??o, a poeira entraria em equilbrio trmico com as estrelas, e passaria a brilhar tanto quanto elas. N?o ajuda na solu??o.     2. A expans?o do universo degrada a energia, de forma que a luz de objetos muito distantes chega muito desviada para o vermelho e portanto muito fraca.     O desvio para o vermelho ajuda na solu??o, pois o desvio  proporcional ao raio do Universo, mas os clculos mostram que a degrada??o da energia pela expans?o do universo n?o  suficiente para resolver o paradoxo.   3. O universo n?o existiu por todo o sempre.     Essa  a solu??o atualmente aceita para o paradoxo. Como o universo tem uma idade finita, e a luz tem uma velocidade finita, a luz das estrelas mais distantes ainda n?o teve tempo de chegar at ns. Portanto, o universo que enxergamos  limitado no espa?o, por ser finito no tempo. A escurid?o da noite  uma prova de que o universo teve um incio.     Usando-se a separa??o mdia entre as estrelas de 1 parsec, e o raio mio como o raio do Sol, de 700 000 km, obtm-se que o cu seria t?o luminoso quanto a superfcie do Sol se o Universo tivesse um raio de 2 1015 parsecs, equivalente a 6,6 1015 anos-luz. Como o Universo s tem 13,7 bilh?es de anos, a idade finita do Universo  a principal explica??o ao Paradoxo de Olbers.|`|45a1157ca9029054724edf6398ffe032aa	a resposta da vera lcia parece suficiente para responder a sua - e tambm minha dvida. mas s "parece", pois essa quest?o  uma das que mais intrigam a fsica moderna. a proposta do tal paradoxo ainda n?o esclarece satisfatoriamente o mistrio.|`|pflbgq6Maa	Ns recebemos a luz solar diretamente,  claro que  durante o dia.  noite temos a luz tambm do sol, porem essa chega por reflexo da lua.

Do you see that Matrix A has 3 columns?    Do you see that Matrix B has 2 rows?    Does 3 = 2?  No, right?    This guarantees that you will reach the end of a row and the bottom of a column at the same time when you multiply.    So, in this case, you cannot multiply Matrix A by Matrix B.    Guido
uPdwGSP7aa	Honda Cost = 25 * Days + .24 * Miles  Toyota Cost = 31 * Days + .19 * Miles    Since distance = 110 miles one way, you could do a round trip in a single day, so Days = 1, Miles = 110 one way and 220 round trip.  One Way   Honda Cost = $51.40 (Cheaper)  Toyota Cost = $51.90  Round Trip  Honda Cost = $77.80  Toyota Cost = $72.80 (Cheaper)    To find the breakeven mileage, set the two costs equal to each other, so:  25 * Days + .24 * Miles = 31 * Days + .19 * Miles  since Days = 1, this becomes  .05 * miles = 6  or miles = 120    For 2, here's a real life example:  You are working for Radio Shack as a sales person.

0bdd6ca4ce7c1b5b10f90bb7bed987f4aa	I don't have much time and I suppose you need the answers, not a qualitative point, but the only real-life comparison here is this:  the value of a lower payment (in that it leaves more money for any purpose they might have) but which they could achieve by drawing down on the investment when needed vs. the fact that the freed up money can only return 6% while the paid down loan would effectively earn 9.5% by reducing interest paid. Essentially, this is the better investment (9.5% vs. 6%). Unless the investment has some expected return rate other than the 6% mentioned (i.e.:  the existing investment and the investment method that returns 6% are not the same) AND higher than 9.5%, they will earn more by taking it down and paying down the mortgage whether as a down payment or as a later payment against principal.    Practical concerns other than this include keeping a reserve against unexpected reverses and the variability of many investment returns, making it hard to assess a return on the original investment that is close to the 9.5% vs. the certainty of the 9.5% return on house loan.
AA10023818	1/16.    Your tree diagram will have two nodes at the top:  boy first, girl first.    Under each "boy first" and "girl first" you'll have "boy second" and "girl second", for four nodes in the second level.    Under each of those four nodes, you'll have "boy third" and "girl third", for eight nodes on the third level.    Under each of those eight nodes, you'll have "boy fourth" and "girl fourth", for sixteen nodes on the fourth level.    You'll have sixteen paths in your tree diagram, and only one of the sixteen goes boy - boy - boy - girl.  This demonstrates that the probability is 1/16.    Note:  If the question were "three boys and one girl IN ANY ORDER" the answer would be 1/4 instead.  (Because three additional paths -- girl - boy - boy - boy; boy - girl - boy - boy; boy - boy - girl - boy -- involve three boys and one girl.

En primer lugar cuando corremos el corazn bombea la sangre en consonancia con el ejercicio que hagamos y su intensidad. ?verdad?. Una razn por la que el corazn se acelera y bombea la sangre tan rpido al hacer ejercicio, significa que ese musculo necesita de riego sanguineo y oxigenacin optimos para evitar lesiones.  Con un estimulador de impulsos, el cozarn ni se entera de que el msculo se est moviendo (puesto que son movimientos totalmente inconscientes y no los provocas tu, sino una mquina) y entonces no manda el incremento de sangre necesario apra el msculo que est haciendo ejercicio.     Las contraindicaciones de esto son bsicamente el riesgo de fracturas fibrilares y roturas musculares al realizar un esfuerzo. Esto pasa evidentemente porque aunque el musculo sea estticamente cojonudo, es una bazofia funcional puesto que no ha sido nutrido como es debido.     La comodidad que se persigue hasta para hacer gimnasia, es acojonante La gimnasia y el ejercicio fsico tiene que ser impepinablemente aerbico Cualquier cosa que te vendan para hacer ejercicio fsico sin sudar, duda de su calidad y de sus resultados.     ?Lo nico que podra aconsejarte? No uses compementos  novedosos de dudosa reputacin porque el que lo va a pagar eres t.   Despus de un ejercicio como hacer natacin, gimnasio intensivo, y actividades que esculpen tu cuerpo, podras usarlo por el unico hecho de que los msculos ya estn oxigenados y el riesgo de lesiones disminuye solo sensiblemente.     Las lesiones en los msculos llegan en cuando menos te lo esperas. Conque... si tratas a tu cuerpo con intiles formas para perder peso y eres tan jodidamente vago como para que una mquina haga el trabajo que tienes que hacer tu, podrs tener una lesin a los 3meses, a los 3a?os o a los 3 das. Esto no avisa.   Ah! y las lesiones musculares son mas graves y dolorosas que las oseas. Que lo sepas.     No soy partidario de mquinas que hacen el trabajo que debe hacer una persona. Es insano.

"La beaut est dans les yeux de celui qui regarde" Oscar Wilde.|`|4eb571c939277be88f0084d237b62228aa	La couleur des yeux est dtermine par l'abondance d'un colorant brun-noir, la mlanine, dans la partie antrieure ( l'avant) de l'iris de l'?il (l'iris, c'est la partie colore de notre ?il). Les personnes aux yeux bleus ne possdent pas de mlanine dans cette partie de l'iris (elles en ont quand mme un peu dans la partie plus profonde). L'?il appara?t alors bleu pour la mme raison que l'eau profonde nous appara?t bleue. L'iris disperse la composante bleue de la lumire plus que les autres couleurs qui sont partiellement absorbes. L'iris semblera alors bleu puisque c'est surtout le bleu qui sera rflchi.    Le gne des yeux bleus empche presque totalement la formation de mlanine  l'avant de l'iris alors que le gne des yeux bruns permet l'accumulation du pigment  cet endroit.    Le gne responsable de la coloration dominante de l'?il (gne appel EYCL3) est situ sur le chromosome 15. Il existe en deux varits : la premire dtermine la couleur brune et noire et la seconde varit la couleur bleue.    Un autre gne situ sur le chromosome 19 ( gne EYCL1) intervient aussi dans la dtermination de la couleur. L'allle dominant de ce gne dtermine la couleur verte alors que l'allle rcessif dtermine la couleur bleue.    D'autres gnes interviennent dans la coloration de l'?il. Entre autres, des gnes qui dterminent la distribution, la quantit totale et le type de mlanine qui se dposera dans l'iris. Ces gnes peuvent donner  l'iris une coloration plus ou moins fonce ou faire appara?tre plusieurs couleurs diffrentes (un pourtour brun tirant sur le bleu vers le centre par exemple ou, encore, un ?il brun prsentant de petites taches bleues ou vertes). L'influence de ces autres gnes peut mme, dans certains cas, expliquer que des parents aux yeux bleus puissent avoir un enfant aux yeux bruns (dans ce cas, l'un des parents aux yeux bleus peut tre porteur du gne des yeux bruns, mais, sous l'influence d'un autre gne, il ne se dpose pas suffisamment de mlanine pour masquer le bleu).    Les nouveau-ns ne possdent pas de mlanine dans la partie antrieure de l'iris mme s'ils sont porteurs du gne des yeux bruns. C'est pourquoi ils ont toujours les yeux bleus. Lorsque le gne des yeux bruns devient actif, le colorant se dpose et l'?il acquiert sa couleur brune ou noire.    Dans certains cas, les yeux peuvent tre de couleurs diffrentes. On parle alors d'htrochromie. Cet tat a le plus souvent une origine gntique. Le gne responsable serait dominant. Les chiens et les chats prsentent souvent cette anomalie. Dans certains cas, l'htrochromie peut rsulter de maladies ou de blessures subies  un oeil.|`|DD7s79LDaa	c'est Dieu qui les a donn ces yeux ont peu meme voir des noirs avec des yeux vert comme le chanteur Lemar ou bien des noirs avec des yeux bleu comme Rihanna ou gris tous c'est la cration divine|`|ASC8MJbDaa	C'est gntique.....Certains genes controllent la couleur des cheveux, la taille....etc. et d'autres la couleur des yeux.    pour en savoir plus :  http://ici.cegep-ste-foy.qc.ca/profs/gbo...|`|8delilLLaa	C'est le taux de mlanine de l'iris qui fait que celui-ci filtre plus ou moins la lumire, et qui dtermine donc sa couleur : plus il y a de mlanine, plus l'iris est sombre.

Spero di esserti stato utile!! bacio!|`|xIeqre4caa	i feromoni sono gli ormoni femminili nel regno animale, e vengono emessi dalle femmine di molte specie per attirare i maschi. tuttavia nell'uomo  stato riscontrato che i feromoni femminili non hanno praticamente effetto sul maschio, in quanto la percezione olfattiva umana  assai minore a quella degli altri animali che ne fanno uso. pertanto quel profumo ai feromoni avr anche un buon odore magari, ma di certo non ti far conquistare nessuno. comunque si, lo possono mettere tutti, i feromoni non sono nocivi n tossici.|`|4da3dd429639aec5cf32b2f5872fcb9caa	ma sn ttt kazzate!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  nn dirmi ke ci credi??????|`|65c7e8cd373e5d15008026758db98355aa	Secondo me sono tutte fregature! E' vero che i feromoni in qualche modo contribuiscono a far scattare l'attrazione fisica, ma cmq non dobbiamo dimenticare che siamo esseri umani e non  di certo un semplice ormone a farci innamorare di un'altra persona.|`|IOb1gH6Gaa	Secondo me il miglior "Profumo" di una donna  il suo Mistero la sua Curiosit ed il suo Sorriso.|`|lf9tleokaa	Dai.........................sono tutte stupidate!|`|pUwgsAXEaa	sembra strano ma puo succedere con tutti i profumi comuni... es. a me  successo con il profumo dolce&gabana.. con la mia attuale ragazza... l'ho conosciuta in  un centro commerciale che inseguiva le scia del mio profumo xke stava uscendo pazza e quando mi a trovato si  subito fatta sotto...! sono 2 anni che stiamo insieme!

Il y a un faisceau d'hypotheses concernant la mmoire mais aucune relle certitude. Il y a la plasticit neuronale, c'est a dire le changement des proprits de certains neurones, la structure du reseau neuronale, certaines protines... Kandel avait mis l'hypothse de protines de type prion, mais pas de preuves solides a ma connaissance.
