fTnSTVriaa	Hi,    As I am a pastry chef I think that it is cool that you are interested in how to do this.  I think the short answer here is, you almost always need to have some sort of material inserted in the cake to make it stand up straight.  I do wedding cakes up to 4 tiers that have to sit in a ballroom for up to 3 or 4 hours.  If you do not have something inside, the cake will invariably lean over at some point. I freeze my cakes and let them thaw a bit before I ice them.  When it is time to stack it up, I insert regular plastic drinking straws down into the cakes and clip them even with the top.   They fill up with the semi-frozen cake and make it quite stable.  (Some people also use pvc pipe as you mentioned, but it is hard to cut to the exact height you need.) When the waitstaff cuts and serves the cake, they remove the straws so people don't even see them.  Also, you asked about a food product that was like wood- would you want to eat that? (hee hee just kidding)  Anyway I hope that this was helpful and good luck!!|`|VPycXVIlaa	Hard candy in rods like that is really brittle actually (think of a broken candy cane). If you don't go very tall you shouldn't need the piping but anything more than a couple layers and you'll start having issues with the layers sliding around.    Good luck!
doz7RIoeaa	It's really just hot sauce so use it on anything you like. There are really no "rules" as to where and how you can use condiments|`|AA12031316	You can make "nuggets" by grilling the sauce on things like mushrooms, green peppers, brocolli, or any other veggie.  My daughter loves it on mushrooms.  Portabello mushrooms hold up very well to cooking or grilling.  You can also make a nice dip with the sauce, and use it for corn or tortilla chips.|`|DFXS4SB4aa	My vegetarian aunt loves to use hot sauce on EVERYTHING. She'll put it on salad, tofu, beans, rice, boca burgers, pizza...everything tastes better with hot sauce to her.|`|tbqgpfCkaa	i used to make buffalo chicken pizzas.  but now i've made them without the chicken and you still get a great buffalo taste.    Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in the microwave and mix it with a third cup of franks red hot (or whatever sauce you want/have).    spread it over a store bought pizza crust ( i use thin/whole wheat)    and the sprinkle cheese on top and bake in the over using the directions on the crust you bought.  you could even put raw tofu right on it before you bake and that would probably  be delicious|`|cz8K0jY3aa	Oh man, buffalo sauce is one of my favorite sauces. It tastes good on a lot of things. I always dip my fries/potatoes in buffalo sauce and I even add some to my ramen noodle soup! It essentially goes well with anything fried and you can even put it on a veggie burger!    Hope this helps!|`|VtqdeSQ8aa	Boca vegan chikn patties & nuggets, celery and carrots.  french fries regular and sweet potato fries  fried tofu  baked potato w/broccoli  potato chips|`|73bc3f33677a0f4fb63d38445d203ec8aa	anything deep fried or perogies.  Move to Pittsburgh.  Everything is covered in wing sauce with a side of Ranch.

IHsuI8mJaa	Make it a co-ed themed party. Like boys wear yellow and girls wear purple. Or themed as in costume. Or a white out or black out party- everyone wear white except you wear a really bright color!!!    Or make it formal. Like dress up.     Or if it's going to be BIG- make it a 'stoplight party' which is where people who are in relationships wear red. People who don't wanna be hit on or are in a complicated relationship wear yellow. And all you single ladies and single guys who wanna get hit on (or even hook up) wear green! :]    Have fun! ?|`|jem0fyhiaa	well i would like if you had a pool have a pool party and have music punch, a rock band you know all the hip stuff!!
UCpAFiwIaa	Health food... it sounds crazy but my body runs best on natual foods, like apples, celery, organic granola, yogurt, 1% organic milk, tofu.... My favorite food has got to be fresh fruit salad. It sounds ridiculous, I know. But try it on a summer day with some vanilla yogurt and wheat germ! ;-) Yummy!     I have to be honest though, when I do treat myself and try other foods... Mexican is delicious! Of fast food places, I have to say I love Panera Bread best of all... nice selection there.    Have a nice day.|`|uJHMddl9aa	Mexican food. My second favorite would have to be asian food.|`|1wNsBNmxaa	hamburgers  pizza  cheeseburgers  french frys  onion rings  lasagna  egg salad  tuna fish sandwich  mexican food yummy  german food  Chinese food        Relic66~~?|`|W2XyyqSAaa	I love Italian food.|`|4cQSsDaZaa	orange chicken with rice and soy sauce and spagetti|`|YlyN73Jnaa	I love cheese and pepperoni pizza, chicken parmesgian, lasagna, and spaghetti with meatballs. I CRAVE ITALIAN FOOD!!!!! I also love burgers, steak, french fries, and beef tacos(hard or soft). Burek is another one of my favorite foods. I'm not sure you've heard of it. It is whole wheat bread or pasta layerings filled with spinach, parsley, onions, feta cheese, and occasionally hamburger. It is a Turkish food. This might or may sound to you like I'm fat and eat a lot, but I'm not and I don't.|`|ILpp3ncYaa	Thai food.|`|AA11402528	chinese|`|PdIRHRZgaa	hamburgers  tacos  spaghetti, garlic bread|`|NEp2RpVBaa	Indian food  Japanese food  Fresh homemade burgers|`|KoJ0rddfaa	MACORONI AND CHEEEESSSEEE!!  my aunt makes it the best. with lots of cheese and bread crumbs on top.    i also love grilled cheese and any other pasta dishes.    oh, and i live in Rhode Island.  so you'd think it be sea food right?  haha.

I make really good Bolgoki, Thai anise star soup, cheese enchiladas and baked spaghetti.
hKlsJgVSaa	It is a pasta. It is kind of teardrop shaped. People also often mistcake it for rice. La Bella is a popular brand. I usually find it on the tops shelves kind of closer to the cous cous then the spaghetti.|`|5zNwBQZHaa	Orzo in the US is small, rice-shaped pasta.  You can find it at most grocery stores with the other pastas.|`|YQTBQ5xyaa	Orzo is a type of pasta.  It looks like rice.  Buy it in the dried pasta section.|`|bv5kbxvUaa	It is rice-shaped pasta....|`|WsUSAgLmaa	It's disgusting, thats what it is!!!|`|AA10371609	Orzo is a type of pasta.  Its shaped like and looks like and functions much like rice in many dishes.  You can find it where the dried pastas are sold at the store.|`|AA12065568	It's a small pasta. It's shaped like rice, but is a bit larger. It's available at most grocery stores in the pasta section. It usually comes in a smaller box and all the stores I've seen it in put it on one of the higher shelves|`|JOwiKhRBaa	its a really tiny type of pasta. it looks allot like rice. you can buy it at basicly any groccery store.|`|XbE75FHiaa	orzo is pasta that looks like short-grained rice.
5zNwBQZHaa	You can pickle any vegetable.   The results will vary from one to another - but they can all be pickled.<br>  <br>  Meat that has been seasoned with a mixture of vinegar and spices is also called "pickled" but it doesn't have the same effect on the meat as it does veg.  Corned beef is an example of pickled meat.<br>  <br>  I know of no one who pickles fruit.|`|QxIhMHwAaa	You can also pickle hard boiled eggs, but for the life of me I don't know why people do, lol...I find it disgusting!|`|aupBzZGfaa	pigs feet or something. haha <br>  <br>  and i once heard of chicken liver?<br>  haha idk if you'd want to eat those, a lot of people think thats weird lol|`|u2xm5RoQaa	any veggies that you can think of are all able to be pickled.|`|eh3UhLX4aa	Onions! and then use them on salads...very very thinly slice a red onion or a Vidalia sweet onion...add enough red wine vinegar to cover (I have a little jar that works perfectly) and add 2T-3T of sugar...let sit for several hours, and then scoop out the onions and use as you wish. Sometimes they just sit in there for days.  Also good to munch -- if you like onions!|`|Z2489k1oaa	Just about anything can be pickeled. Veggies, pork hocks or pigs feet, chicken and turkey gizzards, sausage, eggs, fish. mmmmm.. those are just some things.|`|sG5FKmAYaa	Eggs.<br>  Cabbage.<br>  Onions.<br>  Gherkins.<br>  Beetroot.|`|ILpp3ncYaa	Anything. Now whether it is a good idea or will taste good is the variable.
zMMr72aSaa	Try sending an email to the company who makes Dr. Pepper.  Real NY-style delis usually sell funky sodas like that. Good luck.|`|P0EAzyw8aa	We have it here in Australia at a shop called sugar fix. It was not popular as are a lot of the American sweets  lollies  and drinks are too sickly.

My friends in both London and Liverpool use the Hungarian ones, a tin of Colossal or Super Colossal are 2-3 pounds for a 8 oz tin.|`|5vFGO57Kaa	You should be able to get them in a deli shop or specialist food shop... sorry can't be more specific cos i don't live in London!

K91tfiLCaa	Here are some points you can make:<br>  <br>  1.  The sale of junk food is already banned in California.  Even the sale of junk food for fund raising purposes is not allowed.<br>  <br>  2.  Students are taught in health classes about healthy eating, but if the schools sell junk food, then the school is contradicting what they are teaching.  It is like telling students not to smoke and selling them cigarettes at the same time.<br>  <br>  3.  Students need to eat healthy food in order to be good students. Most students do not eat a good breakfast so they don't have enough energy to make it through the day.  The school needs to provide something nutritious so they will be able to pay attention during class.  Also, many students get much of their nutrition at school.  Junk food should be banned, otherwise, these students will essentially be living off junk food.  It is true that students have a choice, but they will always choose junk food if it is available.<br>  <br>  4.  Schools did not always sell junk food.  When I was a student, there were no vending machines on campus at all!  It isn't right for schools to treat students as a source of income.  Schools are a place of learning, not a 7-11.  (use this one to counter the argument that 'schools need the money')<br>  <br>  5.  The CDC's Coordinated School Health Program has Nutrition Services as one of its eight components:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/HealthyYouth/CSHP/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdc.gov/HealthyYouth/CSHP/</a><br>  <br>  Obviously, selling junk food is not in compliance with the CDC's program.<br>  <br>  6.  The are alternatives to junk food that schools can sell, such as nuts, fruits, and baked chips.  Read this article for more:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.judgerc.org/Nutrition/Articles/junkfoodbanned.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.judgerc.org/Nutrition/Article...</a><br>  <br>  This also counters the argument that 'schools need the money', as well as the argument that Stephanie Vasquez uses in the article.  She seems to think students can only survive on junk food!<br>  <br>  7.  Unfortunately, teenagers have a sense of entitlement and they don't like being told what to do, even when it is good for them.  I know this is an emotional argument, but it will work in a debate.<br>  <br>  Luckily, you have the easier side of this debate.  I would hate to come up with arguments in favor of junk food because every single one of them can be easily refuted.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Giz<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Some of the other answerers seem to feel it is not possible to define 'junk food'.  Here is the definition of junk food used in the California Education Code:<br>  <br>  49431.  (a) (1) Commencing July 1, 2007, at each elementary school,<br>  the only food that may be sold to a pupil during the school day are<br>  full meals and individually sold portions of nuts, nut butters,<br>  seeds, eggs, cheese packaged for individual sale, fruit, vegetables<br>  that have not been deep fried, and legumes.<br>     (2) An individually sold dairy or whole grain food item may be<br>  sold to pupils at an elementary school, except food sold as part of a<br>  USDA meal program, if it meets all of the following standards:<br>     (A) Not more than 35 percent of its total calories shall be from<br>  fat.<br>     (B) Not more than 10 percent of its total calories shall be from<br>  saturated fat.<br>     (C) Not more than 35 percent of its total weight shall be composed<br>  of sugar, including naturally occurring and added  sugar.<br>     (D) Not more than 175 calories per individual food item.<br>     (b) An elementary school may permit the sale of food items that do<br>  not comply with subdivision (a) as part of a school fundraising<br>  event in any of the following circumstances:<br>     (1) The items are sold by pupils of the school and the sale of<br>  those items takes place off of and away from school premises.<br>     (2) The items are sold by pupils of the school and the sale of<br>  those items takes place at least one-half hour after the end of the<br>  schoolday.<br>     (c) It is the intent of the Legislature that the governing board<br>  of a school district annually review its compliance with the<br>  nutrition standards described in this section and Section 49431.5.|`|AA11603468	And whose decision is it to say what is junk and what is not?

Or is it just I know it when I see it.  Some would argue that all food is junk food some would argue that no food is junk food.  Take a chocolate candybar for instance.  Some people would call that junk food.  But to someone who is starving it could be a life saver.  If you are not taking in enough calories a high fat food is vital.

53giV6PFaa	I am Korean and use chopsticks all the time.  I have not heard about crossing chopsticks at the top being rude or offensive, but it is incorrect.  I have even seen people do this.  However, used correctly they do not cross.  Again, if you do it I don't see this as offending at all.    Here is a site on chopstick etiquette especially Japanese.  Crossing chopsticks is not one of the things you shouldn't do according to this site.  Show this to your friend    http://www.justhungry.com/your-guide-bet...|`|us6s78pWaa	Yes it is improper, but if you aren't in a formal dining situation, I really wouldn't worry about it.     Unless, of course, you care about offending any of the Japanese who see you using them incorrectly. If you care about that, then you should probably just work on using them the right way.|`|AA11015885	Cute chopsticks!  Anyway, if your chopsticks are crossing at the top, you are probably dropping a lot of food.  Your friend sounds a little rude.  However it is bad luck to cross chopsticks, a Chinese symbol for death.|`|LMuJMAqfaa	Ok, I'm Asian and I lived in that part of the world my entire childhood and, yes, my chopsticks cross, and no, no one had ever complained.    In my opinion, it's just a matter if you are or aren't able to hold food with it.  I don't think a Chinese superstition should tell you not to have your chopsticks cross because so what if they cross, no one die! Beside, cross chopsticks just look more cool =] (I know how to do both, but i just like them cross better, in my opinion, you would use less hand muscle in other to hold the food if your chopsticks cross, at least the two will stay together and you don't have to worry about keeping them from slipping out of your hand)|`|A8F4HF3Paa	Why not just practice learning how to do it the right way?

AA12012733	What kind of bacon are you buying?  Sometimes you can buy packages of the ends and odd pieces.    Also, if you are buying the thin sliced bacon, it will come apart if you pull it out of the package.    Try buying a package of thick sliced bacon, and see if you still have the problem.  I would think you won't.    Frankly, I've had bacon actually come out of a pkg. in shreds - and it has always been two things:  first, it was super thin slices and secondly, I didn't havea wide enough opening in the plastic covering.    So now I open the package by cutting around 3 of the edges with kitchen scissors. I can pull the resulting flap up, and get a whole slice out easily.  My mother always sliced the bacon  right down the middle.  Yes, it gives you small slices, but they pretty much stay in one strip and not shreds.

IN OTHER WORDS:   just dont drink it more than three times a day  its a good thing your 15 becasue the amount of caffine in that is dangerous for 12 or under.   ask your doc if you're allergic to caffine    RED BULL  A can of Red Bull from the United Kingdom states the ingredients as: Water, sucrose, glucose, sodium citrates, carbon dioxide, taurine, glucuronolactone, caffeine, inositol, niacin, pantothenic acid, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, caramel and riboflavin. In comparison, a can of Sugar Free Red Bull from the United Kingdom states the ingredients as: water, acidity regulator sodium citrates, carbon dioxide, taurine, glucuronolactone, sweeteners (acesulfame K, aspartame), caffeine, inositol, niacin, pantothenic acid, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, thickener xanthan gum, colours (caramel, riboflavin).    Taurine is a naturally occurring organic acid in the human body and is also present in foods like poultry, fish, and scallops. In addition to being an antioxidant, it is mainly used by the body during physical exertion and stress.[2] In its natural form, taurine is derived from animal tissue, having been first isolated from bull (Bos taurus) bile, hence the name "Red Bull"; however, the taurine used in the Red Bull drink is produced synthetically. It is also the first energy drink to list glucuronolactone in its ingredient list. Glucuronolactone is a carbohydrate involved in detoxification. The chemical naturally occurs in the human body, but is also present in foods like grain and wine.[2]      [edit] Brand portfolio  Name Launched Discontinued Notes Picture   Red Bull 1987[3]      Red Bull Sugar-Free 2003[citation needed]     Red Bull Cola 2008[4]  The company's take on a cola beverage, this product has all natural ingredients and is marketed as a natural product.[4] It is available in both the original 250ml cans and the newer 355ml version.[5]     IN OTHER WORDS   stick to 1 red bull a week and you'll be fine  just dont go overboard          you'll be fine  just dont become a couch potato  and every month you should try to go a week without red bull and to check every now and then if you are addicted  its bad if you become addicted|`|GzHCK9TJaa	okay, so as long as you be active all the time  and don't be a lazy fatty,  it'll all be fine.  :)|`|J5Mevbz7aa	definitely not|`|WixVIsFtaa	no, it wont affect you much..at all.  i know some people who drink like 3 monsters a day.  youll be fine.|`|tdJpnyF9aa	you should try Verve!.... it is a really good energy drink... they are very good for you.... but they are a little pricey...

BWxSSADaaa	Rice and beans, baby!  Seriously, I have co-workers from P.R. and it was the first thing they named.  Plantain is also popular.  I visited Puerto Rico a few years back, I remember a few meals well ... at one restaurant there was phenomenal "tortilla soup", although I don't remember actually seeing tortilla strips in there, pan fried fresh caught fish, and tres leches cake.  At another place there was platanos fritos, and boiled grouper, and flan with guava jelly.  The BEST though, was in this whole in the wall place, it was a stick-to-your ribs sort of meal and I'd never had anything similar before: They had cooked and mashed plantains, they weren't sweet.  They made this into a mound, with a depression in the middle, where there was a spicy chicken stew with tomatoes and peppers.  It was FANTASTIC!!!|`|7cUDstdjaa	I sent someone this website last week and got a 'best answer' for it, so suggest that you try this  http://gopuertorico.about.com/od/food/g/...|`|A8F4HF3Paa	Mofongo is awesome.

bqehqlFHaa	I would get two , but get different flavors.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	I've done dessert catering over 30 years; and try to have a variety of fruit, plainer and chocolate desserts.  Assuming the truffles are also chocolate, I would have cream puffs or petit fours or a bundt cake (lemon, orange, strawberry, apple), for people who don't want chocolate or hard biscotti.  Actually, a cherry cobbler would be good to set out with some whipped cream;  and a cheesecake; and a bundt cake (along with the biscotti, brownies & truffles).  That would give you variety in flavors and textures.   For a dessert party, you want extravagance, so don't skimp on what you put out|`|KwLjfwSNaa	At least 500 cakes.|`|OgOCHy9Waa	probobly about 4 or 5, but like make sure they're varied like one plate of fruit, one cake, one plate of cookies, etc...|`|VihV4Troaa	well with biscotti, brownies, and truffles out, i think 2 cakes would be fine if you cut them in moderate slices but 3 would be plenty.|`|o7wGYLZ5aa	2 regular sized cakes.|`|ucQyVlZGaa	Just buy a sheet cake.

AA12012733	All the previous answers are great, but one thing our family does is to use several dfferent cheeses between the noodle layers.  We use a good quality ricotta, grated mozarella, sliced provolone, grated parmesan and grated Romano.    We put two of the cheeses on one of the 3 filling layers (which means 4 noodle layers, ending with one on top).  Use plenty of sauce; a mixture of cooked loose sausage and ground beef also go in the filling layers. Spread more sauce on the top lar of noodles, then sprinkle more grated Parmesan and Romano on top. Cover with foil and bake, roughly 45 minutes to 1 hr.    Good idea to put a baking sheet under the pan, in case the sauce bubbles over.    My oldest son prefers to make his lasagna the night before, let it cool down, then cover with foid and refrigerate overnight.  He says it's better the next day!    Let the lasagna set for a short time to finish setting up.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	FRESH chopped basil, oregano and rosemary .. fresh crushed garlic ... good quality ricotta cheese ... REAL mozzarella (preferably fresh) ... Roma tomatoes|`|ynjrtIdUaa	Garlic cheese toast for dipping in the sauce.|`|hV43wyvJaa	use Italian hot sausage instead of ground beef, ground sirloin, etc. Also, all lasagnas need a good sauce.

It really does make a difference.    This is the recipe I have used many times and it's really good and easy to make.        * 2 tablespoons olive oil      * 3 cloves garlic, minced      * 1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes      * 1 (28 ounce) can tomato puree      * 2 1/2 tablespoons dried oregano      * 2 1/2 tablespoons dried parsley      * 1/4 cup grated Romano cheese      * 1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese      * 2 bay leaves      * 1 teaspoon onion powder    Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Saute garlic until aromatic and tender. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato puree, oregano, parsley, Romano cheese, Parmesan cheese, bay leaves and onion powder. Reduce heat to low and simmer for at least 40 minutes.|`|P0EAzyw8aa	rosemary and chili if you like some zing. cardamon to add some sweetness and salsa and a mixture of cheeses like romano, cottage and parmesan, use a different one throughout the layers.|`|c2ade7b8f2f6c36c47280cd3b5448833aa	Use the highest quality ingredients you can afford and it will taste better: grass feed beef, good italian sausage, a white sauce, a red sauce, homemade lasagna noodles, and good cheese like fontina and parmigiano reggiano!|`|PenbhD1uaa	Roasted garlic, oregano, thyme, basil (fresh if possible).  Also make sure you season everything with salt and pepper.  A lot of people make that mistake or forget.  Another thing I do is to buy sausage fro some of the meat mixture and remove it from the casing because it has really nice seasonings in it too.  A little ricotta cheese mixed with an egg and chopped cooked spinach as one layer, as well as the mozzarella.  I like to use half smoked mozzarella and half regular mozzarella.

I would consider all of that junk food besides the crackers and cheese, pancakes, and granola bars. Oh and if the rice cakes are like those Quakes things, then yes I'd consider them as junk too. As for the pretzels, I don't think I'd consider like the braided honey wheat twists as junk food, but the standard twists, sticks, or rods; yes.  Maybe you'd like to restrict it to like JUNK food, such as ice cream, donuts, cake, cookies and candy,  :) Good luck!|`|alIO8ic0aa	I go by this:<br>  Junk food is an informal term applied to some foods which are perceived to have little or no nutritional value, or to products with nutritional value but which also have ingredients considered unhealthy when regularly eaten, or to those considered unhealthy to consume at all.|`|F9Mrquc5aa	granola should only count if it has chocolate.<br>  pancakes should have no fruit or whip cream and keep the syrup to a minimum.<br>  cheese and crackers dont count come on. <br>  no twinkies no ho hos no little debbie no snack packs no fruit roll ups no ice cream and no jello<br>  <br>  hey just think of it  this way JC fasted for forty days . come on show some respect for petes sake.|`|ILpp3ncYaa	No<br>  No<br>  Yes<br>  If it is air popped, no.<br>  Yes.<br>  Yes.<br>  Yes.<br>  Yes.|`|7joYILriaa	i gave up junk food for lent too! its hard and im only on day two, but i dont consider pretzels junk food, cause they really arent much more then hard bread and salt...im on the fence with rice cakes because they arent really bad for you, but still...chex mis is junk, and i think popcorn is the same as rice cakes...kinda on the fence. Tortilla chips have the word chip in their name, so id def consider them junk..crackers and cheese def isnt...and i eat a granola bar for lunch everyday so i dont think they are junk, unless they are filled with chocolate, or like m&ms, or really unhealthy stuff like that...and pankcakes arent, again if there not filled with chocolate chips...<br>  if ur stuck for what you CAN eat, you can have stuff like peanuts or almonds (any kind of nuts), yogurt covered raisins (that hard yogurt can be a great substitution for chocolate!!), and like fruit (obviously). make sure to stay away from ice cream, donuts, cake, cookies, chips, etc. <br>  hope i helped and good luck!! :D|`|Tryf71mtaa	I would consider Rice Cakes, tortilla chips, Chex mix, and even the granola bar (they're delicious but loaded with sugar) junky foods.

0fuF2sHbaa	I use the leather things I already have, that I bought as a meat eater.     I'll never buy leather again, because that would be giving money to the people I'm against, but using it (or touching it, as some meat eaters claim we can't) isn't going to do any more harm than has already been done.     Vegan = lifestyle. One that is against the exploitation of animals.    Many will argue that buying leather while eating a vegan diet is simply being a strict vegetarian.    Each to their own, I guess.|`|VtqdeSQ8aa	If you follow a vegan diet- maybe, maybe not.    If you follow an "ethical vegan" lifestyle, NO!!!!!!|`|llkSmgLJaa	Vegans don't use any animal byproducts, so leather is a no-no.|`|17c123a043ea813bbdbb18f16c4c2b58aa	Nope. True vegans don't eat any animal by-products (including gelatin), don't buy products that utilize animal testing, don't wear leather, wool, or any other animal product. Also, personally, I include not shopping at a store that sells fur on my list of vegan activities.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	no, vegans don't use those|`|GuXKPVgjaa	It doesn't depend on the person.    If you are a vegan, you don't wear or use leather, fur, silk or wool.  Some people get confused between vegans and strict vegetarians., but a vegan will not use animals products in their lives full stop.    Hope this helps Lt.|`|qYaINCrkaa	It depends on the person, and their reason for becoming Vegan.

PenbhD1uaa	A Red velvet cake is a type of rich and sweet cake, with a distinctive dark red to bright red or red-brown color. Common ingredients include buttermilk, butter, flour, cocoa powder, and often either beets, or red food coloring. It is most popular in the Southern United States, though known in other regions. The most typical frosting for a red velvet cake is a butter roux icing also known as a cooked flour frosting. Cream cheese buttercream frostings are also popular.Traditionalists believe that red velvet cakes must contain cocoa.|`|F4GDR8Acaa	haha i made that today with duncan hines mix.it burned xD. But it tastes really good with butter cream icing. and it has some chocolate in it but it is really not noticable. Also I got it from new york for abotu 6 bucks a slice and it tastes amazing. Trust me you need to try it.. The flavor is extremely hard to explain. I personally don;t taste chocolate at all. I would call it vanilla flavor. wiht some extra flavor. Very hard to describe. But have fun!|`|hHCdXq0Naa	It is NOT a chocolate cake.  It usually has about 2 TB of cocoa powder in the entire cake; and the color comes from red food coloring.  It was invented during WWII, when there was rationing on chocolate.  It doesn't (or shouldn't) have much chocolate or cocoa flavor to it at all.  It's basically a plain cake, and the cream cheese frosting is what most people love about it|`|4fCjH7iWaa	Its chocolate yes. Its made with buttermilk and cocoa. Its very good. The mix they sell is a total disappointment. Red dye does not a velvet cake make. lol|`|AA10928232	um... it's very mildly chocolate.  I think the cocoa is there to deepen the red color, so it's not so bright, but a deep rich color.  If you close your eyes and take a bite, it's not "knock you out" chocolate by any means.    My DH prefers red velvet cake, I think, b/c it reminds him of what his grandmother used to bake him for his birthday.  More memories and warm fuzzies than anything, I suspect.  And they are beautiful!|`|hKNwt8ZLaa	red velvet cake is traditionally flavored with cocoa powder, so it has a hint of chocolate flavor.    a typical recipe contains only a few tablespoons of cocoa, as using much more would create a dark batter and require LOTS of red food coloring (which, in large quantities can have an unpleasant taste) to achieve a red cake.

SQxiGhz5aa	Great country recipe for venison chops:    Bread them with either a flour mixture with salt and pepper, or just use Andy's Chicken Breading either mild or spicy depending on your heat preference.    I am assuming these are cut somewhat thin (1/2" or so?).    Use a heavy skillet (old fashioned cast iron is best, but the newer hard anodized will be okay).    Shallow fry them in your fav cooking oil (vegetable or canola) at about medium high.  Same as you would if you were shallow frying pork chops or something of that nature.  It will only take about 5 mins or so on each side.    Fix white gravy (regular country style biscuit gravy) and biscuits.    Yum Yum Yummy Yummm!    And simple!|`|ynjrtIdUaa	Like a rare steak.

Heat the pan to around 400 degrees and cook 2 minites per side.|`|ax06tFUXaa	When I cook Venison, I like to soak it in Salty cold water in the Refrigerator for a day, this helps with getting the wild taste and blood from the meat. Then, I drain the water from the meat, and cook it like I would a roast, chops, etc.  I like to grill venison chops, but Bar BQ sauce is a good way to cook them, or use yellow table mustard, and Italian Dressing( as a marinate) and then cook them on the grill, or in the oven.  Hope this helped you...and Enjoy your chops!

I used to get it at Whole Foods, and if you have a Greek grocery near you you can definitely get it.  I wouldn't use the cow's milk stuff you can find in most grocery store--namely, I'm thinking of the Athenos brand type stuff.  It just isn't tangy enough to substitute for byrnza.  I've tried sheep's milk feta, it would also be a good substitute.    I think that halusky is just noodles, so the dish should be noodles with brynza cheese ...|`|fZnuyKSZaa	your nearest cheese would be FETA cheese, just make sure its from Ewes milk and not some kind of weird Danish cows milk

Distribute batter evenly between both loaf pans and bake for 45-50 minutes, cool before eating :)    Goodluck, and Enjoy!|`|7NoModJ1aa	When I switched from vegetarian to vegan, I found that it was pretty easy to just remove the egg/dairy from whatever I was used to preparing. That way I didn't have to learn a whole bunch of different recipes and things.     But if you are looking for something specific, I love fixing pasta and putting basic tomato sauce on top of it, with a few Italian seasonings. Or I will fix pasta and toss it with some cherry tomatoes and a bit of Italian dressing. I also love fixing chili - Imagine brand makes a great dairy-free tomato soup, so I just add black beans, corn, diced tomatoes and peppers, rice, and seasonings - bring it to a boil, then let it simmer for 20-30 minutes or so until the rice is done.     If you are looking for some vegan alternatives to eggs and dairy, Ener-G has an egg replacer that is sold in a box. You can use this instead of eggs when you are baking. Silk soymilk is pretty good, but feel free to try a few different types of non-dairy milks (rice milk, almond milk, even different brands of soymilk) to find what you like the best. Tofutti makes sour cream and cream cheese alternatives, and Follow Your Heart Vegan Gourmet makes the best non-dairy cheese that I've ever tried.

Lager and ale are the two types of beer. Lagers are fermented slowly at low temperatures, with yeast that sinks to the bottom. Ales are fermented at something like room temperature, with fast-acting floating yeast. The faster fermentation of ales gives a variety of "fruity" flavors from fermentation by-products; lagers tend to be drier and crisper. Virtually all mass-market American beers are lagers.<br>  <br>  Bitter is an English style of ale, pale, light, and well-hopped. Stout is a style of very dark, opaque  ale, made from dark-roasted malt.|`|NXAk99qWaa	The most common method of categorising beer is by the behaviour of the yeast used in the fermentation process. In this method of categorising, beers using a fast-acting yeast which leaves behind residual sugars are termed "ales", while beers using a slower-acting yeast, fermented at lower temperatures, which removes most of the sugars, leaving a clean, dry beer, are termed "lagers". Lager production results in a cleaner-tasting, drier and lighter beer than ale.<br>  <br>  LAGER:<br>  Lager is the English name for cool fermenting beers of Central European origin (fermented between 7°C and 12°C). Pale lagers are the most commonly consumed beers in the world.<br>  <br>  ALE:<br>  Ales are normally brewed with top-fermenting yeasts. The important distinction for ales is that they are fermented at higher temperatures and thus ferment more quickly than lagers (between 15°C and 24°C).<br>  <br>  -- There are various colours of ale (light, brown, etc). The colour of a beer is determined by the malt. The most common colour is a pale amber produced from using pale malts. Dark beers are usually brewed from a pale malt or lager malt base with a small proportion of darker malt added to achieve the desired shade. Other colourants - such as caramel - are also widely used to darken beers. Very dark beers, such as stout, use dark or patent malts that have been roasted longer. Guinness and similar beers include roasted unmalted barley.<br>  <br>  BITTER:<br>  Hops contribute a bitterness that balances the sweetness of the malt; the longer the hops are boiled, the more bitterness they contribute, but less of the hop flavour and aroma remains in the beer.<br>  <br>  STOUT:<br>  Stout and porter are dark beers made using roasted malts or roast barley. There are a number of variations including Baltic porter, dry stout, and Imperial stout.<br>  <br>  Hopefully this answers your question!<br>  <br>  PB.|`|XwacWyy6aa	Ale - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ale" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ale</a><br>  Stout - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stout" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stout</a><br>  Bitter - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitter_(beer)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitter_(bee...</a><br>  Lager - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lager" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lager</a><br>  You also asked what ber is, well beer is all of these drinks, bitter and stout ect are all subdivisions of beer.|`|2zd9OjeMaa	Ale, lager, bitter and stout are all beers.

hHCdXq0Naa	If you wrap it in foil, the skin will be very soft (and you can rub it with olive oil first too) - but if you like a crispy skin (like potato skins), then do it unwrapped.  You can bake them anywhere between 350 and 425, depending on what else is in the oven, and adjust the time.  If they're large, then 1 hour at 425 is about right - but closer to 1-1/2 hours for 350|`|0F8hauikaa	Conventional or Regular Oven:  Medium-size potatoes   45 minutes at 400 degrees F  60 minutes at 350 degrees F  90 minutes at 325 degrees F.  (cook about an extra 15 minutes for large potatoes.)    Potatoes are done if tender when pierced with a fork.    Of course the quality of the potatoes is important. If you're cooking more than one try to get them close to the same size so they will cook uniformly.|`|AA10928232	No foil.    Scrub your potato  down w/ a scrubby sponge and detergent.  Poke all over 10-12 times w/ a fork.  Set on the outer edge of your microwave oven's turntable, and cook on High for 6-7 minutes.  You can turn over once during cooking (use pot holder!)  You should hear it singing to you when it's done.  Reach in w/ a pot holder, and gently suqeeze it.  If it's not soft and fluffy inside, give it another 1-2 min then check again.  Exact time depends upon size of potato and power of m/w oven, but within 8 min or so you should have a perfectly fluffy baked potato to enjoy.    4 potatoes takes around 13 min.
AA12012733	Apple and Dried Cherry Strudel    Traditional strudel dough is rolled and stretched paper-thin by hand. To save time, use frozen phyllo dough, which is completely prepared and easy to use. Thaw phyllo overnight in your refrigerator for best results when making strudel.    1/2 cup dried tart red cherries  1/2 cup packed brown sugar  2 tablespoons all-purpose flour  1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  3 cups thinly sliced peeled cooking apples      (about 1 pound)  10 to 12 sheets frozen phyllo dough (about       18 x 12-inch rectangles), thawed  1/3 cup butter, melted  1 tablespoon granulated sugar     Pour enough boiling water over dried cherries to cover; let stand 20 minutes. Drain cherries.    In a large mixing bowl combine brown sugar, flour and cinnamon. Add apples and dried cherries; toss gently to mix. Set cherry mixture aside.     To assemble, cover a large surface with a floured bed sheet; unfold phyllo dough. Stack 2 layers of phyllo on the floured bed sheet, brushing between layers with some melted butter. Arrange another stack of 2 layers on the bed sheet, brushing between and overlapping stacks slightly. Add 3-4 more stacks, brushing and overlapping, forming a rectangle about 40 x 18 inches (stagger stacks so all seams are not down the middle). If necessary, trim to a 40 x 18-inch rectangle. Brush with melted butter.     Beginning 4 inches from one short side of the dough, spoon filling in a 4-inch-wide band across the dough. Using the bed sheet underneath as a guide, gently lift the 4-inch piece of dough and lay it over the filling. Slowly and evenly lift the bed sheet and roll up the dough and filling, jellyroll style, into a tight roll. If necessary, cut excess dough from ends to within 1 inch of filling.     Brush top with remaining butter; sprinkle with granulated sugar. Fold ends under to seal. Carefully transfer strudel roll to a lightly greased 17 x 14-inch baking sheet. Bake in a preheated 350 degree F oven for 35-40 minutes, or till golden. Carefully remove strudel from pan.

You can make it as easy or as complex as you like.  Just remember to use meat (ground beef, turkey, pork, lamb, or a combination), filler (crackers, cooked rice, breadcrumbs, uncooked oatmeal etc. [sometimes I use Grapenuts cereal]), vegetables (chopped onions, garlic, shredded carrots, minced celery or anything you like--or none at all!), a couple of eggs (as a binder), spices, and maybe some barbecue sauce, tomato sauce or tomato paste for moisture.  It's really quite fun!  Mix it all together and then cook it until it reaches 160-degrees F. in the middle.  Cooking until it is no longer pink does not work for meatloaf, especially if you use tomato sauce or paste, because they will give the meat a pink hue. Top it with any kind of sauce or gravy you have on hand or know how to make.|`|CQww1c2daa	You can use bread crumbs or bread with it.  An egg would help.

4b045bed7aeb597819a17cafdaf98978aa	I just ate a Kashi brand frozen pizza...you could mimic a homemade version...I thought it was really good!    Mediterranean ingredients included spinach, red peppers, red onion, feta and mozzarella cheeses, red pepper sauce on natural whole grain crust...yum!  And healthy!|`|AA10283080	Buffalo chicken pizza and Bar-b-que chicken are my favorites to make.....I have them in my pizza cookbook!|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	Start here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza    Start with a page on Neapolitan pizza, the original version from Naples, Italy. [Authentic Neapolitan pizzas are made with local ingredients like San Marzano tomatoes, which grow on the volcanic plains to the south of Mount Vesuvius, and Mozzarella di Bufala Campana, made with the milk from water buffalo raised in the marshlands of Campania and Lazio in a semi-wild state]    Lazio Pizza: [Pizza in Lazio (Rome), as well as in many other parts of Italy is available in two different styles: (1) Take-away shops sell pizza rustica or pizza al taglio. This pizza is cooked in long, rectangular baking pans and relatively thick (12 cm). The crust is similar to that of an English muffin, and the pizza is often cooked in an electric oven. It is usually cut with scissors or a knife and sold by weight. (2) In pizza restaurants (pizzerias), pizza is served in a dish in its traditional round shape. It has a thin, crisp base quite different to the thicker and softer Neapolitan style base. It is usually cooked in a wood-fired oven, giving the pizza its unique flavor and texture. In Rome, a pizza napoletana is topped with tomato, mozzarella, anchovies and oil (thus, what in Naples is called pizza romana, in Rome is called pizza napoletana).]    And don't forget Sicilian Pizza: [toppings baked directly into the crust. An authentic recipe uses neither cheese nor anchovies. Sicilian pizza in the United States is typically a different variety of product made with a thick crust characterized by a rectangular shape and topped with tomato sauce and cheese (and optional toppings).]    Add a page on Margherita pizza, which is made with fresh mozzarella, tomatoes and basil.     Have a page on New York style pizza: [style originally developed in New York City by immigrants from Naples, where pizza was created. It is often sold in generously sized, thin and flexible slices. It is traditionally hand-tossed, moderate on sauce, and moderately covered with cheese essentially amounting to a much larger version of the Neapolitan style. The slices are sometimes eaten folded in half, or even stacked, as its size and flexibility may otherwise make it unwieldy to eat by hand. This style of pizza tends to dominate the Northeastern states, and is very similar to the basic style common through the United States and known simply as pizza.]    Then you can go into Chicago style pizza: [Chicago-style deep-dish pizza, contains a crust which is formed up the sides of a deep-dish pan. It reverses the order of some ingredients, using crust, cheese, filling, then sauce on top. Some versions (usually referred to as stuffed) have two layers of crust with the sauce on top.]    And also a page on California or Wolfgang puck pizza: [pizza with non-traditional ingredients, especially those that use a considerable amount of fresh produce. A Thai-inspired chicken pizza with peanut sauce, bean sprouts, and shaved carrots is a popular variant in California-style pizza restaurants, as are pizzas that use chicken and barbecue sauce as toppings.]    Include one on Hawaiian Pizza: [Canadian bacon (or sliced ham) and pineapple toppings with Mozzarella cheese. This type of pizza is especially popular in the western United States, and is also a popular topping combination in Australia, Canada, and Sweden, but notably not in Hawaii.]    You can have a page on frozen pizzas: [English muffin and French bread pizza and pizza bagels are common convenience pizzas made at home in an oven or toaster, usually with a simple topping of tomato sauce, sliced or shredded cheese, and perhaps pepperoni. French bread pizza is sometimes available commercially as a frozen meal.]    And a page on the most popular toppings for pizzas; pepperoni, Italian sausage. anchovies, etc.

VZI8vm3Iaa	Casein is found in all animal milk/dairy products. The easiest way for you to avoid this product is to treat it like a milk allergy. You will need to read every label every time to make sure that a product is safe. Your best bet will be to use fresh food that you control in his diet. You may also want to talk to a nutritionist or dietitian about the diet. Also some grocery stores have list of dairy-free, gluten-free, etc products carried is that particular branch available.    One final note, here is a web page that might be able to get you started. It has a list of casein free products.  http://web.mit.edu/kevles/www/nomilk.htm...|`|AA12031316	Your best bet would be to feed your lil guy only homemade foods, preferably organic, so you control the ingredients.  Casein is a very common milk protein that is in many packaged foods.  Food companies are not required to label 2 percent of ingredients, and casein is often also an unlisted ingredient in the ingredients themselves.  It can be very confusing, and quite dangerous if you don't know where these hidden sources are.  I am highly allergic to milk, and have had to forgo all commercially produced things.  I make everything from scratch.  Its not near as daunting as it sounds.  He is little enough to start him out on a road to good health by making his meals from scratch, using only what you know is safe.  Rice milk is VERY easy to make homemade-just put some cooked rice in a blender with a little fresh water and perhaps a touch of agave nectar for sweetness.  That way, you avoid all of the preservatives and the high price of store bought.  Give the little fella plenty of finger foods-nice colorful, softly cooked veggies and fruits, whole grains (buckwheat, quinoa, millet, and oat groats are awesome, packed with protein, easy to cook, and full of vitamins and nutrition-you can also make "milk" from any of them.  Sorry you have to deal with allergies, but consider it better that you found out now while he is so young.  Its much harder to take foods away from someone after they have grown used to them.   A nutritionist should be able to help you sort out his diet without too much effort-the main thing will be avoiding commercially processed food, since its just too risky.
llkSmgLJaa	The factory that made your clothing, car, washing machine, refrigerator, etc; do a lot more damage to the enviroment then companies that process soy. 100% of the soy bean is used, there is no wast product.|`|GuXKPVgjaa	If they up'd the production of other beans and nuts, then the factories producing them would replace the pollution of soy factories.    Beat thing to do is harvest your own food if you can.    To solve pollution problems it's best not to look at changing foods, but at different ways of creating energy. This is happening, so don't worry about it. Enjoy your soy. :)|`|VPycXVIlaa	Yes. Soy farms are just as bad for the environment as any other factory farms.. They use just as many pesticides and all that. Though it would be really difficult to be vegan without soy as that's where you get a lot of protein. Try looking for organic tofu and other soy products.. at least then they are required to use organic soy which is grown without pesticides.    Good luck!|`|AA12031316	Yes, you can be vegan and not use soy products.  I am highly allergic to soy, as well as wheat and corn, and I still maintain my diet.  I can't say for sure about factories that use soy being bad for the environment, because I simply don't know.  I DO know, however, that soy is near as healthy as its touted to be.  Most soy has been genetically modified to the point that it is no longer a natural food.  It has been spliced with the DNA of all sorts of things to make the crops more hearty and pest resistant.  It contains alot of things you would not otherwise put into your body, such as Bttoxin, scorpion venom, and other gene altering splices.  Soy is the leading cause of adult onset food allergies, due to the GMO process.  There is just far too much controversy surrounding soy for it to be considered a safe food, despite all of the health claims.  I am MUCH healthier now that I have given up all forms of soy.  I had to get more creative with my veg diet, but it can be done.|`|FxAD44Moaa	NO  NO NO NO NO!    come ON!      listen..   all products that are processed are bad and leave a big old carbon footprint!    fast foods, processed junk, snacks..  sodas...   they're the bad guys and yes some processe soy products also.. but that's because of the processing!    no, you are FINE!      soy is the least of your problems..    ok let me spell this moment out..        IE:      soy milk is processed BUT...    the elements in soymilk leave a lesser footprint of waste than say...      cow's milk.      ta  da!      no,   and it doesn't cause gayness,  cancer,  makes men  weak and small and turn women into masculine monsters.    stop listening to the propaganda.    eat your soy.. i've been eating soy for 33 years i'm 6'2'' tall.. i'm 175lbs.. i'm happily married, i have a career of 30 years..   everyone  likes me and i even cook for meatarians.. for one is my wife too.    and i'm happy.    :D    been a strict vegetarian for 33 freaking years and going strong.      eat your soy.. do it for me eh?    and of course for you and your loved ones...    but of course processed anything is going to be not as healthy and leave more junk behind and with all the chemicals is questionable...    that includes  soy based elements... but    it's lesser a problem and still more healthy than dairy from animals...   anything from an animal..    replace it with a soy substitute and you decrease many elements  (but not the nutrition)   including that carbon footprint that everyone seems to be buzzing about these days.    soy milk is better than cows milk in many ways..       soy anything is better.. but watch out for the soy based products that have been processed with dairy.. that's the trick, read those labels.    now, if only they made soy dippy eggs eh?    :D      eat that soy it's a protein that's soluable,  fiber packed and loaded with d, b,  and  calcium vitamins!    and please please,  stop listening to those jerks out there who keep whinign and whining that you are killing yourself because you don't eat  meat products.    OH BOY!    i'm living proof that one will not die being a vegetarian or vegan.    just make sure you eat fresh whole foods!    and try to keep the processed foods down to a minimum.|`|AA11173395	All processed foods are bad for the environment to some degree.  They are also terrible for your health, and should never be a mainstay of your diet.    If you want soy, find organic edamame.    Of course you can be a vegan without soy products.  Just buy whole foods and learn to cook.|`|AA11927261	I know of no way you can be vegan and not use soy.  We use soy in almost everything now, even the ink on your newspaper and most packaging.  I know of no other protein replacement that is half as good as soy.|`|DFXS4SB4aa	Um...pretty much all factories are bad for the environment. They pollute like crazy. Soy is healthy for you, but you can certainly be vegan without it.|`|VtqdeSQ8aa	idk about the factories. As far as farms, buy orgainc soy so that it isn't covered in pesticides.    You can be vegan w/o the soy, by getting your protein from whole grains nut & seeds, lentils & beans. If you like protein shakes there are some made with rice protein. Brown rice is a good source of protein but if you're not buying fair trade, know that rice that is imported usually expolits their workers badly. (Check out the latest VegNews for more info on rice, bananas, coffee and chocolate trade)    If you're really concerned, research each company that you are interested in purchasing from. I would consider packaging that is made from post-consumer materials and printed in soy ink and recyclable again to be a good sign. I tend to think less of companies that package health foods in packaging that is not easily recycleable (like  6 &  7 plastics)|`|VH29BFuGaa	Any factory is bad for the enviroment. Soy ones can't be as  bad as say a place raising cows for beef or what ever.    You could be vegan without soy. You'd have to eat more nuts  and other sources of protien but yeah, you can do it.    Soy is in like everything these days anyway.
95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	You're not becoming an alcoholic, no matter what anyone says based on what their gym teacher told them in health class. Alcoholism is a physical dependence on alcohol.     Doctors even RECOMMEND that you drink red wine, even as much as 2-3 glasses a night, as part of a heart-healthy program. So long as you aren't drinking to get or be drunk, you don't have a drinking problem.     Enjoy your wine; the French drink more than that and it's attributed to them being so healthy. Like anything, always in moderation. And for you, this is moderation.     Obviously, the "boundary" is different for every individual.     So don't worry. As long as you don't start drinking right out of the bottle and passing out instead of falling asleep, you're fine.|`|AA11168533	dont worry caz your hardly hardcore enjoy your few glasses after a hard days work im sure u deserve it!!|`|zOtiAN3xaa	if you go buy the number of units it ain't good!! you should only have so many per week!! but fek it!! i have a couple beers every night since i stopped drinking jack.. some im turning and looking the other way!!    remember its far better to drink small amounts everyday than binging at the weekend!!|`|yzduoBWKaa	If you can go without it, then your not an alcholic, but if can't then I would suggest getting help.|`|RW9TMBykaa	your fine, like one of the answerers said, a dependence on alchohol and drinking to get drunk would be worrying factors, my mum could down a bottle of wine with no effects whatsoever, when the next person would be k.o'd after a couple of glasses, if the alcohol factor bugs you a bit, why not go to a specialist shop and look for the taste you like but with out the alchohol content or a lower content if it helps you wind down.|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	You sort of answered your own question, you said "I dont know where the boundary is", this is something you need to figure out.  Do you feel guilty for having more then 1 glass of wine?  Are you unable to function that evening on things that need to be done?Or the next day because of your drinking?  Do you drink because you are self medicating from the day?  WHy do you drink?  Are you dependant on that couple glasses of wine?     Try not to have a glass of wine for the next couple days and see how you feel. If you can create some clear realistic boundaries around drinking, then you should be fine, sometimes its easy to get carried away, but thats why its important to have control over your indulgances, if you find that you do not have control, you may have a problem  Alcoholism is defined by everyone different, it sounds to me like you are giving in to temptation and your worrying that this may become a problem, and your right, it could become a problem, but you are aware which is important, as I said try to think about what that "clear" boundary means to you, does that mean purchasing one regular size bottle a week? And if you over indulge one night, you will only have enough wine for a glass or two for the remainder of the week, or does this mean you decide not to drink during week days because it interupts with your daily life?|`|LgsbdYCPaa	i think if you are enjoying wine of the fact that it tastes nice and helps you sleep your not a alcoholic but.. maybe one night dont have a glass and see how you feel..if you miss it and really want a glass then u may have a small slight problem...    but most people have a drink every evening!    to me a alcoholic is someone who needs a drink first thing or has to get drunk every night..    good luck xx|`|dpKqgfduaa	You're like me!!!

As it is, you're probably exceeding your recommended maximum weekly units, so be careful.|`|AA11394457	Try switching to red grape juice(or any non-alcoholic drink), or just sticking to 2 glasses maximum, anything else is way too much alcohol daily.    The fact that you acknowledge you could be an alcoholic makes me think that you're definitely not one YET. Just remember that alcohol can destroy lives.|`|5zNwBQZHaa	Try going without it for a week.  If you are craving it - then you have problem.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	I would say you are fine, if you were doing it to get drunk and you would resort to any type of liquor to do so, then it might be a concern. However I think that there are a lot of people who go home and enjoy a few glasses of wine most nights!|`|Idv1MZIlaa	I would say that you have to think about what makes you like (and drink) the wine. Is it the feeling of the alcohol? If so, then there could be a problem. 1-2 glasses of red wine per day is actually very healthy for your heart. If it is for any "buzz" you get then there could be a problem. Otherwise I think you are fine, and should enjoy an innocent indulgence.|`|lq8YBCwzaa	No, and alcoholic needs to drink as soon as they wake up. They also want to drink at work. They 'have' to have it.|`|VNmx7ADYaa	i'm not too sure but i would be careful because this sort of thing can get out of control. why don't you keep it to about three nights a week so it's more of a treat so you can enjoy it more.

Great Pancakes Recipe  189648     This recipe is from Bisquick, but I get the clone product from Save-A-Lot (I'm sure that there are others too) which is much cheaper and works just as well. I love pancakes for brunch, sometimes with a little scrambled eggs, or even for supper. These ones are quick and easy and they haven't failed me yet. The key seems to be having your griddle or skillet nice and hot and using just the slightest bit of cooking oil to keep the pancakes from sticking. I also use a non-stick skillet. Sometimes, I top my pancakes with good, locally-produced sorghum molasses (never that nasty dark stuff!) instead of pancake syrup. It makes for a nice change from the routine. Butter too!!!   by Bone Man     15 min | 5 min prep     SERVES 4     2 cups Bisquick baking mix (or other)   1 cup whole milk   1 tablespoon sugar (or less)   2 tablespoons lemon juice   2 teaspoons baking powder   2 large eggs, beaten   1 teaspoon canola oil     In a large mixing bowl, blend all ingredients except for the canola oil.   Heat your skillet or griddle and when it gets hot, add the canola oil and spread it on the surface with a spatula until the entire pan surface has been "lubricated".   Pour on the pancake mix, the size that you wish. When one side gets golden brown, give them a flip until the second side is the same.   Serve with butter and syrup.   NOTE: You can add a cup thawed frozen blueberries to the mix for a special treat!|`|W2XyyqSAaa	I'm reading the box of Bisquick...  2 cups original bisquick  1 cup of milk  2 eggs  stir in 1 Tbsp sugar  2 tsp baking powder  and 2 Tbsp lemon juice|`|PenbhD1uaa	Add 3 tbsp. sugar, add 1 tsp. baking powder and 3 tsp. lemon juice to one recipe Bisquick pancakes.

hNZDrj5gaa	Geri Vit Bs are great supplements to take B12 great source of energy because it helps metabolize Proteins, remember our bodies are about 89% water and most of the rest is protein, a little calcium in the bones and some minerals. B6 is a great antioxidant helps remove the toxins the make us sluggish.   They will not keep you up at night, in fact you can take them just before bed and have more energy in the morning. But they are not caffeine Or anything like it.   The best source is of course injection straight into the blood because it bypasses the liver, as often the liver does not recognize useful supplements(especially th beginning and therefore flushes them out.   Thus the bright yellow urine (which is a good thing by the way) if it means that you are getting more than the body can use.    The second best source is Sub-lingual that you melt under your tongue  preference Also straight to the blood stream but a little more expensive so B it up Dear and remember that a Diet is a life style not just your cal intake. It is what you eat, when you eat, how much you eat, and what are your activities before and after you eat.   If you want a permanent change then you have to make a permanent change. Fads will get you into that smaller dress size for a wedding but as soon as you go back to the old diet well you know the rest.     Hope this helps|`|FnkioOguaa	B12 & B6 are great supplements.  They help your body utilize the nutrition found in foodstuffs more effeciently.  I usually take 1000 mgs of B-12 daily and 500 mgs of B6 three times a week.  In your case however, neither injection nor oral infusion of these nutrients is the best alternative.  Based on your question, I think a bottle of each taken rectally would give your immune system the boost it so desperately cries out for.  I'd suggest removing the child guard caps first.  But be warned, it turns your urine bright (as in glow in the dark) yellow.|`|960pO2oHaa	I take Vits B12 and B6 orally (just like you take multi-vits), anytime I diet. I take one of each every day. They increase metabolism, and control your hunger. You could just do that to save money. They've always worked well for me.     *Take them only in the morning as they rev up ur metabolism and make you feel wide awake (think: energy drinks are FULL of B vits and caffeine). If you take them too late in the day, you'll be up all night.     ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT, TAKE THEM ONLY WITH A MEAL. IF YOU TAKE THEM ON AN EMPTY STOMACH, THEY'LL MAKE YOU NAUSEOUS AS HELL!!!

hstwNjNaaa	I assume you like in the UK? If so, have a great day, turning 18 is such a fun time when you can go out clubbing!    Never Have I Ever  Each person says "Never have I ever..." and then something they haven't ever done (eg - never have I ever...kissed more than one person in one night). If you HAVE done they thing they say, then you take a shot/drink.    The Card Game (I have no idea what it's actually called, but we call it that!)  Get a pack of cards and spread them all face down on the floor/table. Each person takes one card when it's their go. If it's a red, then you have the same number of drinks/shots on the card. If it's black you give away that number of drinks to other players. Pick a Queen and everyone has a drink, a King and you have to chug your drink, Ace and you pick someone else to chug. This game gets you drunk so quickly because you also have to drink if you point at someone/something, say somebodies name or swear.    Can't Dance Like Me  Each played says a celebrity/person you all knows name, and then can't dance like me (eg - Tony Blair, can't dance like me) to a little tune so it has a rhythm (make up your own!) and then the next person says a person who relates to that person (so after Tony Blair you could say Gordon Brown, Cherie Blair, George Bush etc...) If a player can't think of a person, repeats a name or goes out of rhythm then they drink!    Have a great 18th!!|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Ummm were are you getting the alcohol?

The two simple answers I can give you are: Use less heat or oil the pan so the chicken doesn't stick.|`|P0EAzyw8aa	Heat is up to high, chicken should be cooked with a slower heat.|`|AA11065140	Well, I'd start by cooking it at a lower temperature.  Burning is an indication that it's too hot.    A fairly easy trick to cleaning it is to use powdered meat tenderizer.  Moisten the pan by running it under water, and sprinkle on the powder.  Let it sit for half an hour, and then give it a scrub.  The meat tenderizer should break down the proteins in the burned on meat, which makes it easier to remove.|`|sOoz0Fduaa	Canola oil prevents sticking and is much healthier than butter.

3WItFAwlaa	I grew up on the Gulf Coast.  Crawfish is one of my favorite foods.  Sorry, but they are very high in sodium and fat especially if you eat them the right way.  You know, sucking the head which is nothing but fat.  Personally, I think eating crawfish would be worth blowing any diet.   If you do, leave the heads alone and it won't be as bad.

They are low in fat, high in protein.  And crawfish boil is not cooked in oil, so I would say it's very diet friendly!  Don't worry about the cholesterol, btw.  Studies have shown that cholesterol in your blood comes from high consumption of saturated fats, not of dietary cholesterol.

VdbhuUYBaa	Nope.|`|YYAu9lFDaa	is this a serious question?<br>  CHICKEN broth?<br>  <br>  to answer you... no|`|Jm6Vtptuaa	vegetarians and vegans don't eat meat.|`|YvNCOYZZaa	I'm a grownup, so I'm allowed to eat whatever I want.  And there are no veggie police that will come and arrest me or 'ban' me from the vegetarian club should I eat meat. <br>  <br>  But, Chicken Broth is from CHICKEN, which is meat.  Therefore, anyone who chooses to eat it is not a vegetarian nor vegan.|`|5zNwBQZHaa	No to both vegan and vegetarian.|`|AA12031316	Allowed?  The veggie police won't come after you, but a true veg would not eat chicken broth-its made from dead chickens!|`|1zNfZEDdaa	technically nothing that would kill the animals in the making. They cook the meat and dump the broth... for our use. So no we're not really supposed to =/ <br>  You can find vegetable soups without it though! Like the thick and chunky vegetable soup!|`|MDnqaQ9yaa	No. Vegans and Vegetarians do not eat meat and chicken is meat. Since the broth is coming from the chicken, it's a no no to eat it. If you do eat it, then whats the point of calling yourself a vegetarian?|`|JGRMA4KPaa	anyone can eat whatever they want. its up to the individual how strict of a vegetarian they are. but a strict vegetarian would not eat chicken broth!|`|07h7QByDaa	No, it's not vegetarian. Although, when I was younger, I thought I could still eat chicken noodle soup and just not eat the chicken chunks... yeah, as I later found out, not so much. :/|`|OMEDzf3maa	NO.

8lYZROjuaa	I make mine in a cast iron skillet and it turns out fantastic every time.  Hope it works for you.|`|AA11146432	any good quality, heavy bottomed skillet - cast iron is great - will do.<br>  <br>  Cheers|`|bSVlTvlcaa	I also use a cast iron.  You can use a stainless steel skillet as long as the handle is oven safe.|`|R8Hm0dFAaa	You can make a frittata in your largest frying pan. A heavy pan is best, like cast iron or calphalon, or any good professional cookware, because it will heat more evenly. We've made frittatas several times and we don't own a frittata pan.<br>  <br>  Maybe if you were going to make frittatas all the time, it'd be worth getting one, but it'll come out just fine in a regular pan.<br>  <br>  Most important thing is to let the refrigerated ingredients come up to room temp before cooking. Otherwise the outside will burn before the inside is fully cooked.|`|AA10636233	I use my #8 cast iron skillet! It works great, and I didn't have to go to a specialty shop to get one lol!

nfab8459aa	You are missing out on the good stuff!! if you are afraid of spicy  try them with lemon .... i mean really squeeze a lemon on top ... because lemon cuts the spicy flavor ... if still too hot try them with no lemon ... but cream cheese  :) or nacho cheese :) <br>  I love them im going to go buy a bag right now ................|`|0jUGSaZPaa	I know when I tried one, it wasn't until 20 seconds later did the spices kick up.<br>  <br>  But, I'm very sensitive to spicy foods...  <br>  <br>  Give it a whirl.. :)|`|YYAu9lFDaa	try one|`|ntoqplOqaa	I usually am very tolerant to spicy things but those cheetos are HOT I had to buy a drink too... I would not try them they were very spicy and not terribly tasty either :)|`|I98iE7ybaa	Flamin' hot cheetos are extremely spicy. I wouldn't consider buying them unless you're into very hot foods. i do enjoy them myself, though.

Wednesday: Hearty chicken and lots of vegetable soup, with chopped up swiss chard soup.   Thursday: Beef stew  Friday: good old fashioned fish and chips with a salad or coleslaw on the side.|`|e87cd8e8c653d0f68402573b2d9f3ef1aa	Meatloaf is low budget.. you can even drop globs of it into muffin tins for fair sizes [though the recipe is universal.. I throw in a sauce of... 1/2 cup brown sugar [for every 2-4 lbs of meat], 1/4 cup ketchup, 1/4 cup of yellow mustard, as much Worchester sauce as you prefer.. dash of pepper and salt.. maybe some rosemary or thyme..]  You can always mix up the meat too.. maybe a half pound of ground pork.. ground beef... ground turkey and mix it up..  Again I see meatloaf as very simple.. you eyeball all your ingredients.. you can't mess up... You could use breadcrumbs and eggs to hold it together or not.. Throw in some chopped onions or some veggies [to be sneaky]    ----    Maybe stuffed peppers?  Seriously.. walk around your local grocery store or browse the flyers to see what's on sale.. Some weeks veggies are expensive other times they're cheap.    My dad brings home random things and I'll stand in the kitchen thinking of what to do.. or I'll just throw this and that together and come up with a good meal..    Do you have a crockpot?[slowcooker] make a stew and homemade dinner rolls [i've recently made my first bread recipe and everyone loved it]    My mum on the fly pulled together the poor man's pizza last ngiht and it was sooo good.  You buy flat bread [pita bread], pizza sauce, you're cooked meats[pepperoni, etc etc], hard cheese... cut and slice everything to your liking... Place bread on cookie sheet.. pre-heat oven to 375.. [cooking varies but 10-16 minutes worked for us]... make the pizza's you're way and pop it into the oven.      If you're daring you could try making a bread with meat and herbs and cheese in it.|`|0Elxt7Yxaa	Toad In The Hole:    http://hubpages.com/hub/Easy-Toad-In-The...|`|38jn3zN6aa	Shepards pie!

BhEVhdvDaa	Red Delicious are not as firm, higher water content, mushier when cooked so unless you want a mushy apple crisp then you should use a different kind (Granny Smith is pretty common). The texture will be better. If you don't mind the texture then go ahead and use any apple, it'll taste fine, probably will be sweeter, and squishier.|`|AA11367986	Too soft.  Better to use Granny Smith, McIntosh, or Golden Delicious for baking.|`|HkMhWvtgaa	As others have pointed out, they do not stay firm when cooked.  They also tend to lose their color quickly and become brown.  In addition, they have been bred to have a very high sugar content, so if a recipe is supposed to be a little tart in flavor, they would not be the best choice.    I probably wouldn't use them for apple pie.  However, for some recipes, they are excellent!  For example:    CHARCOAL GRILL APPLE SUNDAES  2 red delicious apples, washed, cored, and chopped  (peeling is optional)    1 tablespoon brown sugar (white granulated sugar can be substituted)    1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract    1 teaspoon ground cinnamon    1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg    1/4 teaspoon ground ginger    1/4 teaspoon ground clove    1 tablespoon butter    Spray nonstick cooking spray on one side of a sheet of aluminum foil about 12 inches long.    Loosely combine all ingredients and put them in the middle of the oiled side of the foil.    Draw together the corners of the foil and twist them closed so that the foil packet resembles a giant Hershey's Kiss.  Wrap a second layer of foil over it in the same way.    Put the foil packet on the grill while you cook and eat your hamburgers or steaks.  Every few minutes, shake and rotate the packet.    For dessert, serve contents of packet over vanilla ice cream.  The apple chunks will have softened into a sweet, spicy sauce.|`|MBPR4PX5aa	they get soggy|`|fc5c0507db7f5b77389a61a92ae3cf1faa	they get all soggy and don't taste good anymore|`|CA06qy8Laa	They do not bake well, they get mushy.|`|9afcc4dd55438d0d72ec5c22e28c3f8daa	They get soggy and mushy with very little cooking, so don't bake well.|`|nOVSf06Raa	you can use them if you want but don't expect to find chunks of apples in your baking these are apples that will melt down leaving a moist spot where they were and your baking will have moist spots those apples are best used in salads,  I have included a list of apples and their use I usually use the Jona Gold they retain their shape and are very tasty    http://www.paulnoll.com/Oregon/Canning/a... .|`|hT7BhNamaa	Anne, red delicious as long as they are nice and crisp are my favorite eating, but not cooking. For cooking like for apple pies, I make sure I buy Granny Smith, the greener looking the skin the better. I also cut down on the added sugar and Cinnamon, you want to taste apple not sugar. I also make sure that the apple is still firm before I add to the pie. That will enure that when I serve the pie, there is still some bite or crunch to the apple, not goo.|`|LdzTP5VXaa	it doesn't hold up it's only good uncooked but when it is it turns into mush.
hHCdXq0Naa	Fresh raw veggies and Ranch dressing to dip them in ... hard-boiled eggs ... quesadillas (flour tortillas & cheese in the microwave)|`|fZnuyKSZaa	Go to the fridge and make the wildest sandwich you can imagine|`|Su0LaNhoaa	peanutbuter toast, cheese quesadilla, grilled cheese, apple with honey or peanutbutter|`|45I3X5U5aa	Rice krispie treats!

aDOe1RyOaa	Make sure you have lots of balloons, contrast with light pink, dark pink and some whites.  Custom made invitations are also unique.  Good place to start with your shopping might be eBay store.    http://stores.ebay.com/Party-Supplies-R-...    They have just opened selling at wholesale prices good quality items.

I ordered cute invitations to go with my theme and a birthday cake to match.  I invited everyone in my class and old school (about 40 people).  My mom rented the upstairs of the community centre (Lions club or similar place will do).  Hired a D.J. (or have a friend who is a budding D.J.).  I also had about 3 door prizes.  The room was decorated with streamers and balloons.  Food was pizza, finger foods, chips, fruit punch and LOTS of water.  The party ran from 6:30 to 10:30.  We had to have chaperones, but they were outside watching the entrances.  Most guests gave money, which was great for new clothes!  The cost of the party was less than $600.00.  But having all your friends in one place was really cool and you leave the mess there!  I've also had smaller, intimate parties with really close friends.  Some ideas are:  Small party ideas (close friends)  - i'm guessing your birthday is in the winter?   if so, book a hotel room close to some ski/snowboarding/tubing hills, and take some close friends for a wild ride tubing! Then, head back to the hotel for some swimming, and a sleepover.  - Go for some manicures/pedicures! These parties are always my favourites. Your friends would probably enjoy this, especially if you get those crazy designs on your nails.    It all depends on what you are into, and what kind of party you and your parents are willing to have.  best of luck and happy birthday! (:|`|noeuzSU7aa	Rent a local place and Decorate it with pink crazy designs. You can also have your name sculped up with ice. Invite all your closest and family friends and party till night. Everyone will remember.  Take lots of pics?  Hope this helps, good luck ;]|`|G4qY6roFaa	How about a home Day Spa birthday party? You can do make-up, hair, nails, relaxing massages then layout warm towels for the girls to lay around and gossip, play soothing music, candles. I wouldn't really decorate with streamers or banners - but with spa like items - such as the white fluffy towels, flowers... maybe flower petals leading to the spa room! For party gifts, you can put together a spa bag with items that you use to do the make-up, hair, nails, etc. Another great party gift idea is Spa Birthday T-shirts from imaginTEE.com - bonus - they glow in the dark - so then you can have a  sleepover and you will all glow (literally)!|`|2UWub7fqaa	go to hotel and invite people and have a cake and bring movies be Beautiful and have earnings on and have purple and pink on and be nice and have cupcakes and have a dress on thats purple and make the party so nice thats all oh yeah have some red shoes on
53giV6PFaa	If they are non-stick coated and they are scraping and flaking then get rid of them.  If they aren't flaking and just metal - then it probably iron or steel.  I wouldn't use them though if they are rusty.|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	Being rusty, they are probably cast-iron (are they very heavy - or lightweight?)  Cast iron pots are heavy.    They can be the best pots (incidentally the rust won`t hurt you, tho of course you need to clean them).   If they are very light-weight pots, they are probably cheapies  - tho I have never know any pots rust apart from castiron ones.    Most pots are made either of stainless steel, steel, or aluminium...all easily recognisable.|`|yla1B4ssaa	It sounds like cast iron....and if thats the case if they look like that they are even better to cook with and you shouldn't use hard detergents on them|`|490e4f226b74a4050a4f5768c24d97e9aa	This will help you http://housewares.about.com/od/cookware/...

CupCake ?|`|AnhoHRFTaa	When it comes to making sauces at home being cheaper then bought sauces, don't assume that's true. The sauce should be a whole lot more delicious but not cheaper. I pickle my own chutneys etc. Ingredients are money, time is money, gas/electricity is money etc etc. If you want to make your own, if you know the name of sauce from the container, then do a search on that name. You will be amazed at how many recipes will show in the search results. Video Jug is great because it also shows how to make it in video.    As for the recipe above, I never knew that olive oil was used in Chinese cooking, live and learn. I would have thought that Ground nut/Peanut oil and a dash of sesame oil would be more appropriate. But what do I know?
hHCdXq0Naa	Coffeecakes aren't usually layer cakes.  They aren't quite as sweet as a regular cake; and have a larger texture to the batter (more like sweet breads) - that's why they're appropriate for breakfast with coffee:) ...  You could do a spice cake though, in layers with buttercream filling and icing (although I think cream cheese frosting is better)
3xksQz9haa	www.allrecipes.com|`|eZDoQPg8aa	One of the easiest cake recipes ever and no one will know (unless you tell) that these cakes started with a mix!    1 Duncan Hines cake mix, any flavor  1 4 serving size Jello instant pudding, same flavor as cake mix  4 eggs  1/2 cup vegetable oil  1 cup water    Put all of the above together in a mixing bowl and mix for 2 minutes.  Place in a greased cake pan or pans.  This makes 1 13" x 9" or 2 9" layers or 1 bundt cake pan.  Bake at 350F until cake tests done by inserting a toothpick near the center.  If the toothpick comes out clean, it's done.    Remove pans to cooling rack, let cool 10 minutes and remove from pans.    Frost as desired or you can make a glaze and put that on.  Favorite combos in this house are:    Lemon cake, lemon pudding mix, cream cheese frosting and using lemon pie filling between layers.    Devils Food cake mix, chocolate pudding, chocolate and vanilla glaze with dark sweet cherries between the layers.  A Black Forest take off.    Yellow cake with vanilla pudding, chocolate frosting with a layer of peanut butter under the icing.

4dntstR9aa	If you enjoy your cup of coffee but are unsure of what youve read about coffee and high blood pressure, you may be ready to give up the luxury. Dont fret! I have some info here to cheer you up big time.    We may have heard that coffee has a down side as well as a plus which can affect blood pressure, so what are they and can the negative effects be explained away?    Effects connected with Coffee and High Blood Pressure    Negative  - anxiety  - loosing sleep  - elevated blood pressure  - coronary artery disease    Positive  - natural diuretic/laxative  - antioxidant  - cardio protective    Coronary Artery Disease and Elevated Blood Pressure.    Is there a connection between coffee and high blood pressure being elevated, and/or causing coronary artery disease? Many researchers say that they have found little evidence implicating caffeine to cardiovascular disease. (This will cover coffee and high blood pressure). Heart disturbances only occurred with high doses, or in sensitive individuals. They report that when administered acutely, moderate doses of caffeine can increase blood pressure and decrease heart rate. For most people, tolerance develops to these effects within a few days and there is no alteration in cardiovascular effects for habitual caffeine users.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	The caffeine can raise some people's blood pressure.

Unfortunately, companies like to market the buzzwords, without worrying about what it really means.  Many things are labeled "natural" flavors or colors on many foods.  One of those "natural" colors comes from crushed insects (google carmine, which is red food color)  Yes, those crushed insects are all natural, all right-just a little TOO natural for my taste!  Something can be labeled as natural and still come from genetically modified or pesticide laden foods.  Its still considered natural despite the fact that its covered with toxic stuff.  Keep in mind that the FDA considers tobacco to be an all natural products too, and approve cigarettes for consumption.|`|cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	The organic refers to the soya beans being grown with out pesticides,and Natural Cane Extract is a sugar made with sugar cane juice, but it is not processed and filtered, so it is not bleached or refined, so no animal product these yo-yo's who say it is filtered through, they use cloth filters, but it is an all natural sweetener, I buy it here in Canada, I get it at a bulk store and use it in cooking and baking, it is also labelled Kosher.    Most often I buy the grocery type, but when I go to the Chinese store get the unprocessed and more natural unsweetened type, it is stronger and heavier in flavour, but bake and cook with the refined ones, both plain and vanilla for cereals and things like rice puddings and desserts.    No switch, it is not the same, but they have the same basic properties. Most other have other sweeteners and thickeners like guar and locust bean gums to keep them from splitting, I also drink the raw milk from the Chinese shops here in canada, it is is not as easy to take.|`|HSOp9J4Iaa	Dont drink it!

Tip:  by it WHOLE bean, and grind yourself.  Tastes a lot better.      Tip 2:  if you can, try buying coffee from a local, non-chain coffee house.  We have one in our town that sells EXCELLENT, locally-roasted coffee for the same price as Starbuck's.    Tip 3:  Also, for general coffee goodness... use good filtered water if you can, and be sure your coffee maker is a good brand (clean it occasionally with a white vinegar/water mixture).  It makes a difference!
fBxUaHn1aa	The one on the Bisquick box is always good. Or Hungry Jack are also good. I like to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Easier than making from scratch, and they always come out perfect. Some waffle makers can over cook the waffles so watch for the steam coming out of the sides, after it stops steaming it's done. Make sure to use some non stick cooking spray each time you fill with batter. Don't overfill the griddles, just a large spoon full in the middle and when you close it, the batter will spread out.|`|4de3da5babb437b65a9e55c075cdbbdeaa	You might think this is silly, but the best 'recipe' I've ever used was on the back of a box of Jiffy cornbread mix.  Yes, cornbread waffles.  They are the best waffles I've ever had in my life, I'll never use another way.|`|XcNoptFbaa	INGREDIENTS  Waffles  2 cups all-purpose flour   1 teaspoon salt   4 teaspoons baking powder   2 tablespoons white sugar   2 eggs   1 1/2 cups warm milk   1/3 cup butter, melted   1 teaspoon vanilla extract   My folders:         DIRECTIONS  In a large bowl, mix together flour, salt, baking powder and sugar; set aside. Preheat waffle iron to desired temperature.   In a separate bowl, beat the eggs. Stir in the milk, butter and vanilla. Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture; beat until blended.   Ladle the batter into a preheated waffle iron. Cook the waffles until golden and crisp. Serve immediately.|`|PenbhD1uaa	Here's four that I love and have made myself.  They always turn out perfect which i why I use them a lot.  Sunday is waffle day in our house.    Pumpkin Applesauce Waffles  Serves Two (I usually triple this)    1/2 Cup Complete Pancake Mix  1/2 Cup Water  1/2 Cup Pumpkin Puree  1/4 Cup Applesauce  1 tsp Cinnamon    Mix all ingredients, adding more water or mix if necessary. Pour 1/2 Cup of batter on the waffle iron and bake until golden brown. Serve with butter and maple syrup.  **************  Spiced Apple Waffles  3 large eggs  ? cup buttermilk, warmed  ? cup milk, warmed  ? cup unsalted butter, melted  1 medium Granny Smith apple, peeled, cored and grated  1? cups whole wheat pastry flour (or all-purpose flour is fine too)  1? tsp Pumpkin pie spice  ? tsp baking soda  ? tsp salt  ? cup granulated sugar  1 cup toasted pecans (completely optional)  powdered sugar to sift on top    Preheat waffle iron. In large bowl, whisk together eggs, buttermilk, milk and butter. Stir in apple. In another bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, spice, baking soda and salt. Add flour mixture to egg mixture; whisk until smooth (some small lumps are ok).    Sprinkle 2 T. pecans (if using) onto waffle iron. Pour about 2/3 cup batter onto surface. Cook waffles until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Keep warm in 200F. oven while cooking the remaining waffles.  ********  Lemon-Poppy Seed Waffles  Ingredients: Makes 10 Waffles    1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour  1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder  1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon sugar  1/2 teaspoon salt  2 tablespoons wheat germ  2 large eggs  1 1/4 cups whole or 2% milk  6 tablespoons melted butter (reserve 1 tbs to brush on waffle iron)  Zest of 1 lemon  2 tablespoons poppy seeds    Note: If making the maple whipped cream put a medium metal or glass bowl in the freezer along with the attachments for a hand-held mixer.    Preheat the waffle iron (check the manufacturers setting and adjust according to how well done you like your waffles). Using a fork, cut the dry ingredients together thoroughly in a large bowl. Beat the eggs, milk and lemon zest together with a fork or whisk and pour into the dry ingredients. Mix together with the fork until there are no large clumps, but as with pancakes, dont over mix! Cut in the 5 tablespoons of butter last.    When the iron is ready, brush some butter on the top and bottom of the iron. Ladle on just enough batter so that it wont squirt over the edges when you close the iron. Sprinkle a dusting of poppy seeds over the surface of the batter and close the iron. When the waffle irons beeps or blinks (or when the waffles have been cooked to your liking), take your waffle out. Serve with maple syrup or maple-whipped cream, see below.    Maple Whipped Cream  Ingredients:  3/4 cup heavy cream  1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract  1 tablespoon pure maple syrup    Put a medium metal or glass bowl in the freezer along with the attachments for a hand-held mixer. Allow to cool for a least 15 minutes.    Put the heavy cream, vanilla and maple syrup into a your dry, cold bowl and whip with a hand-held mixer until the cream holds a soft peak. That's it.    *******     French Toast Waffles  Serves two    3 large eggs  1/4 cup heavy cream  pinch of salt  1 tablespoon sugar  1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract  1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon  2 teaspoons orange zest, finely grated  4 slices brioche or challah pullman*    1. Lightly beat the eggs, then add all other ingredients, except the bread, and beat until well combined.    2. Soak two slices of bread in the egg mixture for about 1 minute, then turn over and soak the other side of each slice for another minute. Move the slices of bread to the waffle iron, and arrange them to fit.    3. Press down the waffle iron to make those waffle-grids on the french toast. As the waffles cook, theyll rise and get all puffy, then start to deflate again. Take the waffles out just after theyve started on their deflating stage. This ensures that you get a little of the crispy, and a little of the eggy insides.    4. Repeat with the other two slices. Serve with confectioners sugar and/or maple syrup.    *This just means brioche or challah bread in the usual white bread loaf shape :) Not the large mushroom-shaped brioches or the braided challah. Square slices basically fit better into a waffle iron.
XcNoptFbaa	Ingredients: Bacon Bites  ? 12 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature   ? 1/3 cup parmesan cheese, grated   ? 1/2 cup roasted red pepper, diced   ? 3/4 cup scallion, sliced, white and green   ? 20 slices white bread, soft   ? 1 lb lean bacon   Directions  1.   Mix together the cheeses until smooth. Stir in the peppers and scallions until evenly distributed; set aside.   2.   Trim the crusts from the slices of bread.   3.   Once the bread is trimmed, spread the slices with the filling, covering it completely.   4.   Roll the bread up from the short side, pressing down just enough to make it stick to itself.   5.   Wrap a slice of bacon and wrap it around the roll, overlapping the bacon to cover the bread completely. If you need more than one bacon slice, tuck the end of the second bacon slice under the end of the first. Trim the bacon when you get to the top of the roll.   6.   Freeze the wrapped rolls for 30 minutes to firm them up.   7.   To bake, preheat the oven to 350F Lightly grease a baking sheet, or line it with parchment paper.   8.   Slice the rolls in thirds and place on the baking sheet, cut side down. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes (5 minutes longer if baking from frozen), until the bacon is crisp and the tops are golden brown.   9.   Remove from the oven and place on a serving platter; let cool for 5 minutes before serving.|`|SehQJ3Kjaa	A big round whole rye bread ( hard crust) with a lot but not all of the center scooped out filled with chill and cheese on top|`|PenbhD1uaa	I love this but i i usually add more jalapeno's.  Also, you could make this and then serve in wonton cups.  Top with a little shredded cheese or serve as is.  WONTON CUPS:  Cooking spray  18 wonton wrappers, thawed (if frozen)  2 teaspoons canola oil  1/4 teaspoon salt   Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Spray 2 mini-muffin tins with cooking spray.    Brush the wonton wrappers with oil, and place each wrapper into a section of a mini-muffin tin. Gently press each wrapper into the tin and arrange so that it forms a cup shape. The wrapper will overlap itself and stick up out of the cup. Sprinkle with salt and bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until browned and crisp. Remove from the tin and allow wrappers to cool.     *****    FOR THE DIP    Jalape?o Popper Dip  2- 8 ounce packages cream cheese, room temp  1 cup mayonnaise  1 cup shredded Mexican blend cheese  1/2 cup Parmesan cheese  1- 4 ounce can chopped green chilies  1- 4 ounce can sliced jalape?os- double if you like heat    1 cup panko bread crumbs  1/2 cup Parmesan cheese  1/2 stick butter, melted    In a food processor add the first 6 ingredients and process until smooth. You do not need to drain either can of peppers. Spread the dip into a greased 2 quart casserole. In a bowl mix bread crumbs and the other 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese. Pour melted butter over top crumb mixture and mix well. Sprinkle crumb mixture evenly over the dip and bake in a 375 oven for about 20 minutes. You want the top to get browned and the dip to be heated through and bubble gently on the edges. Do not over heat this dish or the mayonnaise with separate and you will have a grease puddle in your dip. Serve with Buttery crackers or a sliced French baguette.

AA12065568	I'm not sure if places where you live have dress codes, but around here most clubs don't let you in if you are wearing: sneakers, baseball hats, warm-up pants or workout gear. Some even have stricter dress codes and don't allow jeans or jerseys either.  Be sure to have fun and keep an eye out for each other. Don't accept any drinks form random guys unless you watch the bartender make it and hand it right to you. Also, take however much money you want to spend for the nigt and leave the credit cards at home.

2pRjNRa0aa	I doubt he had poisoning. The symptoms would have been worse. Something like him not waking up at all, would be something to be concerned about.    Hopefully, he's learned a lesson from this. Drinking in moderation is fine, but to be falling down drunk is stupid. He has to learn his limits, and perhaps next time, he'll drink water in between each alcoholic drink. That will help keep him from getting snookered and having a bad hangover the next day.    This is another reason why alcohol needs to be kept out of the hands of minors. They start drinking too fast and end up like your brother did. (You never said if he was a minor or not, but it sounds like he may be.)|`|zjFMdPOiaa	If he feels OK now, there should not be a problem.  HOWEVER, live and learn.  Don't be stupid.  Everything in moderation.|`|rsTB7D1zaa	That was not alcohol poisoning.  Generally with alcohol poisoning you would go into a coma, or atleast be very hard to wake up.  You would definitely black out from alcohol poisoning.    Funny how drinking doesn't significantly alter your speech patterns (sentence structure type of things), it just mucks up the message from your brain to your mouth and it comes out all slurred.    This won't cause any permanent damage, by itself.  Continuing to do this will obviously cause significant problems later in life.    My suggestions for next time would be to measure shots with a standard 1.5fl oz glass.  Don't do more than 2 shots in an hour, or have more than 2 drinks in one hour.  Drink water between drinks.  It takes 1 hour on an empty stomach for you to fully feel the effects of a drink, 2-3 hours if you've eaten.  Don't ever drink more than you already have because the last drinks didn't do anything.  Give it time then decide if you can handle more or not.|`|m1cEbzBcaa	yes he was poisioned    its called being drunk... even getting a buzz is being poisoned  alcohol is poison.    no unless its a common occurance you shouldn't worry about it being a big issue.|`|Idv1MZIlaa	It sounds to me like one or both of you are underage and shouldn't be drinking in the first place. That being said alcohol poisoning is serious and if you suspect someone may have had far too much, then he should recieve professional help. Alcohol poisioning can lead to death. It's not funny. Anyway, to me, it sounds like your brother's fist time was just a case of too much at once. A good brother would have helped him out a little more. Think next time. How would you feel if he had died. I bet the parents wouldn't be too happy with you.|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	That's called being drunk; not alcohol poisoning. He didn't permanently damage himself. He doesn't need to go to the hospital. The fact that he threw up is encouraging news.     He's going to have a wicked hangover, but by the day after, he'll be fine.|`|tWD175Pjaa	alcohol is something to be taken in small amounts if your brother drank so much he threw up he had alcohol poisoning. tell him to take it easy and take lots of vitamins and drink plenty of water.It happens to about %50 of people and if it is repetitive it can cause long term health issues.|`|FJpshSA4aa	He'll be fine as long as he doesn't do it all the time. Your body can re-coup from one small episode like that more or less fine. But don't make a regular habit of it, anyone who does has a death wish. It's fine to drink in moderation, even daily, but definitely not if you're drinking to that point. Then it isn't even fun. I don't know why people choose to do that to themselves. He may go through it a couple more times until he learns his limit, but once you learn your limit... Trust me. Don't push it.|`|Pe6oIEvfaa	He was drunk

Photograph by: Gentl & HyersYield: 2 Servings    3 half-pint containers of fresh raspberries (about 18 ounces), or 1 pound frozen raspberries    4 large egg yolks  1/2 cup granulated sugar  1/2 cup light corn syrup  2 tablespoons kirsch or champagne    3 large egg whites    1 cup heavy cream    1 tablespoon superfine sugar    Bittersweet Chocolate Hearts  Confectioners' sugar, for garnish    Line a 9-by-13-by-2-inch baking pan (1/4 sheet) with parchment paper. Set aside. Place raspberries (if using fresh raspberries, reserve 1/2 cup for garnish) in a medium skillet over medium heat. Simmer until raspberries begin to break down and liquid is released, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer raspberries to a food processor, and puree, about 20 seconds. Pass through a fine sieve. Set aside to cool.    Fill a large bowl with ice and water; set aside. Bring a stockpot a quarter full of water to a boil. Let simmer. In a medium stainless-steel bowl, whisk together egg yolks, 2 tablespoons sugar, corn syrup, and kirsch or champagne; place over simmering water. Whisking constantly, cook until mixture thickens (when whisk is lifted over the mixture, the ribbon-like trail it leaves on the surface should hold its shape for 1 or 2 seconds), about 4 minutes. Transfer bowl to the ice-water bath; whisk mixture while it cools. Add 3/4 cup raspberry pure to mixture; whisk to combine. Set aside.    In an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat egg whites on high speed until frothy, about 30 seconds. While mixer is running, gradually add remaining 6 tablespoons sugar; beat until very stiff, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Transfer mixture to a bowl. Beat cream with whisk attachment until stiff; fold into egg whites.    Fold raspberry mixture into egg whites and cream. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking pan; cover with plastic wrap. Transfer to the freezer; freeze until hardened, at least 4 hours. This can be prepared up to 2 days in advance.    To make the raspberry sauce, stir superfine sugar into the remaining raspberry pure (about 2 tablespoons). Refrigerate until ready to serve.    To serve, use a heart-shaped cookie cutter (2 1/2 inches across at the widest point) to cut out four hearts from the semifreddo. Divide the raspberry sauce between two dessert plates. Place a chocolate heart, off center, on top of the raspberry sauce. Place a semifreddo heart on each chocolate heart, and repeat layering until there are three layers of chocolate and two layers of semifreddo, ending with a chocolate heart. Garnish with reserved fresh raspberries (if using), and sift confectioners sugar over the raspberries, if desired.|`|1XNhAdUSaa	Check out this website which has some great recipes and ideas.

L2jPYlbdaa	Well you certainly won't be making an angel food cake since the main ingredient is egg whites :)    How about making a fruit crisp? You can top it with a mixture of oats, butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and nuts.    Here's a good recipe that I like:  http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Apple-Crisp...    You can substitute any fruit. I've made it with peaches before and it was great. I usually the cut the recipe in half with good results.    If you have a box of cake mix such as white, yellow, cinnamon or butter pecan, you can pour a few cans of peaches or other canned or fresh fruit in a baking dish, top with the dry cake mix, and dot with a stick of butter. Then bake at 350 for about 45 minutes and it makes a good cobbler.

If you make it in a dish slightly larger than 9 x 9, you get more surface area of chocolatey goodness.   You can add a handful of nuts if nobody in your family has a nut allergy.    The cool thing?

In it combine the sugar, cocoa, milk and margarine. Cook and stir the mixture over medium heat until the margarine melts, and the sugar dissolves. Bring the pot to a boil, and boil for exactly 1 minute. Add the salt, peanut butter and vanilla. Stir until the peanut butter is dissolved. Finally stir in the oatmeal. The mixture may seem a little runny, but will thicken up as it cools. Drop the mixture from a tablespoon onto a sheet of waxed paper. It should form medium sized cookies. Depending on the size of the cookie, you may end up with as few as 15 or as many as 24.     This is my favorite recipe in the whole wide world. It got it's name because it could be prepared quickly when a housewife looked out her window and saw the preacher riding up the mountain on his horse. By the time the preacher arrived, the cookies were cooling. I remember family members making them for me as a kid, and I still have people calling me just to request this recipe over the phone.|`|INPrlW6Maa	This should work !      1 cup creamy peanut butter   1 cup confectioners' sugar   1 tablespoon honey   6 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate   1 tablespoon shortening   2 cups chopped walnuts           In medium bowl, mix peanut butter, confectioners' sugar and honey until blended.

Rub the seasoning blend into both sides of the steaks.   Arrange 1/4 of the sliced onions in the bottom of a 9x13 inch pan, lay steaks across the onions, top with more onions and pour 1/4 cup of lime juice and 1/4 of the bottle of beer over the top; repeat these layers until you run out of steaks, pouring all remaining lime juice and beer over the top. Cover and refrigerate for 30 to 40 minutes. Do not marinate the steaks for longer than an hour, because the acid from the lime juice in the marinade will begin to cook the meat.     Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil grate. Place steaks on the grill and discard the marinade.   Grill the steaks to your desired degree of doneness, or about 2 minutes per side for well done.     Remove from the grill and allow to rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving with warm tortillas.

AA10255759	They are edible, but you have to crystallize it. I will try to find the instruction, I am sure I once found it. I was interested in it.  Look at how cute they look in here     http://www.surlatable.com/product/books+...    ======================================...    Crystallized Flowers  How to Crystalize, or Candy, Roses, Violets and Primroses    Crystallized flowers, also known as Candied or Sugared flowers, are a very personal way to Decorate your Cakes and desserts. It is easy to Crystalize Flowers!    Crystallizing flowers takes a little time, perhaps as long as a sunny afternoon in the garden, but it is easy to do and the results are beautiful and spectacular!    Edible flowers that may be crystallized include roses, primroses and violets; primroses look delicate on a light summer cake, and violets set in a pale coloured icing on a dark chocolate gateau look magical.    Be sure to identify the flower as edible before attempting to crystallize it! You may also like to try crystallizing mint leaves to add contrast to the colours and flavour.    To ensure that the flowers have not been treated with chemicals not intended for consumption use either flowers that have been grown organically, or gather them from your own garden. When crystallizing delicate flowers such as primroses or violets, pick only a few at a time to ensure that they are remain in perfect condition. Crystallized flowers will store for up to three months if well dried and kept in an airtight container.    Many flowers may also be used in delicious, fragrant home made flower wines, and edible flower salads are both delicious and beautiful.    How to Crystallize flowers  1 medium-size egg white  2 teaspoons rose water (optional, you can use plain water instead, but the rosewater adds a lovely floral flavour)  Caster sugar in a dish  Edible flowers (rose petals, primroses and violets) in perfect condition  A tray covered in greaseproof paper  A soft paintbrush and tweezers  Lightly beat the egg white with the rose water or water; you are aiming for a mixture suitable for coating the petals rather than stiff peaks!    Pick the flowers up either with tweezers or by the stalk. Paint with an even coat of the egg white mix. It may take a little trial and error to find the right thickness to apply; coat thoroughly, but not more. It is important that all surfaces to be preserved are coated.    Before the flower dries, apply an even coating of caster sugar to all the surfaces. You may do this with a combination of dipping the flower in the dish of sugar and by sprinkling the sugar with your forefinger and thumb (useful for fiddly details).    Place the flower onto greaseproof paper and leave to dry for half an hour or so. It will quickly solidify, so ensure that the flower is laid out in the shape you wish for your decorations. If there is a stalk which you did not coat then you can cut it off, repaint the cut edge and then recoat it with sugar. Check for any uncovered areas, which would not preserve well, you can always repaint them with egg white and sprinkle with sugar. Be very careful handling the flowers once they have solidified as they are very fragile!    Leave the flowers in an airy place for 48 hours to dry thoroughly and then store in airtight jars for up to three months. Separate layers of flowers with, greaseproof paper; they make a lovely gift presented in a simply decorated box or jar.|`|fZnuyKSZaa	Yes they are  Here is a list of edible flowers and petals  http://www.dirtdoctor.com/view_question....    or here and their use:  http://whatscookingamerica.net/EdibleFlo...    you can cristalize them or powder them..both ways ask for egg white and icing sugar.. but one is a heated paste out of then two and the other one is just like "dusting " it|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Yes I believe pansies are. But just make sure you buy food grade one first. I think you brush them with beaten egg white and then dip in super fine sugar.|`|INPrlW6Maa	Yes this is for violets but you can use pansies :)      1 egg white, at room temperature     a few drops of water     extra-fine granulated sugar, either purchased or made in a blender or food processor (just blend regular sugar until extra-fine)       Unless your flowers are dusty, do not wash. If you need to wash them, make sure they are completely dry before crystalizing. Other items you will need include two plates, one which you will use to paint the flowers on and the other for the sugar, a small bowl for the egg white, a small paint brush, a thin skewer, and a cake rack covered with waxed paper.       Beat the egg white in the small bowl until foamy, if necessary add a few drops of water to make the white easy to spread.       Hold the violet by the stem and dip it into the egg white, now lay the flower on your painting plate and carefully spread the white on every surface of the flower using the paint brush. You will have to use the skewer to open up the petals. Next transfer the flower to the sugar plate, again using the skewer to open the petals, carefully sprinkle every surface with the extra-fine sugar. Be sure not to miss any spots. Arrange the flower on the cake rack, using the skewer to place the petals back in the original positions. If you happen to knock some of the sugar off, just sprinkle with a little more sugar. Clip the stem off of the flower using scissors.       After all of your flowers are coated, set your rack in a warm, dry place, such as a gas stove heated by the pilot light. After they are partially dry, transfer the flowers to an uncovered cake rack and continue drying. This could take several days. To test for dryness, check the green base of the bloom and the heart of the flower to make sure they have no moisture. These will keep indefinitely if stored in layers, separated by tissue paper in a cardboard box.|`|UbXp2K26aa	why would you want to put real flowers on a cake? I think that's nasty.

Melt 1/3 cup of butter in a 9   inch square cake pan in the oven and remove from heat. Stir  in the brown sugar. Arrange pineapple slices on top of the  sugar, and put a cherry inside of each pineapple ring. Set  aside. In a small bowl combine flour, baking powder and salt.  Set aside. In a medium bowl cream remaining butter and sugar.  Add eggs one at a time and continue beating until light. Stir  in vanilla. Alternate additions of dry ingredients and milk  to the creamed mixture, beginning and ending with dry  ingredients. Pour over the pineapple in the cake pan. Bake  for 50 to 60 minutes, until toothpick inserted in the centre  comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes, then turn upside down  over a serving plate. Leave the pan on top of the cake for 2  to 3 minutes to let all the syrup and fruit drop out. Serve  warm.    ** you may wanna serve that with whipped cream ;)    ``  CARDAMOM & DARK RUM PINEAPPLE UPSIDE DOWN CAKE :    ~ For topping:  1/2 medium pineapple, peeled, quartered lengthwise, and cored (..or 1 can crushed pineapple, if prefered..)  3/4 stick unsalted butter  3/4 cup packed light brown sugar  ~ For batter:  1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour  2 to 3 teaspoons ground cardamom  2 teaspoons baking powder  1/4 teaspoon salt  3/4 stick unsalted butter, softened  1 cup granulated sugar  2 large eggs  1 teaspoon vanilla  1 tablespoon dark rum  1/2 cup unsweetened pineapple juice  2 tablespoons dark rum for sprinkling over cake  - Special equipment: a well-seasoned 10-inch cast-iron skillet     how to:  Preheat oven to 350F.  -- Make topping:  Cut pineapple crosswise into 3/8-inch-thick pieces. Melt butter in skillet. Add brown sugar and simmer over moderate heat, stirring, 4 minutes. Remove from heat. Arrange pineapple on top of sugar mixture in concentric circles, overlapping pieces slightly.    -- Make batter:  Sift together flour, cardamom, baking powder, and salt. Beat butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, then gradually beat in granulated sugar. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla and rum. Add half of flour mixture and beat on low speed just until blended. Beat in pineapple juice, then add remaining flour mixture, beating just until blended. (Batter may appear slightly curdled.)     Spoon batter over pineapple topping and spread evenly. Bake cake in middle of oven until golden and a tester comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Let cake stand in skillet 5 minutes. Invert a plate over skillet and invert cake onto plate (keeping plate and skillet firmly pressed together). Replace any pineapple stuck to bottom of skillet. Sprinkle rum over cake and cool on plate on a rack.     Serve cake just warm or at room temperature.    !!! - 3 teaspoons of cardamom might look too much but i love this intense flavor. ;)  ** Cake may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Bring to room temperature before serving, though.    ``  FRESHLY FLAVOURED PINEAPPLE UPSIDE DOWN CAKE :  -- Caramel:  3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar  2 oz. (4 Tbs.) butter  -- Fruit:  1 small, ripe pineapple, trimmed, quartered, cored, and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices (...or crushed...)  -- Cake:  8 oz. (2 cups) cake flour  2-1/2 tsp. baking powder  1/4 tsp. salt  4 oz. (8 Tbs.) unsalted butter, at room temperature  3/4 cup sugar  1-1/2 tsp. finely grated orange zest (or as much as your tastebudds like :)  1 tsp. vanilla extract  2 large eggs  2/3 cup plain nonfat yogurt    how to:  Heat the oven to 350F and lightly butter the sides of an 8-inch square pan.  ~ Make the caramel -- In a small saucepan, combine the brown sugar and butter. Cook over medium heat, stirring often, until the butter is melted and the mixture is smooth. Bring to a boil and pour into the prepared pan. Spread with a spatula to coat the bottom evenly. Scatter or arrange the pineapple slices evenly in the caramel, overlapping them slightly. Gently press the fruit into the caramel.  ~ Make the cake -- Sift together the cake flour, baking powder, and salt. In a medium bowl, beat the butter with an electric mixer until smooth. Gradually add the sugar and continue beating until fluffy and lighter in color, about 3 min. Beat in the orange zest and vanilla. Add the eggs one at a time, beating briefly after each addition. Sprinkle half of the flour mixture over the butter mixture and, on low speed, mix just until the flour disappears. Add the yogurt and mix until just blended. Gently mix in the remaining flour. Scoop large spoonfuls of batter onto the fruit; gently spread the batter evenly in the pan. Lightly tap the pan on the counter to settle the batter. Bake until the cake is golden brown and a pick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 min. Immediately run a paring knife around the inside edge of the pan. Set a flat serving plate on top of the pan and invert the cake. Let the inverted pan rest for about 5 min. to let the topping settle. Gently remove the pan and serve the cake warm or at room temperature.    ``|`|INPrlW6Maa	INGREDIENTS  3 tablespoons butter   1 (20 ounce) can crushed pineapple with juice   8 maraschino cherries   1/4 cup walnut halves   2/3 cup packed brown sugar   1/3 cup shortening   1/2 cup white sugar   1 egg   1 teaspoon vanilla extract   1 1/4 cups sifted cake flour   1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder   1/2 teaspoon salt   1/2 cup reserved pineapple juice       DIRECTIONS  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

I really like the Butter Recipe from Duncan Hines but any yellow cake mix is fine.    In the bottom of the cake pan, I dump in the crushed pineapples, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and half a stick of melted butter.  If you like pineapple, which we do, I also throw in a handful of it, too.  Dot the whole thing with your maraschino cherries, pour in the cake batter and bake it as the directions state.  I've found that I usually have to bake it an extra 5 minutes or so.    Good luck and I hope you try this! It's really good :)|`|CnBMe52naa	Dump Cake     1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix   1 (15 ounce) can crushed pineapple   1 (16.5 ounce) can pitted dark sweet cherries   1/2 cup butter     Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

4de3da5babb437b65a9e55c075cdbbdeaa	Do you eat a good breakfast too?  You mentioned the weight loss yoga, why not ask your mum for smaller portions of the evening meal.  As long as you've eaten well during the day, even nutritionists recommend not having a huge dinner as your heaviest meal since it's right before bed.  Just eat slow and take small bites and really savor the smaller portion just to round out your food for the day.|`|1wNsBNmxaa	do you eat a big lunch that mite have something to do with it i had lunch today at noon in i am not hungry my self either i sometimes don't eat dinner not in till about 7pm at night i do not eat the same times as my mom & dad in sisters do       Relic66~~?|`|BOHi9zfcaa	Eat less during the day or exercise beforehand to speed up your metabolism|`|Rnaub4P6aa	well what you need to do is eat slowly your mind wont know that your hungry or full until at least 20 minutes after you eat.|`|Ww8nQ7rqaa	it could be a metabolism problem, go see a nutritionist.|`|bBqbkUkmaa	Well try having a lighter lunch.

L2jPYlbdaa	If you have a big cooking pot, you can pour 2 Tablespoons of vegetable oil in the bottom of it, set the heat to medium, pour in the kernels from the microwave bag and pop it on the stove top.  Make sure you keep a lid on the pot and keep the pot moving around once the corn starts popping. Once the popping noises slow down, remove it from the heat, then drizzle with melted butter and sprinkle on the salt    Enjoy!|`|uXsqZLoiaa	you probably can.|`|73bc3f33677a0f4fb63d38445d203ec8aa	open the bag empty ingredients in a pot with a little oil in the bottom, heat until done popping.

LGidAYDwaa	You can add one Tablespoon of sugar for each ounce of the Baker's (unsweetened) chocolate that you use. For example, to substitute 4 ounces of Baker's chocolate for 4 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate, you'd add 4 Tablespoons of sugar.    http://www.recipelink.com/mf/0/75151|`|MIx1fSbdaa	Baker's as in the brand? They have several types. Make sure you don't have semi-sweet.  Semi-sweet has added sugar and vanilla. If you have unsweetened, I'd just add a little sugar and vanilla.

xKuWE9gfaa	The word "bain marie" means literally "Mary's bath" and comes from medieval alchemists who invented a method of slow heating in a double walled container filled with water. In principle, a bain marie is a double saucepan, for slow heating food or keeping food warm once it has been cooked. There are 2 types of bains maries - dry heat or wet heat. In wet units, dishes sit over a bath of heated water while in dry units the elements heat the air beneath the dishes.  The temperature is set by thermostatic control available on some models or simmerstat control.. Thermostat controlled bains marie are the most suitable choice for holding hot food such as fillings, toppings and sauces. The right temperature is very important for storage of cooked food. The simmerstat does not maintain food temperature but controls power output. When using a simmerstat controlled unit more frequent temperature checks are required. Low temperatures are dangerous; excessive temperatures waste energy and overcook the food.|`|8nmEXGctaa	A bain marie is a hot water bath for keeping sauces and food items hot.|`|eiJOdPgxaa	Gentle oven heat - for instance, a whole fish gently poached.|`|ToztjpAsaa	It's really a water bath - a pan of boiling water over which you place another pan or a bowl.

This is dish placed into another filled with water.

U3ZBUOWaaa	Unless it is dry I would steam it.  Run some hot water over it first (and then drain) before throwing it in the wok.|`|4de3da5babb437b65a9e55c075cdbbdeaa	Don't reheat it first.  The best fried rice is made with cold rice so it fries and doesn't get mushy.

Then add the cold rice to the hot oil, being careful not to let it splatter on you. Stir fry the rice for a few minutes till it's coated in oil and heated through. Then add your eggs,veggies, seasonings, etc. You want to use the rice cold so it fries on the outside surface. Otherwise it will get mushy from too much water, plus it's dangerous to add watery stuff to hot oil....|`|AA11685844	Throw it in the wok with a tablespoon or so of water. Stir ove high heat for a few seconds to loosen it back up. The add your veggies and soy and stir fry some more until hot through and fragrant.|`|iYdTFoNWaa	I leave the rice in the steamer instead of putting it in the fridge, but I would microwave just to warm it up a little bit.|`|uTxjdidgaa	Use a thin wok - thin woks are better because it could spread the heat much faster and is more effiecient    Heat the Wok before anything - this makes cooking easier (think of the wok works like oil that inducts heat)    When wok is already heated enough:  Put the oil and saute also put the COLD rice fast  (dont heat the oil as much because the rice would absorbed it and the Wok does the transferring of heat itself) - And you need to use COLD rice so it wouldn't stick

5zNwBQZHaa	The Durian I have been able to get here (US/Oregon) is frozen, so I don't think the cold will hurt it much.  Ive seen the store keep the frozen Durian in a freezer case, and since they don't sell very many I think they may last in there for months.    I did some reading on them - and there are several different species and the one that gets shipped overseas is the one that keeps the best when frozen.  So assuming you are not in a country where they are grown - what you probably get are OK for cold storage.    I also noticed that freezing keeps the odor down.  As they begin to thaw they get more fragrant.     I also read that once they are opened - you need to refrigerate it and consume with 1-2 days.    Although I will be the first to admit I have no idea how to tell if a durian has gone bad, considering their considerable smell when fresh!|`|cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	I am a former chef and worked in Singapore and am a fan of durian, they freeze them to ship them to the west, and it will not go bad, you can take it out of the Durian shell, wrap it in plastic and foil, and freeze the flesh, it will keep for some time, but if the whole durian has no breaks then it can remain that way for a while.|`|jH9e7MYkaa	Remove the flesh from the shell, wrap and freeze to keep it longer. In the ref/cold place, it can stay good for 2-3 days (I think).    Once the shell shows some crack and remains unopened, it will start to spoil.   You'll know when it has turned bad..it starts to be a bit watery, color will show some reddish shade, and the taste will go sour.|`|ZVYY7nOlaa	My parents wrap it with plastic and put it in the freezer.

Or, steamed broccoli and cauliflower with butter, salt, pepper and sharp cheddar cheese.    Or I make fried rice with leftover brown rice. Just put a little oil in a saute pan or wok and add the rice once the pan is hot. Stir the rice so the oil coats it and it gets heated through (about 5 minutes over medium heat). Move the rice to one side of the pan. Beat and egg or two and pour that on the other side of the pan. Scramble the eggs till they are cooked through. Remove the pan from the heat and sprinkle chopped veggies on top. Cover and let sit for 5-10 minutes to allow the veggies to steam a bit. Some veggies that I like to use are peas, snow peas, bean sprouts, green onion, white onion, mushrooms, celery, carrots, etc. Just be sure to cut them fairly small so they cook through enough. Then I mix everything together and add some soy sauce to taste and sprinkle with some toasted sesame seeds.|`|SehQJ3Kjaa	Brown some onions,green peppers,mushrooms and browned maple breakfast sausages The maple gives it a good sweet taste|`|AA11685844	Rice wine vinegar, green onions, and slivered almonds.

qkYv5c6uaa	If you don't open & close the door - which lets out all the cold air, then the food should last several hours.  When our power went out last year, the food kept all night - about 10 hours.  Now, some people may be squeamish about meats or dairy products being left that long, but I will eat pretty much anything.  Also it was still cool when I opened the door in the morning.    If you have a thermometer in the fridge, you can check it to see what temp it is when the power comes back on.

Chick peas are a good example. also any kind of nut is good as well. im a culinary arts major and in a nutrition class right now and we just covered protein. You don't want to put to much protein into any person though because over time protein builds up and gets stored as fat. most people only need about 10 oz. total per day. any thing over that is past the recommended daily intake. there are more types of prtein than a lot of people know. Vegetables also contain protein, green ones mostly. dont just think meat.

Primero se prepara el "pino", La masa: se cierne la harina en una tabla de madera, se forma una corona y se le pone el aceite caliente y se mezcla con una cuchara ( de madera) luego se le va agregando la salmuera (caliente) y cuando este muy bien mezclado, se comienza a amasar. Se uslerea hasta dejar la masa en una lamina muy finita. Se corta una lamina (como para poner 3 empanaditas) y se le pone: 1 cucharada de pino, de a 3 o 4 pasas, una "lunita" de huevo duro, 1 o 2 aceitunas. Luego alrededor de cada porcin se humedece con agua tibia (con los dedos) y se tapa (el estilo es como cuando uno dobla una sabana ?con la humedad se pega mejor la masa y ah se cortan las 3 empanadas, cuyos bordes se van doblando hacia adentro.

Con Harina de Trigo: El agua debe estar TIBIA la cantidad depender de las empanadas que quieras hacer siempre empiezo con una taza de agua, sal al gusto, mantequilla suave que se derrita por el calor del agua, a?ades harina poco a poco y remueves, esta masa va a filtrar mas harina que la anterior as que puede que necesites mas agua a medida que vas amasando, debes amasar hasta que esta se despegue del molde y puedas trabajarla en un mesn o mrmol bien enharinado, sabemos que esta perfecta cuando al estirarla puedes cortarla y fcilmente volverla a unir al montn, djala reposar media hora tapada con pa?o y esta por efecto del oxigeno se expandir, a medida que la trabajas mejoras tu tcnica.|`|4fc5d08f91c7974cd568120518ffd480aa	Ya "THE QUEEN" te dio 2 opciones .Suerte!|`|hmUKseOwaa	Solo para masa?   si es asi:  1 kilo de harina  1/8 manteca  2 cucharaditas de polvos de hornear   2 tazas de salmuera    Preparacion:    La harina se coloca sobre una tabla de amasar, en el centro se agrega manteca derretida, tiene que estar tibia, enseguida a?ade la salmuera tibia   amasar hasta que la masa este suave y luego mesclar los ingredientes    bye|`|HqtXABxZaa	deverias de especificar si quieres las de dulce o los antojitos

HWZbtQo7aa	Pour 6 personnes :  Prparation : 30 min  Cuisson : 1h30            Ingrdients :      Pour les quantits de lgumes, il n'y a pas limites, selon l'apptit et le go?t de chacun. Mais, il y a des lgumes qui ne font pas partie d'un couscous traditionnel tel que l'aubergine ou les haricots verts (chez nous en Tunisie).  Disons pour 6 personnes :     1 kg de semoule (moi, je prfre la fine)  4 pommes de terre (+ pour les amateurs)  4 carottes  1 petit potiron  4 oignons  3 courgettes  1 petit choux blanc  6 piments doux  Pois chiches tremps la veille  1 Kg de viande d'agneau (je prfre un gigot d'agneau)  Huile d'olive  Sel, poivre, 4 pices, harissa  1 petite boite de concentr de tomate          Prparation :      Je commence par la viande, je la coupe en morceaux rguliers et dans un fait tout, je les fais mariner avec les pices (pour le poivre, sel et 4 pices c'est  volont). J'ajoute une cuillere  caf de harissa et l'huile d'olive et je le laisse de c?t le temps de prparer mes lgumes.     Je nettoie tous mes lgumes. Attention, je laisse les pommes de terre avec leur peau.  J'pluche les carottes, les courgettes, les oignons, je les laisse en entiers, je ne coupe que le potiron en 2 et le choux blanc en 2 (pour qu'ils ne prennent pas place dans le couscoussier).     Je commence par mettre ma viande ainsi marine + une bonne rasade de l'huile d'olive + un oignon grossirement minc dans le couscoussier, et je les fais revenir 5 minutes. J'ajoute 1 petit verre d'eau et je mets ma petite boite de concentr de tomate et je laisse mijoter 3 minutes.  J'ajoute encore un petit verre d'eau et je mets les piments, je continue la cuisson encore 5 minutes. N'oubliez pas de mettre le couvercle  chaque fois.     Je retire mes piments. Et l, je mets une bonne casserole d'eau, les pois chiches et le restant des lgumes  part le potiron et les courgettes, la sauce doit couvrir les lgumes. Je laisse le tout cuire et je prpare ma semoule.     Dans une grande jatte, je verse ma semoule, j'ajoute de l'eau tide sale et 1 petit verre d'huile dessus et je fais bien rentrer cette mixture dans les graines (c'est important cette opration pour que les grains de couscous ne collent pas durant la cuisson). Je ne lave pas ma jatte, j'en aurai encore besoin.     Ds que la sauce commence  bouillonner, je place ma semoule ainsi prparer dans le dessus du couscoussier (le panier trou) en tunisien c'est le keskes, et je mets bien mon couvercle. Ds que la vapeur commence  se pointer, j'enlve mon couvercle de peur que les grains ne se collent, et j'essaie d'arer la semoule avec une grosse cuillre en bois.  Aprs 15 minutes de cuisson, j'enlve le dessus du couscoussier et je remets la semoule dans la jatte. Je refais la mme opration avec de l'eau chaude et l'huile d'olive que je verse sur la semoule et je laisse un peu reposer, le temps d'enlever mes pommes de terre et mes carottes s'ils sont cuits et d'ajouter les potirons et courgettes et peut-tre un peu d'eau.  Quand ? bouillonne de nouveau, je replace la semoule dans le dessus du couscoussier et je laisse cuire encore 15 minutes.     A la fin, je verse ma semoule dans une grande jatte. Je fais un petit tour de poivre dessus. J'enlve tous mes lgumes du couscoussier et je rectifie le sel.  A la surface, le nectar de la sauce remonte, avec une louche je le recueille et je le verse dlicatement sur les grains, c'est la premire opration et je mlange bien dans la semoule.  Aprs, j'arrose gnreusement par 4  5 louches la semoule et je laisse reposer.     Entre-temps, je m'occupe de mes lgumes, je coupe mes pommes de terres en 4, mes carottes en 2 ou 4 selon la prfrence, courgette en 2 puis en 4.  Je reviens  ma semoule, je mlange bien et puis j'ajoute encore 4 bonnes louches de sauce. Je laisse reposer.     Servir :  Je m'occupe de ma viande, je la mets dans une assiette.

On peut donc en faire beaucoup et ne rien perdre (et vitez de devoir finir les restes toute la semaine)    En entre : gratin de fruits de mer (en sauce, vous faites une bchamel en rempla?ant le lait par de la bisque de homard). Vous mettez dans un plat les mlanges de fruits de mer (moules, petits coquilles st jacques, crevette, calamar), vous mettez la sauce gnreusement, chapelure sur le dessus et au four. Pour des gros mangeurs, ?a sera une mise en bouche.  Autre choix plus simple : des queues de langouste ou grosses crevettes, servies avec des oeufs durs et une macdoine mayonnaise (les gros mangeurs se serviront largement en macdoine et les oeufs durs ?a cale)    Plat principal : il y a plusieurs possibilits  - un aligot  - un pot au feu avec, en sus des lgumes traditionnels, des tagliatelles fraiches  - un poulet au paprika, au riz et aux courgettes  - une grosse cote de boeuf, ou plusieurs avec des pommes de terre dauphine et des courgettes sautes.    Le poulet ou dinde d'ailleurs : vous achetez des escalopes, vous dcoupez en bouche. Vous faites revenir avec un oignon (ou deux, selon la quantit de poulet) mince dans une cocotte. Vous mettez une ou deux grosse cuil de farine, vous mlangez. Ensuite, vous laissez cuire la viande en la couvrant mais en surveillant. ?a va assez vite. Ds que c'est cuit, vous balancez  de la crme fraiche (elle va se mler avec la farine cuite pour faire une sauce onctueuse). Vous rajoutez du paprika. Vous pouvez aussi rajouter des champignons (de paris ou sauvage)  Vous servez dans une couronne de riz et avec des courgettes sautes dans un plat  cot.

1e82dae8f6b679376a248673b3e1a073aa	Halala... la nature, la Nature... elle a bon dos...    C'est marrant quand mme que la viande soit l'un des seuls domaines pour lequel les humains se rfrent au sacro-saint "ordre naturel" de la sainte "cha?ne alimentaire"... pour justifier et poursuivre les barbaries commises sur les animaux.  Schizophrnie? Psychopathie? illogisme en tout cas --> (non, je ne suis pas mdecin), je m'explique :     Pourtant, on  parle de culture, de progrs quand on a russi  radiquer les grandes maladies, qui pourtant constituent un moyen naturel de rguler la population humaine galopante. Puisqu'il dtruit les organismes les plus faibles, les empche de se reproduire, et renforce ainsi les espces. Et cependant on lutte contre cela, mme si c'est naturel!     L'humain a besoin de prothses pour pouvoir se dclarer "prdateur" : armes, piges... parce que ses "armes naturelles" ses petits ongles aiguiss, ses dents saillantes, ses muscles ultra dvelopps ne lui sont bien s?r pas suffisants pour tuer tous les animaux dont il se rclame le prdateur : la vache, cheval, cochon, ....  ainsi, au pire, il se trouve  leur niveau dans la "chaine alimentaire"...     Mais il se dfend en arguant que la nature lui a donn le cerveau qui le rend capable d'laborer des stratgies, et en l'occurrence des stratgies pour dtruire ou torturer ses semblables ainsi que les autres cratures...  Esprit tordu... Fourbe et lache cet humain!    Quant aux gens qui justifient la consommation de viande en disant "les plus forts mangent les plus faibles" sont bien contents de vivre dans une socit "d'galit de droits" , ou "chacun a sa chance"... lorsqu'ils se trouvent dans la peau du faible, l, direct ils veulent combattre la nature... et faire appel  des lois contre-nature....  Egocentristes! Ego?stes!!    Et puis quand on leur dmontre que toutes ces barbaries ne sont pas naturelles, alors direct ces gens vont se rfugier derrire le "on l'a toujours fait" : ah, ?a, c'est un argument de taille pour continuer!!!!  Allez dire aux personnes qui luttent contre l'excision que ?a va jamais s'arrter puisque ?a s'est "toujours fait"!!   et puis comme le dit Isaac Bashevis Singer (1904-1991) "Les gens rptent souvent que depuis toujours les hommes ont mang des animaux, comme justification pour continuer cette pratique. En suivant cette logique, nous ne devons pas essayer dempcher les individus de tuer dautres personnes, puisque cela aussi se fait depuis la nuit des temps."    ...    ne serait-il pas temps d'voluer??? 2008, XXIe sicle les gars...    devenez vgtarien, c'est votre destin!!

Comme vous, je ne vois la cha?ne alimentaire comme une image (assez floue d'ailleurs) d'une ralit. Par contre, j'en dgage quand mme une rgle que l'on ne peut pas transgresser : tout tre vivant doit manger pour vivre ! Et (presque ?) tous serviront  faire vivres d'autres tres vivants.    Ce n'est pas parce que la souris est un maillon qui prcde le renard que ce dernier doit absolument en intgrer dans son rgime alimentaire. Il pourrait trs bien faire le fin gourmet et ne manger que des musaraignes et des gerbilles (et quelques insectes pour le go?ter).      PS:  J'avoue que j'ai eu un peu prs la mme raction que le curiste dont vous faites allusion : la premire raction que j'ai eu en lisant votre rponse a t : "Et ben ! Toutes les occasions sont bonnes !"      _____    Cuire de la viande n'est pas naturel, mais utiliser son cerveau, si. Je ne suis pas convaincu que l'Homme  ces dbut tait exclusivement frugivore. Je n'est bien s?r pas la prtention de pouvoir dcrire son rgime initial, mais je pense qu'il se nourrissait aussi de viande : les insectes  l'image de nombreuses tributs amazoniennes ne mangeant comme viande que des insectes et des araignes. Puis sa curiosit lui a fait go?ter la viande cuite et son intelligence lui a permit d'en fabriquer. Je trouve ceci, tout  fait naturel.    Pour Fissomad :  1) Nos armes (celle que vous dcrivez) nous suffisent pour chasser des petits animaux (insectes, arachnides, gastropodes, ...). nous pouvions donc, ds nos origines, manger de la viande.   2) Le cerveau fait parti de nos armes. C'est mme la plus dangereuse ! Et nous ne somme pas les seuls  l'utiliser.|`|naG67Reuaa	En plus des rponses prcdentes, c'est le besoin pour l'tre humain de manger de la viande. Personnellement moi, je n'arrive pas  manger des lgumes sans viande car il manquerait quelque chose.

Mais bon aprs c'est chacun sa thorie.|`|Z3kXbI2haa	Quel honneur ! ;-)  Bon plus srieusement, je suis d'accord avec toi, la cha?ne alimentaire est un modle descriptif et non pas un dogme. Ce que moi je ne comprends pas, c'est que tu rfutes l'ide mme que depuis des millnaires, l'homo sapiens et ses anctres ont mang de la viande de manire "naturelle", s'inscrivant donc dans cette cha?ne alimentaire.    D'une part, je suis d'accord (je me rpte non ?) qu'il y a bien des abus, et que la socit occidentale consomme trop de viande. Qu'il est possible, avec certaines connaissances, de s'affranchir de manger de la viande sans souffrir d'aucune carence.    D'autre part, tu affirmes que l'homme est frugivore par constitution. Cet argument premptoire repose sur quoi ? Quelle preuve scientifique as-tu ? Mme une simple thorie, je serais preneur. Mais je n'en ai pas connaissance. C'est pourquoi je trouve cet argument spcieux.    Nous faisons donc face  un dsaccord profond (qui a dit insoluble ?) quant  la nature de l'homme. Selon moi, il est clair que l'Homme est omnivore, en cela qu'il a mang de la viande depuis les premiers stades de sa longue volution. Et que par consquent, la constitution anatomique de l'homo sapiens est une consquence de sa consommation de viande. Ma thorie repose sur des faits scientiques, historiques. Je ne connais pas trs bien Darwin, mais je pense qu'on pourrait l'associer  une pense comme celle que je viens d'noncer. Et c'est pourquoi j'ai mentionn la cha?ne alimentaire. J'espre que tu comprends ma position  la lumire de mes explications.    Petit ajout: quand tu lis le post de Fissomad, qu'est ce que tu peux penser franchement ? Schizophrnie, psychopathie dans le premier ... J'ai mme pas pris la peine de lire la suite. Non seulement c'est insultant d'associer des pathologies mentales aux mangeurs de viande, mais plus simplement, cette personne est-elle mdecin pour pouvoir avancer de telles hypothses ?

1a348ab0340b840f21ab2784d4cc3657aa	EVOO = extra virgin olive oil. The freshest first pressing of the olive. Regular olive oil may not be first pressed quality or be chemically processed/refined.    Extra-virgin olive oil comes from the first pressing of the olives, contains no more than 0.8% acidity, and is judged to have a superior taste. There can be no refined oil in extra-virgin olive oil.   Virgin olive oil has an acidity less than 2%, and judged to have a good taste. There can be no refined oil in virgin olive oil.   Olive oil is a blend of virgin oil and refined virgin oil, containing at most 1% acidity. It commonly lacks a strong flavor.

Plus it is good for you.|`|Zmx40Nnpaa	Labels such as virgin, extra virgin and pure are used to categorize olive oils according to their acidity. Virgin olive oil is the first pressing of the olives with an acidity level no higher than three percent. To receive the virgin label, however, the oil must not be further processed by heat or chemicals. Extra virgin olive oil is the first pressing of the olives with an acidity level no higher than one percent, and no heat or chemical processing. Both virgin and extra virgin olive oils are considered 100% unadulterated olive oil. Pure olive oil is extracted with heat and chemicals from the pulps, or solids, left behind after the first pressing. Virgin olive oils are said to have better flavor then pure olive oil, which is also less expensive.

I know many recipes add raw egg--perhaps this makes your mixture too sloppy to hold its shape?  Make sure your mince mixture isn't too wet, if you add soaked bread be sure to squeeze water out thoroughly, or add dry bread crumbs.    I have a special gadget from tupperware (I don't own shares!) which helps shape burgers, I don't know if they still sell it.  And where are you cooking the burgers?  I often just put the shaped patties on an oiled shallow baking tray and cook them in the middle of a moderately hot oven, they don't even need turning.  Good luck

Por esta razn, qu mejor que aprovechar las vacaciones de verano para adquirir este hbito tan saludable y no dejar de practicarlo el resto del a?o.     Dos milenios despus, la hora sexta (hora de la siesta) de los romanos podra volver a ponerse de moda gracias a la ciencia. Segn los resultados de diversas investigaciones, por ejemplo una publicada en la revista estadounidense Archives of Internal Medicine, la costumbre de echarse la siesta despus de comer reduce la mortalidad coronaria en un tercio. Los resultados de esta investigacin estn avalados por otro estudio realizado por cientficos griegos en el que se constata que la siesta puede ayudar a combatir el riesgo de enfermedades cardiovasculares.    Otros beneficios que aporta la siesta son:      Mejora la salud en general y la circulacin sangunea.   Previene el agobio, la presin y el estrs.   Favorece la memoria y los mecanismos de aprendizaje.   Mejora el rendimiento por las tardes.    Unos pocos minutos bastan  La siesta ms recomendable es la que oscila entre los 10 minutos y la hora. Dormir ms tiempo del aconsejado puede trastocar el reloj biolgico natural y causar insomnio por la noche, adems de alterar de forma negativa el estado de nimo y el rendimiento.    Echar una cabezadita despus de comer es una costumbre ms que saludable, tanto es as que varias empresas en todo el mundo estn permitiendo a sus trabajadores breves descansos a medio da. Empresas como Nike o Yarde Metals se han tomado tan en serio estos estudios cientficos que han creado los nap lounges (salones de siesta) para sus empleados. Otros pases como Alemania, Francia o Japn han continuado con esta iniciativa con el fin de mejorar la productividad y, por lo tanto, los resultados de la tarde.|`|0SNaxSW3aa	Es malo.

Certains diots sont consomms cuits : grills, bouillis mais traditionnellement ils sont cuits au vin blanc. D'autres sont secs.  Ils peuvent tre dgusts chauds ou froids. Chauds, ils s'accompagnent, en gnral, de pommes de terre cuites  l'eau, de crozets ou de polenta. Froids, ils se consomment avec de la moutarde, ou tranchs dans une salade ou un sandwich.    Voici une recette :  Diots au vin blanc  Pour 4 Personne(s)  Temps de prparation : 1 h   Temps de cuisson : 45 min   Ingrdients :  diot : 8   beurre : 100 g   oignon : 2   chalote : 3   bouquet garni (persil, thym, laurier) : 1   vin blanc sec : 2 dl   farine : 1 c.  soupe   sel, poivre     Prparation :  Faites dorer les diots  la pole pendant environ 15 mn.  Dans une casserole avec 100 g de beurre, faites revenir les chalotes et les oignons mincs.  Lorsque c'est bien dor, saupoudrez avec la farine et mouillez avec le vin blanc.  Laissez paissir  feu doux en remuant avec une cuiller en bois.  Ajoutez les diots qui doivent tre recouverts par la sauce.  Ajoutez le bouquet garni et laissez mijoter au moins 45 mn  feu doux.

wfqTRGWgaa	La bire vient du fond des ages, elle est probablement la boisson alcoolise la plus vieille au monde.   Son histoire commence en Msopotamie, dans les sables de Sumer, vers 4000 av J-C. Cette rgion se situe entre le Tigre et lEuphrate.           Puis cest en Chalde et en Syrie que les chercheurs ont dcouvert les premiers documents archologiques sur les boissons fermentes  base de grains.         Les Msopotamiens appelaient la bire la ? Sikaru ?.     La ? Sikaru ? tait le rsultat dune fermentation sur un mo?t provenant dun malt dorge et dpeautre que lon aromatisait avec une pice : la cannelle.   De Babylonie, la bire arriva en Egypte o elle fut appele ? Zythum ? qui signifie   ? vin dorge ?.      Dorigine divine la bire bnficia de la double protection de la desse ISIS (desse de lorge) et dOSIRIS (dieu du Soleil). Cette boisson tait utilise lors des crmonies religieuses et en particulier lors des crmonies funraires.   Les brasseurs Egyptiens macraient une mouture dorge, additionne de mie de pain fermente et aromatise par une infusion de lupin. La naissance des premires brasseries date de cette poque.  La bire traversa la Mditerrane et arriva en Espagne o elle prit le nom de ? Celia ? ou de ? Ceria ?.      Rome puis la Grce connurent  leur tour cette boisson.Malheureusement pour elle, elle ne connut pas le succs espr. La bire ne put y vincer le vin, car ni les Grecs, ni les Romains ne sont parvenus  shabituer au go?t de la bire.   De Rome, elle fut exporte en Gaule o les Celtes lui donnrent le nom de ? Cervoise ?, qui vient de CERES, desse des moissons. Les Gaulois, quant  eux la baptisrent ? Korma ?.       En Gaule, la bire tait alors produite par les femmes dans leur chaumire et elle tait ensuite stocke dans des tonneaux en bois (invention gauloise).       Elle tait fabrique  partir dune infusion a base de grains dorge germs, mlangs avec du bl, du seigle et de lavoine.  Il a fallu attendre le Moyen-Age pour que la bire devienne cette vritable boisson populaire.    Jusqu la fin du XIIme sicle, avant   lapparition des brasseries artisanales, les moines rgnaient en tant que ma?tres sur le commerce de la bire.      Une lgende raconte quils profitaient de leur statut de confesseur pour soutirer des informations secrtes sur la fabrication de la boisson. Cette mme bire brasse dans les monastres servait de mdicament.   Cette boisson liquide tait un moyen prventif contre les pidmies transmises par leau non bouillie.       Cest en 1259 quappara?t le premier brasseur de mtier.    La brasserie artisanale ne va cesser de se dvelopper en France et en Europe, dautant que la concurrence nest plus aussi prsente du fait que lEglise favorise la culture viticole et la consommation de vin au dtriment de la bire   Ce nest quau XVme sicle que lutilisation du houblon dans la fabrication de la bire va prendre toute son ampleur.      Lusage du houblon en tant qu ar?me principal de la bire ne sera impos quen 1435 par Jean Sans Peur, duc de Bourgogne.       L est la vritable naissance de la bire (ainsi que celle du mot) avec un go?t et une saveur stabilise qui est devenue celle que lon apprcie aujourdhui.    A la fin du XIXme sicle, les dcouvertes de Pasteur sur les ensemencements par cellules pures de levure et linvention des machines frigorifiques permettent un essor considrable de la bire.    http://pagesperso-orange.fr/lyceechatele...|`|Z3kXbI2haa	Beaucoup d'lments cits plus haut sont intressants. Gambrinus est en effet le Saint Patron des brasseurs ! Mais la bire date de beaucoup plus longtemps...

Spoonful*<br>  2 teaspoons baking powder<br>  1/8 teaspoon salt<br>  1 cup orange juice<br>  4 tablespoons stick butter or margarine, melted<br>  1 large egg, slightly beaten<br>  1 teaspoon grated orange peel<br>  <br>   Lightly coat 9 muffin cups with nonstick spray or line with paper-liners; set aside.<br>  Combine flour, Equal?, baking powder and salt in a large bowl.<br>  Stir in orange juice, melted butter, egg and orange peel until all ingredients are just moistened.<br>  Spoon batter into muffin cups, filling 2/3 full.<br>  Bake in preheated 375°F oven 20 to 25 minutes or until wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool in pan 10 minutes. Remove muffins from pan and cool on wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Orange Juice Muffins<br>  <br>  <br>      * 2 cups whole wheat flour<br>      * 1 teaspoon baking soda<br>      * 1/2 teaspoon salt<br>      * 1/3 cup sugar<br>      * 1 teaspoon grated orange rind (optional)<br>      * 1 cup orange juice<br>      * 1 medium egg<br>      * 1/3 cup oil<br>  <br>  In a large bowl combine the flour, baking soda, salt, sugar and the orange rind, if you choose to use it. Mix these together with a fork or a whisk to make sure the ingredients are evenly distributed. Pour in the orange juice, crack in the egg, and measure in the oil. Stir the mixture up so that all the flour is moistened by the wet ingredients. Don't over mix it; the batter should still be lumpy. Turn the batter into 16 or 18 well oiled muffin cups and bake at 400° for about 20 minutes. When they are nicely browned on top, remove them from the oven and allow to cool slightly. They may be eaten right away for breakfast or a snack, or you may frost them with the following concoction:<br>  <br>  Simple Frosting:<br>  <br>      * 1 cup powdered sugar<br>      * 1 1/2 tablespoons milk<br>      * 1 teaspoon vanilla<br>      * 1/4 teaspoon almond extract (optional)<br>  <br>  Combine everything in a small bowl and drizzle over baked muffins. My kids prefer them with the frosting, so this is how we usually eat them. These also make excellent lunch box snacks.|`|53giV6PFaa	I love orange cranberry flavor combination.

f262cda35c3c0959f3b4089b38f0359faa	It really depends on the recipe you are referring to, and the answer to the question what is a 'ripe' banana?<br>  According to Chiquita there are seven color stages, ranging from all green to yellow flecked with brown. Most people like their bananas at color 5 which is yellow with green tips and green necks or color 6 which is all yellow except for light green necks. <br>  Bananas are harvested green and sweeten as they ripen. The more the progressed the stage, the sweeter & creamier the banana.<br>  If the bananas you buy aren't as ripe as you'd like, try sealing them in a brown paper bag with an apple or tomato overnight.|`|wPM6eBkWaa	Taste and texture will be different.  Ripe bananas mash/cook better in recipes and they offer a sweeter taste.  Might want to wait a day or two to make your recipe.|`|928d3c3f724692764257407068fe45d4aa	There will be a difference in the taste (ripe bananas are sweeter so the amount of sugar in the recipe may have to be increased if you're using unripe bananas) and in the texture (ripe bananas are softer and creamier).|`|53giV6PFaa	Yes.  Like said before ripen bananas are sweeter and a softer texture.  Bananas that aren't ripe are more bitter tasting IMO.  Here is a quick way to ripen your banana:<br>  <br>  You can place the bananas in a paper bag with an apple in it. Ethylene gas is emitted from the apple which gets trapped in the bag. With the help of that gas, the bundle of bananas will get ripened fast.  It will take about 24 hours to ripen enough to cook with.|`|AA11767076	It would make a difference in taste.  HOWEVER - you can quickly ripen a banana by sticking it in the freezer for a couple of hours & then letting it thaw out.|`|KGRikkJeaa	the riper the sweeter...if you use non ripe, add sugar...|`|eL268hETaa	If it's a banana bread yes it does matter.  The bananas for that need to be BLACK as is OVER-RIPE and smashed into mush with a fork.  It will make the recipe incredibly moist and sweet.  No way to get the same results with a firm greenish banana.|`|6AnhlCyQaa	it depends on what you are making.. if it is a smoothie then no it doesn't matter but if it is something like a dinner then i would recommend ripe.. just because it has a little more flavor... good luck!|`|mutANJ9paa	no

AA10861198	Do you have a good blender that can crush ice?  If not, you can use some frozen fruit (since it's not as hard as a solid ice cube.)<br>  <br>  A lot of fruity drinks use orange juice as the base, as it is very easy to find.<br>  <br>  Freshly squeezed tastes wonderful, but is expensive.  Not from concentrate juices, such as Tropicana, give good value and taste, while juices made from concentrate will be the cheapest.<br>  <br>  Bananas are cheap and easy to find, and make a great addition.  Freezing them beforehand is easy.<br>  <br>  Frozen berries are easy to find year-round, and in the summertime, farmers' markets can be a good source.<br>  <br>  Fresh whole pineapple can be cheaper than pre-cut pineapple, and is not that hard to break down if you have a good knife.  There are many tutorials online that show you the steps, either video or pictures.<br>  <br>  You can add fizz either with club soda or with any kind of pop, but a neutral lemon-lime or ginger ale will work best, as colas, root beers and other strongly-flavoured pops will interfere with the fruit juices.<br>  <br>  Using herbs and spices can really add another level of excitement.  Fresh herbs work best, such as mint and basil, because dried herbs aren't always fresh and might just be smelly dust.  Always try to get the freshest spices, whole if possible and grind yourself.  Cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger are sweet, while black pepper is a very adventurous ingredient.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to experiment.  There's nothing like tasting your own combinations to find out what works best for your own tongue.  I'm sure you can find plenty of volunteers to sample your trials.|`|WlFIXJSeaa	7-up Punch is one of the best and top preferred non-alcoholic beverages <br>   <br>  4 tbs cinnamon<br>  1/2 cup sugar<br>  2 cups water<br>  3 cups orange juice<br>  1/4 cup lemon juice<br>  1 cup pineapple juice<br>  2 liters 7-Up? soda|`|OcIYgqtyaa	<a href="http://www.drinksmixer.com/cat/8/" rel="nofollow">http://www.drinksmixer.com/cat/8/</a> check this out...there are 700 drinks and recipes.!!!!|`|BFWth8PMaa	there is a website i know calledsweet bird and it has all kind of recipes for none alchoholic drinks but if you still need some help type in cold drink recipes or non alchohlic drink recipes and you will have loads of sites come up bursting with ideas

cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	I am a former chef and worked in Asia and some Fish sauce or Nam Pla can be saltier than other, reducing the amount, adding a bit of water to the recipe is fine, the best thing is to mix it all together other than the the fish sauce, and then add it in stages until you get the flavour you want, it is not a written rule as to exact ingredients, even add a bit of sugar and grate some carrot into it, I happen to like the flavour of the sauce.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	No, just use less next time|`|7iPKgy5Caa	NO you  probably use to much|`|TAGsuqu2aa	Yes there is no harm in dilute the fish sauce a bit until you get the exact flavor that you want. There are many brands of fish sauce, some saltier than others. I suggest you next time work with one that is exactly how you would like it so you wouldn't have to dilute it with water to get the flavors. You also can try a little bit of vinegar to even out the fishy taste.
