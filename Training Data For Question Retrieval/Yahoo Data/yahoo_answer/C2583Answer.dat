Or otherwise feel loose?<br>  <br>  If not, you're fine.<br>  <br>  I don't trust those big chain stores.|`|DV4xyeChaa	signs of wear....shaking...wobble in turns...osculation after a bump,,,whats your complaint?|`|fIMzG1Ciaa	Symptoms of loose steering components will be "dead spots" in the steering, a drift in the steering (back and forth, left to right). Steering will also be "softer" than normal, but as joints wear over time, it can be hard to determine that the steering is "softer".<br>  <br>  Individual components, like tie rods ends would have to be inspected manually. This can be done by raising the front of the vehicle with the tires off the ground and manually pulling/pushing on the wheel/tire while looking at the component in question for visible slack.<br>  <br>  If your car goes down the road straight, the steering feels good and tight to you, the tires aren't wearing strangely, and you've already had all of the components replaced already, I wouldn't worry about it. Of course that also depends on what exactly you had replaced and how many miles ago.|`|r1rXE6Gtaa	If it's slightly worn there will be almost no way to tell without jacking the A-arm up and moving the wheel to check the play.

DNCunGOBaa	hard to say how much power gain there would be by fitting either but between 25 -50 bhp should be expected.<br>  Turbochargers work within a rev range ie from 2500 rpm -4500 rpm but superchargers provide a constant air induction from 1000rpm -8000rpm.|`|2Y2AFV7Kaa	I am not sure of the specific increase because other variables affect the power output of the engine but you could expect at least 100 bhp improvement. The difference between the two is as follows a turbo charger is powered usually by exhaust gases which is why you get turbo lag when accelerating A supercharger is driven directly from the engine so provides a constant power boost personally I would say a supercharger is better as there is no turbo lag|`|uzepqbXIaa	There is a fundamental difference.  Turbo charger is exhaust gas  driven and will give you a rush of power as it reaches full pressure, being exhaust driven they perform much better with an intercooler as inducted air should be cold, (cold air is more dense and burns better).<br>  <br>  Superchargers are generally less powerful, but generally more responsive.  They are belt driven directly from the revs of the engine.  You should take into consideration your manifolds and if you can afford the space for re-routing the exhaust.<br>  <br>  Either way, your intake manifolds need to be modified due to the change between negative air pressure to posotive/forced induction.  Also your ECU needs to be mapped as the engine is no longer sucking air, but now being force fed air.|`|tGUnM2XCaa	a centrifugal supercharger would be the easiest way to improve performance, you can push up to and beyond 300 bhp, just google superchargers, there are many companies that can sell chargers, usually ￡3,000+ but then you'll need someone to fit and tune it, even so it's easier than trying to turbocharge the car if it's naturally aspirated, because fitting turbos to na engines require modification to the exhaust, the compression ratio's etc... with a supercharger kit for the engine, in most cases you get the uprated injection kits for the fuel injection system as well.|`|GxapFaqtaa	super chargers work of the crank shaft and work at lower revs, turbo chargers work on medium revs from the excess fuel that did not burn in the cylinders and its caught between the engine and exhaust sent back in to be reburnt. if you have an intercooler, (normally on in this day and age) it cools the unburnt fuel getting more back into the enging so you get more horsepower.

3NoQuoWuaa	Here is a known fact in insurance circles. Guys don't let their gf's drive their cars. Girls allow their bf's to drive their car and they mostly total them out. Don't let this guy drive your car. If necessary see if your insurance company will exclude him since you are currently living there and tell him your insurance company required it. You will have no insurance if he drives your car. If he takes it you can charge him with theft.(Insurance companies have a strong dislike for the unnamed male driver of a female's auto. If they knew of his existence, they would want probably want him excluded anyway.)r|`|ogPmW1m1aa	Very true! My boyfriend seems to have taken my car over as well!

The sirens are there for a purpose.  It isn't for the criminals to know, but it is for all drivers that are in the way of the police officers to move.  Imagine a world without police sirens.  Most drivers don't pay attention as it is anyway.  If there were no sirens in use, the police officers wouldn't be able to alert drivers to get out of the way and it could cost the police officers a break in the case, which means no arrest and it could be the difference in a life or death.  No lights would mean no drivers moving out of the way.  So it has nothing to do with the criminals.  It has to do with drivers and citizens being alerted of the situation.|`|4ef759a72bd240232f7647985dcd2818aa	There can be a number of reasons.<br>  <br>  01. Clear traffic<br>  02.

LTlx22njaa	Though i do not now how your engine is set up, i have put a spectre intake in my toyota celica, and all it really was, was a couple of the tubing sections, one special one for air sensor, filter and a adaptor, so the tubing would fit on my engine.<br>  <br>  The only problem was the filter i got had no clamping system, but i just used an old clamp i had. but i do know most of there filters have clamps.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.  Good luck|`|mwu6aJuyaa	You need a filter, (cone filter) come clamps, and tubing. If the tube is not restrictive in there right now, just use the existing pipes and just get the right saize cone filter. One thing to remember, don't change the distance your Mass airflow sensor is from your intake manifold. it can screw things up if you do.

Start w/a fresh plug, check plug cap ohms (I believe its supposed to be between 9 & 12 thousand; dont qoute me on that tho! if the 4-W has been under-water or in deep mud, This can cause alot of corrosion; check all the connections for dried mud or green corrosion and clean the contacts; on the coil and even the neutral switch.  Check the batt terminals, make sure there clean and have a strong  contact. lastly check the ground from the starter to the engine off the negative terminal.

I am not that familiar with your particular make of vehicle, however a lot of cars have a serpentine belt that operates all of the pulleys on the motor, including the power steering. Should the spring on the belt tension er pulley become stuck it will also cause the belt to squeak. Check to see if it has a separate belt for the power steering, if so replace it. If it is a serpentine belt then  find the tension pulley, behind it there normally is a slot that allows for a lubricant to be sprayed on the tension er spring. Spray a good penetrating lubricant into the slot and then check your belt for abnormal wear. example- cracks, bald spots, missing V groove material.  If so, replace it.
0nmrjjXeaa	assuming that they must have checked the obvious, stuck open fuel injector, what is likely happening is that something in the tank that was swept up when the tank was emptied got caught and is putting limit pressure within a section of the line likely at a conection spot at certain intervals which is telling the computer to send more fuel, then the fuel is there and the blockage has stopped yet it doesn't reset till the battery is unplugged in the shop.  Which is why it runs fine for a while later.  <br>  Take off the fuel rail and detach line to tank. block all fuels injector rails, but one and use compressed air to blow it out backwords.  Do this with each port singly incase it is stuck in the port themselves. pull injectors at this time while it's apart and make sure there isn't any foreign matter in them.  Change the fuel filter as backword pressure could damage it. Have battery disconnected throughout this, so it is reset.<br>  The other thing it could be is a blockage in the return line, however i doubt this because you saidd it was running fine for a while.  This wouldn't go back and forth ussually as there is no high pressure and is not pressur regulated by the computer.|`|AA10230454	If it was me, I would just not waste anymore time or money on the car and go ahead and get a new one.|`|CWFtKTfPaa	contact the best saab guru I know.

GWC57NFiaa	Not really... usually dealer doesnt sell a car base on the invoice price. The negotiation is based on MSRP instead for New vehicle.<br>  For compact cars, lotta people pays couple hundred below the MSRP to walk out of the door... if it has a invoce at 15.4k, i assume its MSRP would be around 17.5K, which is what you paid to walk out of the door...

Since you live in CA, you had the OPTION of purchasing a "48 hour cooling off" period for around $150, so the $600 was a lie. But you said you got a 3 day return policy?

UdnNst4iaa	I don't want to dispute the information already provided by another post but here is my experience. Get in contact with an attorney ASAP. A personal injury lawyer will work on a contingency basis meaning you don't have to pay him unless you are successful in winning the case. Second, never take a settlement from an insurance company until you have consulted with a lawyer. Always remember like attorneys, insurance companies are set-up to make money!  It is the adjusters responsibility to pay you the least amount of money for damages including pain and suffering and its the attorneys responsibility to get you fair compensation for damages etc. Depending upon your situation here is a good list of things you should consider fighting for....<br>  <br>  medical expenses, loss of wages, loss of job (if it applies), cost of aides, cost of physical therapy, cost of counseling (if it applies), ongoing medical expenses related to the accident, pain and suffering, hospital bills, out of pocket expenses (such as mileage to and from physical therapy etc.)<br>  <br>  While you may not recover all these expense related to your accident your attorney should be ready to fight for full compensation!!!  <br>  <br>  Again, always remember the following: An insurance company wants to settle the claim out of court because there is a good chance you can receive more money if you are represented by an experience personal injury lawyer. Furthermore there first offer is seldomly their best offer!!!!|`|c7391e274aad7cb4a4f194346ed021cfaa	These questions usually don't supply enough for experienced claims people to say what their injury is worth. You didn't say where this happened for one thing. I agree with what the previous pie and chips person said (wonder where she works- maybe a caveman can figure that out) but to put it even more succinctly- this is not the lottery! You had a soft tissue injury and those do not have much value compared to when people get seriously hurt. So whatever your attorney tells you he is asking for know that he is not in the ballpark with his first demand, and the number your claim is worth probably won't be over 4 figures (so less than $10,000 pretty much and I DON'T mean $9,999)|`|jxDhbE31aa	You probably wont get near as much as you think and then your'e lawyer shouldnt get more than 25% if he didnt have to go to court (i'm sure he already had you sign for more)|`|d712654c27b31b0fdab1d03cbf2c959daa	Let me start by saying that I am glad, generally speaking, that you are ok.<br>  <br>  Honey, you have a lawyer for a reason. You're paying them 1/3 of your total settlement to figure this out for you. Do you really want a bunch of schmoes suggesting astronomical amounts and inflating your hopes/expectations???<br>  <br>  Pain and suffering are subjective, as are soft-tissue injuries (no broken bones, lacerations). These funds are to pay you for the general inconvenience the accident has caused you. The insurance co is going to look at the total amount of damage caused to the car and the dollar amount of your medical treatment to determine what they will pay out.<br>  <br>  Ask your attorney if he has calculated your bills in total. Ask him what he is seeking in bodily injury settlement. If you don't understand why he's asking for the amount he is, ask more questions. You're paying him, and he should have all of these answers for you.<br>  <br>  I don't even want to begin answering this with a dollar value because it would be unfair, and frankly, if your attorney is that lame maybe you either don't need one or need one who can answer these difficult questions more appropriately.<br>  <br>  ------<br>  Additionally, if some random jackhole comes into this forum and advises you to go out and get an MRI and a bunch of other crap not recommended by your doctor...stop...and think about why you didn't do this in the first place. Your doc is always going to look out for your health. Personal Injury attorneys everywhere would just love you to inflate your treatment in the hopes of a big payday. I pay these claims every day, and believe me, they always get their cut.

ee14e206dbb372dcb6ac973cd2828e69aa	I am not from Texas or Louisiana. I Live in Alabama, but I believe my answer will apply. For whatever reason, if you drive along the highways of the southern states, rocks get thrown up from the road. Windshields fracture more easily because of the thinness of the glass and the way they are mounted (no support molding) in vehicles today. You are fortunate that you did not get your windshield starred or cracked during your trip.
rgRz0O9Yaa	Hallo Elsemarie, du bist leider eine von wenigen, die im Stra?enverkehr rücksichtsvoll fahren und nicht immer nur an sich denken. Ich bin sehr viel als PKW-Fahrer unterwegs und stimme dir vollkommen zu. Meine Art ist zu fahren ?hnlich, wie die deine und ich merke immer wieder, dass es viele nicht n?tig haben sich zu bedanken. Mag sein, dass es in der heutigen, sehr unpers?nlichen Zeit nicht immer unfreundlich gemeint ist, aber sind wir nicht alle selber Schuld, wenn wir durch Stress und Hektik kaputt gehen? Vieles ist gar nicht n?tig und mit panischer Eile macht man alles nur noch schlimmer.<br>  Das Gleiche ist t?glich an den Supermarktkassen zu erleben.<br>  Wenn ich mal einen vorlasse und scherzhaft sage, dass ich Zeit habe, weil ich ja noch kein Rentner bin, gucken mich die Leute nur fassungslos an. Dann bekomme ich oft nicht mal ein L?cheln geschenkt und der/die geht einfach vor.<br>  Nur wir dürfen nicht den Fehler machen deswegen unser Verhalten zu ?ndern und keinen mehr reinwinken, denn dann werden die Hektiker und "Im Keller Lachenden" immer mehr und es gibt bald keine Freundlichkeit mehr.|`|311776b5a66a0727620aaf00257ecd5eaa	Einige Menschen sind sehr Ichbezogen im Stra?enverkehr, man kann es auch egoistisch nennen. Leider!<br>  Der ganze Stra?enverkehr w?re viel freundlicher, wenn die Leute sich auch mal bedanken und entgegenkommend sind.<br>  Das ist leider nie er Fall, besser gesagt fast nie. Es gibt auch Ausnahmen. Ich lasse auch so viel raus und da kommt nicht mal eine Danke zurück, dann denke ich mir auch immer mein Teil.<br>  Mir gehst dann wie Dir und wenn was kommt, freue ich mich riesig.|`|5fc3a1a2b5d478f840414d4eef440054aa	Je mehr sich so verhalten wie Du es vormachst, desto mehr werden über ihr eigenes Verhalten nachdenken und vor allem, ihre Mitmenschen wieder wahrnehmen.

Das sollte uns aber nicht daran hindern, weiterhin h?flich und freundlich zu bleiben, vielleicht macht das ja manchmal Schule.|`|U2p6gT11aa	Ich habe noch nie einen LKW-Fahrer erlebt, der sich nicht bedankt hat. Nehme mal an, die Leute, die aus beruflichen Gründen auf gutes Miteinander im Stra?enverkehr angewiesen sind, wissen das zu sch?tzen. Die lassen einen auch mal raus.

Ich wei? ja nich, wi oft oder wieviel du f?hrst, wie viel Zeit du auf der Autobahn, etc.verbringst. Ich kann nur von mir sagen, ich freue mich genauso über kleine Aufmerksamkeiten, die ich anderen tun kann, wie auch die, die mir andere tun. Ich finde, dass ein kleiner Wink mit der Hand als dank, schon einiges ausl?sen kann, um dem ganzen Verkehrsdrama ein wenig zufriedener entgegenzusehen. <br>  Hm, im Stau genau das gleiche. Klar...man kommt zu sp?t zur Arbeit, im Urlaub kommt man eine Weile sp?ter an, aber warum sich unn?tig aufregen? Man kann eh nichts daran ?ndern, wenn man einmal drinsteht. Man sollte die ganze Situation etwas lockerer sehen und vielleicht lernt man ja auch im Stau ein paar nette Leute kennen, mit denen man beim quatschen sicherlich die Zeit vergisst und sich die Wartezeit damit ein wenig verkürzt. <br>  Ich sage dass so, weil ich seit nunmehr 5 Jahren fast jede Woche mindestens 2mal im Stau stehe, aber es macht mir nichts aus...?ndern kann ich′s eh nicht und irgendwann komm auch ich zu Hause an... <br>  Ich fahre gern Auto und freu mich über alle, die dem Verkehr, den Staus und den Mitfahrern genauso aufgeschlossen gegenüberstehen wie ich... :-)<br>  <br>  Bis zum n?chsten Stau, Gru?

The ones that did never had them on the driver side after 1968.  Many of these vehicles had the coded lock replaced with one without a code under a recall.  Taking a door lock to a locksmith will only guarantee a working door key as most current door locks lack several tumblers included in the ignition.  The "dealer only" in regard to chip keys is a myth.<br>  <br>  Call a locksmith before your car wanders off with the person who stole your key.

RWjvcCYoaa	Just because a car reaches a certain age and may qualify for classic status with your insurance company and/or DMV, that doesn't make it a classic.<br>  <br>  In order for a vehicle to gain classic status, there has to be something special about it, such as limited production, inspired styling, hard to find or nostalgically desirable at auctions. Not every vehicle qualifies. Car experts can only guess at what may be the next classic to hit the market. Many thought the AMC Pacer would've been by now. It isn't. But who would've thought a 70 Barracuda convertible that sold new for $3,500 would fetch $100,000 today?<br>  <br>  There's no way to accurately predict what will be next to gain classic status. But unless there's something outstandingly special about yoru truck, chances are it won't be anything but an old truck years from now.<br>  |`|ocwetmQuaa	It takes about 30-50 years.<br>  |`|e54245b949fc37ae37c1c0d76403714daa	It could depend on the state whether it would be considered a classic or not.  Usually insurance rates will decrease if the vehicle is registered as a classic or even an antique.  But to do that, there are certain restrictions on where, how many miles, times etc to drive the car/truck.  In NJ 20 years is considered a classic, and can get "classic plates"  25 years in NJ is considered an antique and can get antique plates.  <br>  Check with your state.<br>  I am not sure if this answered your question or not, or whether you are just curious about your truck being a classic, or want to actually plate it as a classic.  |`|HSntlQuXaa	2050|`|2VCYL0F3aa	20 years|`|l5ClLY8qaa	      20 years|`|kvKqvBBDaa	A car becomes eligible to be registered as an antique after 25 years.|`|4tSOSlAdaa	25 years usually.

La vraie "super 5" est sortie en 1973, c'etait une DS modèle D"super5" (D super 5 vitesses), il y a eu aussi les Dsuper, Dspécial, etc...<br>  Trouver un monogramme de Renault 3super 5" est très rare, certains collectionneurs se les arrachent pour plus de 300 Euros !|`|647f5226744c537e599ae277d46926d2aa	moi j'ai eu 3voitures : 3 super5!!<br>  mon rêve, une super5 tout juste sortie de l'usine!<br>  elle est petite et donc pratique à garer ; elle est solide et peut t'amener où tu veux ; le moteur est d'une simplicité qui fait que même moi je peux faire la vidange toute seule!!!!|`|67b3a291ceba06d04dababd351e4267faa	Moi, je préfère Super tout court|`|6ddd59a256d752e33e3324289ab49b1caa	J'ai eu 2 super5<br>  La première une diesel en tant que jeune conducteur, y a pas a dire on peut faire et des bornes et manoeuvrer en centre ville.<br>  la seconde gt turbo ( je roule encore avec), qui donne de bonne sensation de conduire.<br>  <br>  Attention de ne pas débuter avec un gt en jeune conducteur, vous aurez des surprise (voire des accidents avec)|`|9128be9eaeb0563c72368bde28f41a05aa	moi, c'était ma première voiture en 1986, alors automatiquement on s'attache....|`|c51c0637412e9a1fc3eda811689dafd9aa	bien la super 5 facile d'entretien facile pour la mécanique|`|eae2bcb8b4a5b69e5227f29ac11f3eebaa	oui, mais la GT Turbo alors !

Have a friend who has one, its real nice.|`|B4zroZHmaa	Get a lexus is300 
l5ClLY8qaa	I would pick the subaru. For one thing the subaru is more reliable and cheaper to fix when things go wrong with it. You need to also think about the insurance on the car. The Volkswagen cost more for insurance because of the parts to replace on them, specially the electronics. I to am looking for a used Subaru because of the reliability of them. My brother in-law has had 2 in the last 15 years with over 150,000 miles on both of them and gave them to his daughters after that. He has never done anything on them as far as major repairs and he lives in Colorado where there is allot of snow. |`|GLKeyUucaa	Wow, this seems like a great question, as I answer it seems like it's almost tied 50-50 between the two.<br>  I would suggest the Subaru.  It has AWD which can make emergency manuevers easier (a big plus for a novice driver), it is a very safe car, and is pretty reliable.  I am not sure off the top of my head which gets better gas mileage, I know the Subaru's are pretty good considering they have AWD which always takes a toll on ur gas mileage.  I would aslo say that parts and labor would be slightly cheaper on the Subie.<br>  <br>  The only problem is that used Subarus have a very high resale value, making it hard to find one in good condition with decent mileage for a good deal.<br>  <br>  Another suggestion is the 98-01 Impreza 2.5RS.  It comes in both coupe and sedan form, it gets slightly better mileage than the Legacy, it has a very peppy motor, and if im not mistaken has a rollbar built into it, adding to safety, which is 1 of the top priorities for 1st time drivers.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|TbiSBXclaa	Finding either in your price range won't be easy.  A decent Passat will run you at least $8500.  A Legacy might be a bit cheaper.|`|b8MqIU5Vaa	I drive a 2001 Subaru Outback. I know you are looking for a different model Subaru, but I would imagine it would be similar. <br>  <br>  VW's are definitely more popular, but Subaru's do get some pretty decent gas mileage. Subaru's are extremely reliable, mine has never let me down, except when the battery died on me, but it was seven years old, and time for a new one anyway. I drive mine a ton(commute to between college and home at the beginning and end of weekends, pizza delivery girl) and it's still in great shape. |`|AxoXQIZxaa	Go for Subaru mate. Its "all wheel drive" is fantastic and has one of the best traction control. Its "boxer" engine is one of the best since a long time. VW will be expensive to buy and may be expensive to maintain in the future.|`|AY1lQzGTaa	A german car is way better.|`|DKDknInnaa	I hear that Volkswagen have a tendency to roll. So the Subaru is probably safer. I hear the subaru has MUCH better gas mileage.|`|ZXnihkVmaa	Get a Passat dude. Its gives better mileage. Also not that expensive in maintenance.|`|nnZTcVFEaa	V.W. DUDE ALL THE WAY! IM 33 AND ITS ALL ILL DRIVE! SINCE I WAS UR AGE AND ONLY BOUGHT 4! ANSWER UR QUESTION?
UQWusO1waa	no,, they are give nothing ether way.|`|l5ClLY8qaa	If you are going to trade it in, do not fix it. The dealership most of the time will either sell it off to a wholesale broker or they will fix it and keep it on there lot. The dealership will not give you any more for the car if you do fix it, specially during these times. If you pay $1,000.00 to get it fix, they will give you maybe $300.00 more for the car for the trade in price. Go at the end of the month of this year, about 4 hours before they close and you will get a better deal, specially on the 2008 models. The reason for this is because the salesman needs to make his quota for the end of the month, it is Christmas time around the corner, plus they need to unload as many 2008 models before the end of the year. |`|nWU2rOSSaa	I am a salesman at a dodge franchise. When you trade it they are going to give you a value minus what their service department charges to do the repairs. Most times alot more than what you can fix it yourself for. Also dont get too excited about the KBB value. It is a consumer guide and usually about $1500-$2000 different than what a dealer will offer. We base the trade value off of a wholsesale guide called NADA Black book. It tells us the average value we can purchase that model for at a dealer auction. KBB, NADA, and Edmonds are consumer guides ment to give you an idea. You have to have to be a dealer to get the black book. Good Luck
iUHIbU9Zaa	If you have enough money then I would prefer cash.<br>  In case you don't have then go for a loan. Loan will take time to approve and will delay your buy. So take a decision accordingly. But if you need cash for other things right now then I would prefer loan because buying car requires a big amount.|`|hDZQj2kKaa	Car loans are a dime a dozen, but which one should you go for? Especially if you are a prudent consumer with a balanced budget, getting the right auto finance can be quite a challenge, what with so many auto finance providers thrusting their offers in your face. Your dealer may even offer to do it for you. While this sounds really tempting, it may prove to be a costly affair. So do your own thing and check out the auto loans yourself.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://badcreditloans.awardspace.com/" rel="nofollow">http://badcreditloans.awardspace.com/</a><br>  <br>  You can get these loans from a variety of sources, like banks and financial institutions and online financing companies. Dedicated auto finance companies usually offer better terms if you approach them directly rather than through some middleman. You should also keep in mind that your credit rating affects the interest rates and the amount of advance you can easily get, so if the picture is not too good on that front, you can begin by working towards improving your credit rating.|`|l5ClLY8qaa	            CASH|`|4aDvWfpQaa	cash|`|hCKmLScfaa	of course cash, so you won't have any problem in the future and if ever you need something more for the vehicle. And that's really better. Do you mind driving a great car but in credit? I think you can just use credits on extra car parts on parts and accessories like online in racepages.com and some car shops.  |`|9xWV2MhJaa	If I were you I would buy a car because then you would be able to sell it when you are unable to drive or when you want to get a different car. With loaning a car you wont be able to do so.|`|QuYWQWP2aa	price , performance , fuel effency , power and finally style|`|y0NkQUb4aa	cash is way smarter, but not always possible.|`|RWjvcCYoaa	If your credit is good enough to finance at a decent APR, do it! With the credit crisis we're in today, anyone who can finance should. Not only do you strengthen your credit but you can also put just part of your cash down on a car. And put the rest into bonds. But only if you qualify for a good interest rate.<br>  <br>  When we finally get through the recession, you can convert the bonds in CD or other money market accounts. <br>  <br>  The worst thing about paying for a car with cash is that it's just like throwing most of your money out a window. A car is not an investment. It's a liability. It LOSES money all the time you own it. By the time you pay off your loan, your car may be worth just 15% of what you paid for it.<br>  <br>  Since you're going to lose money, protect your losses by offsetting much of the depreciation with a sound investment like bonds. Keep in mind, bonds are still very strong today while the stock market's taken a beating. Don't put all your cash into a car. |`|6gMldg8Aaa	Ca$h. Get it out of tha way quicker I guess.

6HMTlQMaaa	David has a good set of safety considerations.<br>  <br>  Stay low, stay dry, and don't overload.<br>  <br>  Watch the weather. Canoes don't like wind or lightning.<br>  <br>  Have fun and be safe.|`|48eb2dbb79fba479784347026d54127daa	Make sure your motorcycle does not tip over while it's in the canoe.|`|AA11599219	Cold water exposure and drowning are probably the biggest killers on canoe expeditions.   Know the water temperature and air temperature.  Bring clothing such as fleece that will keep you dry when wet.   Wear a properly fitted pfd.<br>  <br>  Lightning/wind - Get off the water and seek cover of trees, but be sure you are not standing in a low wet area or on tree roots that can carry the current.  Also thinking of the exposure of your tent to lighting and falling limbs/trees.<br>  <br>  Serious Cuts - often caused by axes or saws.  I leave them at home and only use firewood I can break by hand.    If you use these, be sure people are careful, away from other people and using good footwear.<br>  Be careful using knives.   I recommend staying away from non locking folding knives.  Half of the cuts I've seen happen when these fold back across people fingers, especially when whittling.<br>  <br>  Illness- filter or otherwise properly treat your water.   Have people wash their hands, wash your plates and occasionally sterilize everything in boiling water.   Bring  proper meds for diarrhea, constipation, upset stomach, allergic reactions, etc.<br>  <br>  Burns - Keep covered, wear sunscreen.  Be very careful with stoves and fires.  Make sure fires are safely out and doused with water before bed or leaving a campsite.   Have good pot grippers.  Don't serve food or hot water off the stove, but set it somewhere more stable.<br>  <br>  Foot/running injuries - Except for easy river trips, don't wear sandals.  Wear shoes or boots that will protect the foot from rocks and sticks.   Wear foot wear all the time.   Don't run and horseplay<br>  <br>  Food - keep it sanitary, hang it above the reach of small rodents at night, but don't climb trees to hang it.  I'm aware of several serious injuries related to people climbing trees.<br>  <br>  Bring a well equippped first aid kit and know basic first aid.  I think it's more  important to know how to treat burns, bleeding, hypothermia, heat stroke, etc than CPR.<br>  <br>  Keep your stuff organized so you don't loose anything important.<br>  <br>  Keep an eye on the time of day and distance to cover so you don't get caught out at night.<br>  Rules that keep people safe and attention to the above common injuries can be very helpful, but in the end, it's important you understand and constantly evaluate potential risks and when you see something act.  I'd be half the accidents that happen on trips, someone saw the potnetial for an accident, but didn't act to prevent it.|`|5GZru9b3aa	never take too much beer ( makes paddling hard)

8ifKojOXaa	 No1 thing is to get the cars brakes checked out by having a free brake check performed by a reliable shop and by getting at least having two shops conduct a free check on the brake system.Plus I'd have a free front end check performed by a reliable shop too.<br>   No2 check the air filter change if needed and change the gas filter plus have a oil change performed on it and if I were you I'd had 25% of Lucas oil treatment to the oil change.<br>   No3 check the belt system for loose or tight belts or belts peeling or fraying apart , plus check while engine is idle at normal idle speeds and at 2000 rpms if the belts jump on any of the pulleys as it idles or is reffed up and if any of the pulleys shafts have too much play or are wobbling.Normally any pulley will perhaps come out a bit as engine is reffed up but not very much, plus there shouldn't be any pulleys wobbling at all and if so then have them checked.Also check to see that all the pulleys don't have any leaks coming from the shafts at the bottom of pulley.<br>   No4 be sure to check the antifreeze level and to check the mixture of the coolant is right via a antifreeze tester.It's good to have a mixture of at least 50/50 but if travelling to hot climates you may want to have 60% water and 40% antifreeze.It really would be a good idea especially if you can change the antifreeze and thermostat yourself to change them before any long trips are made.<br>   No5 check the rad and its hoses and all hoses leading to water pumps , power steering pump and all steel lines you can see under hood or car.<br>   No6 be sure to check for any leaks in the vac lines or other hose systems.<br>   No7 check for proper air pressure pressure in tires and any worn or bad tires , plus have the tires balanced.<br>   No8 it might be a good idea to have a free exhaust check performed <br>   No9 always try to check the oil levels every 250 miles or 400 kms when driving long distances and keep in mind that not always when a gas attentend or service bussiness says you need to add oil is oil really needed to be added.Note that most engines once hot will have at least about a 1/8 or 1/4 or a litre in the engine and no oil is needed really unless you see it may need more then 1/2 litre of oil added then only add a bit no more then 1/4 of a litre to engine and never add cold oil or too cool oil to a hot engine.<br>   No10 always try to use a shop that will allow you to not only see or watch the work but they will show you the cause or fault and explain it to you , at those times its a great idea to go under the car or vehicle and sneak looks at the whole car systems plus it allows you to ask questions or look for possible leaks or obvious faults the vehicle may have first hand too.<br>  <br>   Hope that helps and best of luck.By the way it's a great idea to watch your dash indicators and instrument panel and to watch for the engines temperatures as idle and as it runs for awhile after driving it on hwys or stop and go traffic or when driving for any long periods so you will know the right normal operating temperatures of your engine when its just idling or warmed up and after 2 hrs of driving and what temperatures it reaches when driving over 4 hrs then as it has been driven for 8hrs bec any engine running right with the right coolant and mixture will have certain temperatures they reach at these pints of running times , plus be sure to try and listen to the vehicle's natural driving sounds and reactions or responses as you drive it before you leave on your wonderful trip and while on it too.<br>   one finally note really be careful when you add oils and be sure you add some Lucas bec it will coat the whole engine internally and if you ever drive it low on oil without knowing it then it helps to protect engine too.|`|hah4QjZKaa	Should be no problem. Might want to have it serviced before going. Going to Ft. Bragg?|`|l5ClLY8qaa	I would have the car serviced all around and replace the oil with Synthetic Oil ( Mobil 1 ) for engine protection from friction and over heating and for better gas millage. But once you us Synthetic Oil, you have to stay with it, but it is worth it. It will make your car last longer of wear and tear of engine parts. I would also make sure that you flush the radiator and replace it with anti freeze because today in Calif it was 92 degrees in Anaheim.

gjAZeRyfaa	If they give you $15000. for your charger, then you have $2000. dollars<br>  left over after paying off your charger, to put down on the bmw.  So, if the bmw costs $20000. then you<br>  will owe after the trade $18000. then you can reduce it with<br>  your $5000. cash to $13000.|`|72kaxUvJaa	i wish i could get a 745 or even a charger.|`|825wJSjTaa	It's a bad idea to trade your 2006 Charger for a 2002 745Li no matter how you look at it! Yeah BMW's are luxury and have a ton of options and electronics, but you know what happens to computers and gadgets eventually. They break and are very expensive to replace! Save yourself a headache and don't trade for the car. I like BMW's but don't waste your money on a model which isn't still covered under factory warranty.|`|21b10c813f77db9b13d7cda89f7b63bdaa	I'm looking at the 745li too. I suggest you try selling your charger, getting a loan through a credit union (much lower interest rate), and putting down as much cash as you can on the BMW. Yes, everyone says german cars are expensive to maintain, but that really depends on your personality, and if you want quality.  I work on my Mercedes, it saves money and helps you obtain invaluable knowledge...|`|l5ClLY8qaa	Check with your insurance company on that BMW, because it will be allot more to insure it. It is because of the electronics that are in it that makes it so expensive if you have to replace any of it, if it gets stolen. It is with all German Made Cars.
57Fgjic5aa	there is a reason that they put a salvage title on it. Salvage cars tend to be harder to re-sell and insure|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	Try getting insurance or financing for the salvage and get back to us.|`|AA11914369	It's a wonderful idea to save money by buying a salvage titled vehicle if you're looking for parts.<br>  <br>  If you want something to drive, stay away from salvage titles.  You will have a hard time getting insurance coverage, and no one will give you collision coverage.<br>  <br>  If someone hits you and are at fault, you will only be paid 50% of what you would get because of the salvage title.  Same thing if you go to trade it in on something else.|`|l5ClLY8qaa	It is just the resale value of the car when it comes for you to sell it.Because the tittle being salvage will never change. Also check with your insurance company as well. |`|unsJoK0Raa	You will always have the salvaged title. Better to buy a car without damage history.
l5ClLY8qaa	All German Made cars are expensive when it comes to repairs, but also check with the Insurance Company as well.

I refinanced my car loan and saved a bit. then, my fiance got laid off, i had a dental surgery emergency that went over my healtcare limit. I blew the stupid plastic impellar in the water pump (CHECK THAT) twice, the first time in the cotton fields of mississippi, 300 miles from the nearest BMW part. I had a service company put crap oil in it, which i had to replace off my own wallet. i need to replace the tires (fair.. it's due) I replaced the thermostat because I couldn't believe that the water impeller broke twice in a year... two weeks and three rebuilds later, i sucked it up and added it to the good ol credit card.... i have a growing lists of things i need to fix on it... regardless, tyhe bad news, "just ahead" was not even CLOSE to enough to continue living the way I had prior to the car...<br>  <br>  c) that said, BMW makes the finest machine in the world, through this entire miserable year, and through all of the maintenace.. there is nothing more redeeming than tearing some sh** up in that car. no matter how bad a day i had... nothing compared to the handling, acceleration/etc. (I also love for keeping it dirty, so that the joneses with their shiny BMWs get upset that I'm messing up their etiquette ... i love when punks in accords with loud mufflers or loud subwoofers pull up next to me at a stoplight... i love even more, letting them make an *** out of themselves because I am so confident that I could whoop em' that I don't have to..) <br>  <br>  I eat cheap and live cheap now, but with current economy, I couldn't resell the car for a profit, so I am stuck with it... which I am ok with, because I love the car that much... if you love the car that much, go for it. if not... you'll be happier in the long run buying a better car that you can more easily afford.<br>  <br>  lastly, 53k.... mine was 56k a 2001, the factory coverage and warranties all run out at.... 60k. important to know. learn to fix a bimmer, or plan on spending out the ***. I like learning to fix it, it is more redeeming driving it... your call..<br>  <br>  its a cult, the BMW, and as a cult everything is more specialized, often better, occasionally worse. always harder to find information. <br>  <br>  if it's your kind of car there is nothing better. I plan on keeping mine till i die. and making it faster and tighter the entire way. but i'm a freak.<br>  <br>  your choice, good luck<br>  
z4UvJv1xaa	the Audi does have a few prob's such as the torque converters break down and can cost over 1000then comes all the $$$ for the servicing. I do how ever agree they are a good car but you have to look into the expence of the running costs of the services and other things If you know a good mechanic that will tell you commonly exactly goes wrong with that particular car you will have the inside knowledge|`|l5ClLY8qaa	I think the Audi is way over priced and there are allot better looking cars out there for the money.

44PDDl8Waa	At the moment, the hardest challenge may be acquiring a loan.  However, considering the slowdown, the market is likely very competitive.  As for evaluating your financial situation, you may want to speak with a financial advisor to help you better understand what you can afford.  When you purchase a new car, there are three things to consider: the size of car payment you can afford, the length of time you are financing your car, and car insurance.  Obviously, the type of car you purchase will impact all of these factors.  <br>  <br>  As a representative of State Farm, I want you to know that may be useful for you: <a href="http://www.statefarm.com/newcar." rel="nofollow">http://www.statefarm.com/newcar.</a>  One area you may want to use is the “Find out what vehicles cost the most or least to insure” tool.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  <br>  |`|TbiSBXclaa	If you have an excellent credit rating you won't have any problem finding a lender.  Cars sales are down but that doesn't mean you'll get a great deal on new and popular models.  The brand new mazda6 isn't going to be discounted much. It's fresh and brand new and they don't need to discount them to move them off the lot. same with the Civic SI, it's a very popular model and not hard to sell at all.  I wouldn't even consider the Lancer GTS.  If you want a Lancer buy the EVO or the Ralliart trim.  Great cars. The GTS is a base Lancer with fancy bolt on accessories.  It's all show and no go.<br>  <br>  The Toyota is probably your easiest car to get a deal on.  They make them by the millions, there are probably 200 of them sitting on the lot and Toyota is having a really bad year. That adds up to deep discounts.|`|IGAzs2UEaa	mazda looks very good. but honda would be a beter choice if you may decide to sell it soon.|`|l5ClLY8qaa	Yes it is a good time to buy a car at this time. It gets better when it gets closer to the end of the year. When you do go to look to purchase, go at the end of the month because that is when the sales man needs to make his quota for the end of the month. Also it will also save you allot of money if you buy a 2008 when the 2009 are out on the market, because they have to make the interest charges to the bank for all those 2008's that been sitting on the lot. It is also better that you don't have a trade in, because they will dick you around with the price if you have a trade in. Always let the sales man know that you are very interested in another Mfg. car when you are looking so that he will make the deal happen for you for the price you want. Remember if you buy a 2008 car, it is already a year old and it has already depreciated and he needs to get rid of the 2008's. And don't forget to get the free full tank of gas and the car mats when you make the deal. Oh almost forgot, also go in the evening when you buy, about 4 hours before they close once you have made up your mind on the dealership and the car you want.

2b46e8812e90a91fec1d5dbdec22d19caa	Lucky Lucky You! and a Very Happy birthday in advance...<br>  Basically, it depends on the person, and alot of other things.<br>  if you like to go off-roadin, then jeep is the 4x4 for you.<br>  There's no question about it.<br>  But here's the thing, it also depends on how good of a driver you are.<br>  you did'nt exactly tell me which of the model of the wrangler you were interested in.... wrangler is a powerful offroader, which means 4WD, bigger engine, more cylinders, less economy to the gallon, wranglers are guzzlers, when it comes to gas.<br>  but if you need a car for a the city, and dont' have much activities, like hunting, camping, and offroadin, <br>  then i would prefer you go for the c30, it's small compact, good on mileage, volvo is known for it's safety standards. and looks pretty stylish, can be the envy of your friends. it would be easy on your pockets when it comes to gas, and then again, the parts maybe be a bit expensive, but when you get a car, it's gonna come of course with maintenance and expenses.. just depends on well, you drive your car, and how much you take care of it. If you do that well, and it's gonna be a new car, you won't have much expenses on the car, for the first few years.<br>   And somehow, i think it's gonna be pretty hard for you to change a tyre, on a jeep wrangler when you have a flat!! :)|`|qjtzjC7Vaa	Volvo is one of the safest vehicles if not the safest in the world, the Wrangler due to its high center of gravity, short wheelbase and a lack of any safety features such as stability control, side airbags is one of the worst. Volvo offers all the common safety feature is one of only two manufacturers right now to offer anti whiplash technology build into their seats, the other is Mercedes Benz. Some may say that the Volvo is expensive to repair, ours had zero repairs in the last 3 years except oil changes. There are more Volvos on the road with over 500,000 miles than any other make, when they say that the car lasts an average 17 years they can back that up.|`|l5ClLY8qaa	If you want the car to last long, why would you pick those two vehicles ?  I would have chosen either Subaru or Honda. My brother in law has had 2 Subaru with each one has had over 150,000 miles on them and had never done any heavy repairs other than regular matinees and he lives in Colorado. The Honda is also very reliable and the tract record is about the same as the Subaru but more stylish.|`|xFxIsGr6aa	Stay away, FAR away from the C30. Tis a new model year, and has not had the kinks knocked out of it.<br>  <br>  The Jeep Wrangler is currently a much, MUCH more reliable vehicle.<br>  <br>  (Modern volvos are really kind of shitty... They require a lot of up keep, and that is NOT cheap with them.)<br>  <br>  Guess how much a new headlight for the C30 costs?<br>  <br>  Right around 350$.<br>  <br>  All the parts prices are like that.|`|M23PdLiPaa	Go for the Jeep...they're American, low maintenance, affordable to fix and hardly break down. I ran my Jeep two years without a tune-up and that poor baby never gave out on me. She's a 97' and still kicking like an 08'. I'm a Jeep girl forever now.|`|WpqwaqcQaa	none of the above<br>  <br>  jeep is really bad<br>  <br>  volvo is hit and miss but very expensive to repair.<br>  <br>  of these two the volvo is less bad but they better choices that will last longer.|`|TbiSBXclaa	Volvo Euro style, expensive, safe.

l5ClLY8qaa	I would pick the Toyota, just for the cost of repairs being cheaper and the longer life of the car being new, but I love the looks of the Mercedes<br>  and the Prestige of a luxury car.

RWjvcCYoaa	It's a great deal ... but not on an Isuzu. Other makes area offering just as deep a discount on their SUVs. Any time a car line is discontinued the value of its cars and trucks take a huge depreciation hit. And they continue to take accelerated hits for the next 3 to 4 years. Just as Oldsmobile owners who saw the bottom fall out of the value of their cars.<br>  <br>  You'll still be able to get parts and service on it. But you'll be taking it big time to your wallet.|`|l5ClLY8qaa	Check and see if the Chevy parts are the same as the Isuzu for replacement parts.

I would go with the Rav 4. |`|l5ClLY8qaa	If you are talking about the 2008 and 2009 models, I prefer the Honda CRV over the Rav 4 . Not saying the Rav 4 is not a good auto, which it is.

yDJiiqcsaa	Don't trade in a car - that gives the salesman 2 ways to take advantage of you. Sell your car privately - that way you'll know how much you are really getting. If it's "upside down"  (you owe more on the car than you can sell it for) then you're stuck.  If you get more than you still owe - then you have profit.  Once you have cash - then you can bargain for the new car without the smokescreen of "trade in price" being offset by them giving no discount off the price for the new car.  If the car is "upside down" but it would be more cost efficient to have a newer, more gas efficient less costly car - you can always decide to pay off the difference from what you sell the old one for and the payoff price. Just remember that you can always tell when a salesman is lying to you - his lips are moving.|`|AA10774852	The first question is: what is your present car worth?  (Go to kbb.com or nada.com to find out.)  If it is less than $16,000, the thing is said to be "under water", and you must pay off the difference to the lender if you dispose of the car.  If it is worth more, you are much better off; you can apply the difference toward the down payment on a new car.  In either case, what you pay or get depends on what the dealer or buyer thinks the car is worth -- not what the web site thinks.|`|j1XQDnohaa	It depends on how much the car you want to buy costs. If you trade in your car and get 16000 for it, and by are car that costs the same, your payment will only change by a few dollars a month. However, if you only get 14000 or 15000, you may still have to pay off the rest on the old loan, or you can maybe transfer it to the new loan amount.|`|yeVOz0pbaa	I hope that you see red danger lights flashing on this post.<br>  <br>  If you take a car that you owe 16K on and you try to buy another car, you are going to get screwed!<br>  <br>  This is how the process works:  You take your car to the dealer and he says your car is worth only $10K, or less.  He will then say not to worry because we can just roll the balance into the new note.  He then sells you a car for whatever cost + the remaining $6K.  He will probably try to get you to buy an extended warranty for another several thousand dollars.  You walked in owing $16K  You drive out owing more.  Is this what you want?<br>  <br>  Keep driving what you have until it is paid for. Then drive it some more.  Or, sell the car privately, take out a loan for the difference, buy a clunker and drive it until the loan is paid off.  Either way, you owe the money.|`|l5ClLY8qaa	Find out what the pay off is on the loan that you have now before you negotiate a deal on the new car. And yes if your car is worth more that the other car, the balance can be forward as a down payment on the other car. But you need to call your bank and find out what the pay off is on your old loan first.
tR1X1KBuaa	We bought a car from Auto trader a few years ago.<br>  <br>  Depending on who the seller is, we just called the number, asked all our questions, and the seller sent us a ton of pictures via email.  We decided we liked what we heard and saw, and made an appointment to go see the car and purchase it if we liked it when we got there.<br>  <br>  You would probably have to set up financing ahead of time with your bank or credit union if you dont have that kind of cash, but most banks are willing to give you the preapproved credit so when you get there you can simply write out a personal check, and call the bank, they will then transfer your money for you right away.<br>  <br>  But, it is usually your responsibilty for the shipment or pick up of the vehicle, unless the seller is willing to work with you, or meet you half way.|`|l5ClLY8qaa	  You need to get a loan and pay the seller the full amount.

En soi rien d'anormal donc.<br>  <br>  En revanche si votre batterie se décharge systématiquement, c'est soit qu'elle ne se charge plus (problème avec l'alternateur ou le régulateur), soit qu'il y a une fuite de courant sur le circuit.<br>  <br>  Les deux pannes sont quasiment aussi courantes l'une que l'autre.<br>  <br>  Pour ce qui est de savoir si l'ampérage est suffisant, le mieux est encore de se référer au manuel. A priori une 50 Ah devrait suffire sans problème.|`|1f541f71b736fd7b6933d4a0e57b1fa6aa	salut salami, je crois que 50Ha c'est peu pour un diesel. après plusieurs choses possible il faut contr?lé ton alternateur la tension de la courroie ou si il n'y a pas un consommateur de courant qui te vide la batterie celle-ci à l'arrêt, contr?le les ampoules sous le pare-soleil si tu a un ampli ect.... ceci arrive souvent! bon courage a toi, sinon pour ta batterie elle est garantie|`|3f657d1ad84f9d9116602afed98fcfefaa	bougies de préchauffage mon grand fais toi conduire à norauto  70 euros les 4 ,auchan carrefour etc ...|`|6ddd59a256d752e33e3324289ab49b1caa	Mais lol pour la delco<br>  <br>  Une batterie de diesel c'est plus du 70hA en général.<br>  maintenant l'alternateur peu être en cause. <br>  Petit truc pour vérifier si l'alternateur charge, démarrer la voiture et brancher un voltmètre au borne de la batterie, elle doit afficher au alentour de 14V, si c'est moins de 12V, c'est l'alternateur.|`|3fb727f24e3125c52459b715a422a906aa	si tu veux savoir si c est ton alternateur qui deconne le principe est simple tu demarre ta voiture et tu debranche la batterie      en laissant le moteur touner si elle cale c est l alternateur  sinon je peux pas t aider plus|`|6dd3ae80c189a53adbfbcda1d03f57f4aa	Avant de te lancer dans un changement éventuel d'alternateur.......recherche tous simplement si tu n'as rien de branché en direct et qui te vide lentement ta batterie.<br>  Si c'est réellement l'alternateur, ton voyant de batterie doit rougir un peu, soit au ralenti, soit à plein régime.<br>  Bon courage...|`|904371279bb44dd2e06845b9fa943aadaa	peut etre l'aternateur deffectueux|`|c3ea442d7c83781843d7c22b3ccd4645aa	Salut! <br>  ce probleme est surement du a l'alternateur ou aux bougies! verifie dans ton carnet d'entretien si elles ont etaient changées!<br>  sinon contact un ami car pas besoin d'aller au garagiste pour changer des bougies! en revanche si c'est l'alternateur ou le demareur tu n'auras pas le choix :s ! sur ce bonne chance joyeux noel bizzz
AA11327399	You can't buy a car without a job but you cant get a job without a car...classic catch-22.<br>  <br>  Without a qualified person (probably close relative) to co-sign a loan, you have no realistic chance of being approved for a car loan.<br>  <br>  Get your parents to co-sign.  You should probably bring them or some adult with you anyway.  Buying your first car is intimidating and car dealership prey on that to try to exploit you.<br>  <br>  Check geico.com or any insurance website that offers free insurance quotes.<br>  <br>  Go to a credit union or bank to get pre-approved.  The dealer will mark up the rate if you aren't educated on the interest rate you should be paying.  If they can get lower than your bank, go with the dealer but at least you'll know you got a good rate.|`|ee9072f7d1f4aac6f310cafa43872f6faa	The most important thing to buying a car is to avoid those fancy selling points and markdowns.  You want to get the lowest rate possible on your loan.  Shop around by going to banks and credit unions and get a quote.  You will need someone to co-sign with you since you have no credit history.  Do not buy new, that is wasting money right away.  You can get a slightly older model (2005 or 2006) for less money and still won't have to worry about mechanical problems.  You can get free quotes from insurance companies online or give them a call.  Insurance is the easy part if your history is clean.  Do your research before buying the car you want.  Find out bluebook value on it and go to Edmunds.com and find out what that model sells for.  That way you know if the dealer is trying to screw you.|`|c478f056cb88e6ce86dc4fca2726b493aa	Do you want this problem the rest of your life. Go to college and get a degree. You will be in this mess forever most likely. The number one reason people are in debt is because they spend too much money on a car.  Get an education and you will be able to choose what you want to do.<br>  <br>  -dave

Those things are amazing! My bf regularly pounds the living daylights out of the poor little car and it keeps going and going. The only issues it has are just regular wear items that will wear out on any car! <br>  <br>  They are great. If you get a manual transmission. they have decent power, and can keep up in highway traffic. I was following him once and had to double check my speedometer as it said 90mph! <br>  <br>  He has a convertible and a hatchback (egg :-P). The convertible is the cutest little car! It is awesome for the summer! Only problem is they were only made for a couple years back around 1991!<br>  <br>  Not only do they seem to age well, but they are roomy and comfortable! I am 5'11'', and I can sit in the back seat of the hatchback and not be cramped. My head doesn;t touch the top either. <br>  <br>  They fit into small spots where you couldn't fit most other cars out there. <br>  <br>  As you are buying used, if you have any friends who know about cars, take them with you so you don't get screwed. <br>  <br>  Here's a funny fact: The Metro has never left us stranded. My mom's $50,000 Mercedes was completely immobilized when a rat chewed through the wiring harness....(the car is a computer on wheels). It caused  $1000 worth of damage. <br>  <br>  Oh yeah....Metro parts are also really cheap!<br>  <br>  On top of everything, if taken care of properly and driven sanely, you can get around 50 MPG!!!!<br>  <br>  I think GM should bring back the Metro!
DDYZFcnHaa	Have the clutch fluid bled through... if it still misbehaves, consider having the clutch replaced... it probably just got overheated from use on your trip.|`|AA11546364	Sounds like the clutch master cylender is bypassing internally. It won't leak externally and will get worse with repeated use such as going thru the gears.|`|Smkrqdi7aa	You must have had some air in the clutch system somewhere.  There could have been some water or something contaminating it also.  Flush and Bleed clutch system.  It's a place to start.  Good luck.
w32OBRFAaa	Penso che sia una cosa giusta perchè già a 16 anni si puo acquisire l'esperienza sia nel portare la macchina che nel rispettare i segnali stradali,e quando arriva ai 18 anni il ragazzo ha gia 2 anni di esperienza e,quindi, sarà più preparato quando prenderà la patente.<br>  Poi col foglio rosa ci deve essere un adulto al suo fianco,che lo auiterà a portare la macchina.|`|CrqNcvaGaa	Io non sono assolutamente d'accordo e non mi riferisco solo a una questione di maturità o meno. La proposta consiste nel consentire di prendere il foglio rosa a 16 per esercitarsi con qualcuno che abbia una patente di categoria B da almeno 10 anni.. questo foglio varrebbe 3 anni, in modo che al compimento del 18esimo compleanno si possa già essere in grado di sostenere l'esame di pratica. <br>  La trovo una grandissima stupidaggine per vari motivi: <br>  1) chi guida da anni solitamente assume posture e comportamenti che spesso sono indice di bocciatura durante un esame pratico, e queste, anche se involontariamente, possono essere trasmesse a chi sta iniziando a guidare per la prima volta. queste abitudini sono parecchio difficili da abbandonare, anche con l'aiuto di un istruttore di guida,<br>  2) si possono verificare delle situazioni che necessitano di una spiegazione tecnica, che solo un professionista come l'istruttore di guida è in grado di fornire. queste sono molto importanti perchè quando si capisce l'errore fatto, questo non si fa più.<br>  3) l'imprudenza, l'immaturità della grande maggioranza dei sedicenni, in quanto ancora adolescenti, che spesso non si rendono conto degli eventuali pericoli cui possono andare incontro|`|fx7Z8FGoaa	nel mio caso, a me nn interessa questa cosa; mio padre nn mi permeterrebbe mai di guidare la sua auto fra un anno... la mia macchina è una monovolume media e nn è facilissima da giudare e poi nn ha nemmeno i sensori di parcheggio (costavan 500 euro ecco perchè mio papà nn li ha ordinati) da una macchina a sette posti, li riporterei indietro una smart a 2 posti... cmq penso che questa cosa a 16 anni è molto interessante, infatti a 18 anni ci si arriva più sicuri agli esami e sopratutto quando si fanno le prove cn la macchina cn affianco l'istruttore|`|2291c5d17112f73286393c0c1031e28eaa	io ho 17 anni e non sono d'accordo su questa cosa|`|3f6bb5825b6693cac609bf50e5254225aa	Penso proprio che sia giusto. Io ho cominciato a 16 anni a guidare la macchina ogni tanto con mio padre e sono arrivato all'esame molto più preparato degli altri oltre che più tranquillo. Servirebbe anche a ridurre gli incidenti per via della presenza di meno spratichi.|`|GOXPNXtKaa	io penso sia giustissimo....almeno impari davvero a guidare...cosa ke in tre mesi non è facile....e quando farai l'esame sarai più tranquillo e rilassato....e poi appena sarai patentato significa ke avrai già un paio d'anni di guida alle spalle....!|`|TEeCePlxaa	Secondo me no, non è giusto, ci sarebbero troppe persone che ne approfitterebbero...e poi io odio già quelli che guidano quelle simil-macchinine piccole...|`|ehGdpBRJaa	io sono daccordo almeno si hanno 2 anni per provare a guidare e si arriva all'esame più tranquilli
Tvo2BkAIaa	No os ekivokais ninguno de los dos. Tu tienes más razón. Lo que dice el es cierto pero no es necesario. La norma no lo indica, pero lo que dice él se puede hacer, está permitdo. Es como cuando adelantas en una autopista/autovia: ?Mantienes el intermitente si llevas circulando por ejemplo 1 minuto o 2 por ese carril por el que vas adelantando? No, y sin embargo está permitido pero no es necesario mantenerlo|`|f1d6da709ac8de97f7292e42e75166e5aa	llevas razon.el intermitente se pone cundo te quieres incorporar al carril de fuera para salirte|`|lMEhZFqhaa	si deseas seguir dentro de la rotonda no es necesario que lo indiques con ningún intermitente porque no realizas ninguna maniobra de cambio de carril. En cambio si lo tienes que dar si vas a cambiar de carril o cambiar de dirección y salir de la rotonda. Así que la razón la tienes tú sin lugar a ninguna duda.<br>  Los intermitenetes recuérdale a tu amigo que son para avisar al resto de la circulación que te dispones a realizar un cambio de carril o dirección, Si vas en una rotonda por tú carril, y sin intención de cambiar no es necesario dar ninguno, si le llevas dado puedes dar la sensación de realizar algún cambio y entorpecer al resto de los usuarios de la vía. <br>  Espero que me haya explicado bien. Tengo la teoría bien reciente aún. Un saludo|`|423d63a7b3b4fd76ac86b49d6139ea57aa	Yo poino como tu, no hace falta.. ay que indicar que sales, no que te quedas...<br>  ?Sabes lo peor de todo esto? Que cada uno interpreta el codigo de circulacion a us manera, y de aqui salen algunos accidentes tontos de trafico.<br>  <br>  Beos|`|879e5fcaf13cf4feafbcfc2e90d3f17eaa	Hay que ponerlo cuando giras y se?alar la salida de nuevo.|`|Havuvv9kaa	No es necesario poner el intermitente izquierdo para indicar que vas a seguir girando en la rotonda, ya que no existe un cambio de carril, tú sigues girando por el tuyo. Ahora bien, aunque no sea necesario está bien hacerlo para avisar al resto de los conductores de tus intenciones y así evitar que alguno que quiera salir desde el carril izquiero se te atraviese en tu camino (el culpable del accidente sería el contrario, pero si podemos evitar el choque, mejor ?no?).<br>  <br>  Sólo es necesario indicar con el intermitente derecho la salida de la rotonda.|`|seKoBPmdaa	segun la normativa tu tendrias razón, ya que en una rotonda hay utilizar el intermitente cuando se va a salir de ella.<br>  <br>  Lo que dice tu amigo no es obligatorio pero si recomendable para ayudar en la medida de lo posible al resto de conductores y para que éstos puedan entrar en la rotonda teniendo en cuenta que llevas el intermitente izquierdo puesto con lo que indicas que vas a seguir en ella.<br>  <br>  <br>  saludos.|`|7f6e3749451abbff6d8b6ee6b4caf977aa	pienso que ninguno de los dos esta equivocado y que los dos llevais la razon a medias...me explico.<br>  <br>  tu tienes razon porque se debe poner el intermitente para salir de la rotonda si se va circulando por dentro asi se?alizareis la maniobra con tiempo...<br>  <br>  pero tu amigo no esta del todo equivocado, porque aunque no es obligatorio(como en el caso de se?alizar la salida), tampoco seria un error el poner el intermitente para ayudar el resto de los conductores a que sepan que intenciones se tiene de seguir circulando dentro de la rotonda.<br>  <br>  sin mas, creo que tu amigo es bastante precavido y la verdad es que en las rotondas cualquier precaucion es poca...<br>  <br>  *un saludo|`|U4qGDpcMaa	solo se tiene que poner el intermitente al entrar o al salir de una rotonda|`|qVnqrsiqaa	nose
