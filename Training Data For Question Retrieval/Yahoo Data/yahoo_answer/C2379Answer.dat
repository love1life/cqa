ZaSiPFvtaa	Arkansas will make you shell out a lot of money, and burn a lot of time -- but other states (most of them) are even worse, in both respects.  You can google "Arkansas Department of Education" and follow the appropriate links for more information.|`|VrwM9Oiiaa	You should contact your Department of Education, they must have some kind of program for people like you. In Texas (like someone mentioned before me) we have a so-called Alternative Certification Program. Yes, you will have to study for 1 year and then take a state exam. But the best part is you can find a job and while you're working (they'll give you a temporary certificate), you can go to school (evenings, twice a week), and you'll have your salary to pay for it (smth about $3K or so).|`|bC0KRacHaa	Texas is pretty easy.  We have an alternative certification program here where if you already have any bachelor's degree, you just do some courses, some of them are entirely online, which is over the course of a few months only, you take content exams, and then it gives you a certification to teach on probation for a year.  During that year, your principal has to approve of you, and you take your PPR (pedagogy) exam.  Then if everything goes well, you get your full certification after your first year of teaching.  Good luck!
1khVEE6oaa	SET UP:  Drawing a picture helps.  So I drew a triangle and labeled its points A, B, and C.  ACB= 70, so a wrote that in at point C for that angle.  ABC= 65 , so I wrote that in at point B for that angle.  Because the sums of the interior angles of a triangle always add to 180 degrees, I know the last angle, at point A, must be 45 degrees by subtraction.    EXPLANATION:  You can figure out the relative lengths of the sides of the triangle that are opposite of each angle easily.  A larger angle will be opposite a longer side, so because ACB is the largest, then AB is the longest side of the triangle.  ABC is the next largest, so AC is the second longest side.  That leaves BC as the shortest side because it is across from the smallest angle.    ANSWER: (3) BC|`|ZapwShp7aa	im pretty sure the answer is C: BC  because when you find the last angle, which is 45, the rule in any triangle, is opposite the smallest angle is the smallest side, and then same thing for the medium and largest angle.|`|BRiRoV1raa	okay. so you have three points-- one for A, one for B, and one for C. they're in some sort of triangular shape. [it usually helps to draw out a diagram of the situation.] you can then mark each degree measure on the corresponding angles-- angle C has a measure of 70 degrees and angle B has a measure of 65 degrees. Because you know that there are 180 degrees in a triangle, the measure of angle A must be 45 degrees. If you draw your picture roughly to scale you should be able to estimate the answer-- which would be (3).    hope this helped. =)
n3q7PZJCaa	firstly, yes. a 3.6 is a very good gpa. i go to a university, youd be surprised how many schools dont look at extra curriculars AT ALL. i applied to 5 schools last year, NONE OF WHICH even gave a spot on the application to put extra curriculars. i felt like it was a waste of my worries and time.  it really is all about SAT's and GPA.  secondly, do you know what college in particular?|`|BhFeii5Xaa	That totally depends on the school and their requirements. Do be sure to take the ACT and SAT testing. Most schools require one or the other for entrance exam.    Try to be a very well rounded student. Have some music and some community service projects in your background.    Apply for as many scholarships as you can! and start them well before you are a last semester Senior. If you are a senior you should have already applied to the Schools of your choice and be waiting for replies.    Land Grant Universities take everyone from 2.0 upwards.|`|bd59614cc680d1d3d5ab4c6e106bc770aa	it depends on what school you want to go to. a 3.6 would probably meet the requirements for a lot of public, and some private schools. keep in mind, though, that GPA isn't the only factor that schools consider. they also like to see high test scores (ACT/SAT) and that you were involved with your high school/community. good luck!|`|vXAfJDzOaa	Depending on which University you hope to attend. A 3.6 is pretty good overall. Most colleges will accept you based on your SAT more than high school GPA. And extra curriculars are always nice. You really shouldn't have any problem getting into the school of your choice, unless that happens to be Harvard. Then you'll just have to write a brilliant entrance essay.    Good luck!

nc8hoTp6aa	a:c  a:b  4a:4b = a:b    therefore, a:b, and 4a: 4b are the same    hope this helps!|`|YWA8w7Ndaa	4a:4b is proportionate. Regardless of their value they are multiplied by the same number...meaning the sum has to be a factor of 4. If they have the same factors they have to be proportionate.|`|meK1OKVvaa	a, b, and c are variables. assume that all a's are the same number, all b's are the same number, and all c's are the same number. a:b is proportional to 4a:4b because if you simplify 4a:4b you get a:b.    To prove it, assume a = 1 and b = 2. your fraction would be 1:2. 4a:4b would be 4(1):4(2) = 4:8, which simplifies to 1:2.    4/4 is the fraction of 1. Ratios are fractions, and the colon (:) means the same thing as the (/) in a fraction. Multiplying anything by 1 doesn't change what it is originally. That is why 4a:4b is proportional to a:b.|`|NMueDtoYaa	4a:4c|`|fMTWLoq1aa	it is 4a:4b beacuse you  have two numbers to compare togahther|`|8idLIc84aa	a:b is proportional to 4a:4b.

The length is 1m more than the width so that could be seen as y = x + 1.    Your equation would be 2x + 2y = 26. Replace the y in this equation with the relation of y = x + 1.    2x+2(x+1)=26  2x+2x+2=26  4x+2-2=26-2  4x=24  Divide by 4 on both sides, x = 6.

XSu3dedGaa	There's no such thing as an easy a-level, that's the point of the UMS marking scheme, it levels everything out so everyone is on the same par.    Ignore people who tell you you've taken easy a-levels, its your choice and your life and your later career, do what makes you happy, not what makes others happy.|`|ToztjpAsaa	First, I'd better declare an interest: I have a science background (I have a doctorate in chemistry).    In my opinion, science A levels are harder than A levels in the arts and humanities.  My son is doing his A levels at the moment (science again) and I think he would back me up.  That's not to say that students who choose history, English literature or some other academic arts/humanities subject are stupid - far from it.  Science is just more difficult to understand.    I think the key difference is that everyone can have an opinion about Chaucer or Shakespeare, but you have to really understand the subject to make sense of science.  This is clear from the way that science is misreported in the media by journalists who are (mainly) arts graduates.    But don't worry.  The world still needs writers!|`|7syjNjwhaa	Oh, I remember reading this. I just think that yes, humanities may be easier subjects then sciences and maths but there is also a demand for careers in art or music and language related stuff. In my case it's a bit controversial because I am good at art, science and languages. But there is a problem of that writers, musician, artists are not as 'useful' in the practical sense, they don't play as much needed part in contributing to society. Well, that's what any working class person might say and it is understandable from their point of view. So I think that these people are playing on the fact that too many students turn to 'easy' ways to make money later on in their life by doing less 'useful' things. They're jealous.

AA11043457	You need to do with with your studies in high school.  Then you would go to college.  The first 2 years are basically general studies with some teaching classes.  The last 2 years are more teaching specific and also your subject matter.  Some programs might require 5 years. <br>  <br>  Once you finish college (and that is in a teaching program),  then  you can look for a job.  However, you need to plan on continuing your education as many states require you to have a masters' degree within 5 or 6 years.  It does not require a doctorate degree.  The masters' degree should also get you an increase in pay and there may be one before that as you get a certain number of hours in.  There may be yearly increases as well.  Some schools offer tuition reimbursement for part of your education.  They also have continuing education classes.  <br>  <br>  You would need to contact a college that you believe you would like to attend and ask about a teaching program and they will tell you the classes you must have.

If you aren't sure which one, the first step would be to find out if they offer a program with a secondary education degree with the proper endorsements to teach those classes.

(You can also reduce 6/10 to 3/5)<br>  <br>  Notice that there is no decimal point in the fraction's 6, because the denominator takes care of that. <br>  <br>  In the same way, 0.37 is read as "thirty-seven hundredths" so it can be written as 37/100. (This cannot be reduced any further.)<br>  <br>  <br>  You can always tel the denominator of a decimal by counting out the place value of its last digit. So 0.2309 is 2309 ten thousandths, because the last digit (9) falls in the "ten thousandths" column. Therefore, this can also be written as 2309/10 000.<br>  ___________________________________<br>  Percents are also fractions, but their denominators are ALWAYS 100.<br>  <br>  So 5% means "five hundredths" which can be written as 5/100 (and also as 0.05, which is also "five hundredths.")<br>  <br>  37% means "thirty-seven hundredths" which is the same as 37/100.

It's just mostly practice once you get the concept down.    y=x+4    y=3x    The problem you have right now is that both equation include two variables.  So you can only solve for x in terms of y and y in terms of x.     How to do change that? By changing the equation without unbalancing it.  You know that y is equal to (x + 4) and that y is equal to 3x.  Therefore, (x + 4) is equal to 3x.    y=x+4  3x=x+4    It's the same equation, you're just substituting in something that you can work with.  You can ONLY put in something it is equal to what you took out the equation must remain balanced, but remember you can ALWAYS put something in that is equal to what you take out.    So, let's now solve for x.    3x = x+4    -x    -x  2x = 4   x = 2    Now you know what x is, so plug that into either one of the equations.    y = x + 4  y = 2 + 4  y = 6    Let's double check that by plugging in x to the other equation and seeing if we get the same result:    y=3x  y=3(2)  y=6    Now, we could do this exact same thing from the beginning, only instead of substituting y, we could do it for x.  If was easier to do y, since we already had two equations with y alone on one side but let's try it the other way.    y = x+4  -4        -4  y - 4 = x    Now we've isolate the x, so let's plug it into the other equation:    y= 3 (x)  y= 3 (y-4)  y= 3 y - 12  + 12   + 12  y + 12 = 3y  -y          -y  12 = 2y  6 = y    Same result, see?  Now we'd plug y into the equation and solve for x, but we've already done that.        Now, just apply this same principle to the other two equations you have to do.  Both of them have already isolated one of your variables for you so it's simply a matter of plugging them in.|`|kRlCuvPwaa	1.     since y=3x then  3x=x+4 -> 2x=4-> x=2  2.   since y=2x-5 then 2x-5=3x-10 -> 5=x  3. since x=y-5 then y-5=-2y+1 -> 3y=6 -> y=2    substitute the 2nd equation for it's letter in the first

lNtwpzpOaa	The first person to baptize was John the Baptist, called the Baptist for his work.     Jesus was baptized for 1.) an example to all men and, 2.) to show his divinity to those present. When Jesus was baptized, the clouds parted and God spoke that this is his Son.     Unfortunately, not all Christians believe in baptism. There are some who believe baptism is considered a work and thus they say it's against God as we're not supposed to work for our salvation. Of course, this completely ignores all the passages that state we must be baptized.     Catholics believe in baptism for numerous reasons:    1.) The forgiveness of sins.  2.) Christ says that unless we are born of both water and spirit we cannot enter into Heaven.  3.) Baptism allows us to receive God's grace and thus starts our journey towards Heaven.|`|2uiuOpSvaa	I gave up Catholicism a long time ago, but I don't think the answers have changed:    (1) John the Baptist was the first person to baptize.

(3) For catholics, the purpose of baptism is to celebrate and acknowledge the embrace of God and god's love.|`|OoihsiN0aa	Christians believe in baptism because it signifies salvation, cleanses away sins, and publicly announces ones faith.

Her parents finally hired a woman by the name of  Annie Sullivan, who was a teacher, and this lady found a way to communicate with Helen, and that was through tapping into Helen's hands.  She was taught the alphabet, how to read braille and how to communicate back to the teacher through tappings on the hand.  Helen became a totally different person, and Annie Sullivan lived with her the rest of her life.|`|hNa5oHxQaa	She was both deaf and blind.|`|A8k9NHigaa	She was blind and deaf. Back then there were not as many accomidations for the impaired as there are now, hence the reason her family hired a full time teacher, Anne Sullivan, to teach her how to live with her handicaps.|`|AA11828439	She was, in fact, deaf, dumb and blind.|`|PnlgLBcwaa	what class is this for?  This is an intersting question.      the book is easy top read--there are even children's versions that are quick reads--    or you can rent one of many DVDs-    its also a simple google search--(How did I get through college without the internet to have other people do my research for me!)      The biggest accommodation was having her teacher with her to interpret    she was not norn deafblind-but became ill at 19 months    she was not dumb    she did learn to speak|`|pDvlQQkcaa	She was deaf and blind. Because what existed of the public school system back in that era did not admit people with disabilities, the Kellers (who were rich) hired a private tutor.      In addition to the '3 r's, the tutor taught Helen disability politics of the day. Hellen had to learn to adapt to society--rather than expecting accommodations in society.    This and again her family wealth (and the connections it brought) ennabled her to earn a college degree. She was a 'wonder' as opposed to a 'sick invalid', But she was not regarded as a citizen.

You can access a review of both these online institutions at http://www.onlineedublog.com/online-degr...  which would make it easier for you to decide whether enrolling at either of these institutions is meant for you or not :)    Hope it helps!!!
IsQckOXraa	yes school is always boring and half the stuff i will never use unless i'm going to do that as a career.... like calculus, i hate that.  :P|`|WixVIsFtaa	yesss. but i think everyone who attends school, thinks its boring to an extent.|`|doSdEtqYaa	School is actually not boring but the examinations are!!!|`|550RTWUOaa	yes.   i could barely keep my eyes open.   unless theres a hottie in the room! lol|`|oR9ZODGtaa	Very.  Unless the teacher is young and fun.|`|R5MW3BSsaa	Yes! Half of the stuff I don't even need, but yet its mandotory! like Chemistry and Geometry! I hate Chemistry!|`|9b6e3856ff9fd505bdf5544026fe01dfaa	very much
7e730f6436a4fbf1ea59232ed326b671aa	Glad to see my taxes at work.  You're welcome.|`|RQ9xB0i8aa	Well, it's boring because you don't have an interest in the subjects you are learning. Like for me, I don't like Math at all, and Math tends to be the most boring time of the day for me.|`|CEhO6PJSaa	cos they teach crap!  duh|`|vkeuaEHiaa	I beg to differ. School is fun if the people in your classes or the teachers are entertaining. So I would guess that your school is boring because nobody livens it up. Make your school a fun place! :)|`|AA11114814	I don't know but I use to think the way you did.  When your young it's easy to dismiss school because you don't realize how important it is until you get to be an adult.  I was like you and it effected me at school.  I wish now I had taken it seriously.  There is so much out there for you if you get a good education and it leads to a good job.  Then you would have money so you can do things you like to do, otherwise you'll be doing boring jobs which is far worse than school|`|z0asv3Jmaa	because you will grow up to be another tax burden for those of us that appreciate our education.|`|Lw37y3J7aa	Without knowing more about you, it could be because you are too intelligent for your classes, and they are not challenging enough for you, so therefore you are bored.|`|39if5WnPaa	Because school is not for you only people that like school and like to learn don't think is boring you have to have an interest in something to like it.
3258fd9ca0baa8e13a1a5449e7bdca00aa	Being nice is doing good things.  Being humble is being unconcerned about whether you get any recognition for doing them.|`|TDjlNgrGaa	being nice usually needs an action. Being humble is more abstract and has more to do with ur own internal feelings.<br>  <br>  interesting question though. I never thought about those two until now|`|bwpU9G2Taa	Being "nice" is just being kind, polite, or sincere; it's actually rather self-explanatory, if you ask me.<br>  <br>  "Humble," on the other hand, is doing acts of kindness secretly, and not boasting about it.<br>  Like if you were to make a rather large donation just to be noticed and have everyone give you praise, then that isn't humble; it's quite the opposite: you're just showing off.<br>  If you were to do that in secret, than that would be humble.<br>  In other words, humble, to me, is being good just for the sake of being good without having others recognize you for it; you expect nothing in return.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	Being nice is the easy  part but true humility isn't telling anyone of your kindness you keep it to yourself this is being humble
d7936494ec9fd5130797ddf028c222bcaa	No. You are missing out part of a word. The apostrophe replaces it.<br>  <br>  You wouldn't write "youve". If you read that you'd be confused. The apostrophe just makes things clearer, like all punctuation.<br>  <br>  Why would you want to WRITE y'all anyway?!|`|4Wull7b2aa	well you dont have to, but to be grammatically correct, you have to use the apostrophe, because its an abreviation. but no ones forcing you to do it anyways.
S7HMWOzwaa	None.
zhJOZhKEaa	I agree with the other answers... it depends on your state law.  You can hunt down that info here: http://www.hslda.org/laws/default.asp      I know that here in Arkansas we just had this 'fixed' a year or two ago... up until that point parents technically had to be the instructors for the majority of the student's work.  Then the law was reworded a bit... now we just have to arrange for the instruction... much more flexablity.  :)|`|LsAArkUyaa	In GA you would be considered a full time tutor. Under GA law a homeschool tutor does not need to be certification or have a degree.|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	I don't know what requirements your state has but I believe it is possible.  A lady at my church is currently homeschooling about 30 students (and has a waiting list).  So it's possible but it may require certain paperwork or certification.  Check with your state.|`|dCewrtXaaa	If you are a credentialed teacher you can almost certainly do it. But you will have to have your business license, liability insurance, and the approval of the school board. You will also have to make sure that your zoning permits running a business from your home, and you will have to file taxes as a business, including estimated quarterly tax, your own Social Security tax, and possibly alternative minimum tax if you file a joint return with your husband. Consult with a tax professional before starting. You will basically be going into business for yourself. This is not the case if you just homeschool your own child.|`|Qxh1kPLfaa	Since you are certified, you probably can teach the child.  You would need to look up the laws of your state.  Some states will consider this homeschooling while another state will consider it tutoring.  You want to have all your paperwork the way the state wants it.
sGRZxLfYaa	Generally speaking girls are more mature and ready.  Boys tend to mature a bit more slowly.  There are exceptions.  I have several nieces who started as the youngest in their classes and did quite well.    My personal experience is my oldest son.  I home schooled him from K - 6th grade.  I thought that I would go ahead and start him since I was teaching him at home.  The problem was that I put him in that grade in his Sunday School class at church.  He was always one of the more immature ones socially and emotionally.  By the time it became a recognizable problem he had good friends in his classes at church and in our home school co-op and it would have been hard for him to be "demoted".    We worked through all of our issues and by the time we enrolled him in a private Christian school in the 7th grade these things had all been resolved.    I don't think it is seen as being held back if you don't start them for another year.  I think that the idea of being held back applies more to the children who begin and can't cut it and so are asked to wait to move on (fail and repeat a grade).  By then there is a stigma because peers move on and they do not.      Cut-off dates are starting points but parents must be the ones to determine their child's readiness.    Blessings!|`|YFTZM86maa	From my limited experience as a school employee and from hearing parents speak of their experiences, all the families who decided to wait have never regretted it.  I personally see no need for 4 or 5 year olds to be in school unless they are already showing that they have some learning, cognitive, or physical disabilities.   The classes I see are huge and I don't think any one child is getting what they need or deserve, but could get at home with good, educated parenting.    As a parent, I hope that you continue sorting this out as a best or worst option for your child and not for you.  Consider class size, how many teachers and how many aides are in the room.  Consider as well if this is half day or whole day or whole day every other day etc.  You know your child best.  How is your child going to handle this change?    Please do not wonder if others are going to pick on your child because he or she will be older than others in the room, or that they may carry the stigma of being "held back".  You can find a positive way to address this IF it comes up.  I remember the good old days when you had to be 6 by a certain date to enter kindergarten.  I also remember those days made up of far more respectful students who handled peer pressure and school pressure better than grade schools I see now.  School is a lot of pressure and stress for kids.  It must be worse when they are younger and unable to even fully understand why they are sent away to school and have no skills to deal with what is going on.  Good luck with your debate.
cMZEmpp0aa	Because it's easier for people to cling to stereotypes and only pay attention to the examples that support the stereotypes/their own personal biases than it is for them to actually learn the truth about the situation. Also, society tells them that you MUST go to school to socialize properly, so therefore if you're not going to school you must not be socializing at all because you're not getting the social experience of school (and experience of questionable value, in my opinion).|`|i4QYyUsRaa	It's just the liberal, union loving, government control crowd attacking home schooling. In most cases the home schooled kids have active social lives. This fallacy about the ":enrichment" of diversity, etc. is more often a serious detriment and exposes children to drugs, crime early sexual activity and horrible language. Granted, some so called home schoolers are a sham and the kids are not learning, but most do much better than the kids In public schools.|`|mC4mnvGFaa	what is wrong is that its not regulated most places. you don't have to teach your kids any more than the basics.No science, history or world affairs. but the bible is taught extensively  The practice produces ignorant bigots who will never be able to get a university degree.  If you haven't got a university degree, how can you possibly teach your kids enough so they can get even a high school diploma?|`|LsAArkUyaa	I asked this a few weeks ago and basically got the answer that not all homeschoolers are as active as my kids. The point those who answered missed was that my kids were doing those activities with hundreds of other homeschoolers.    We are not christian and are members of a huge non christian homeschool group. We are also members of a few secular groups which have many Christian homeschoolers who do not homeschool for religious reasons.  Once again the "homeschoolers are fundamental christians that only teach the bible" stereotype is completely false.  When I posted this question I linked to an article on homeschooling. One of the statistics was that 70% of homeschoolers homeschool for nonreligious reasons.|`|Qxh1kPLfaa	People are hung up on the "social" issue because they cannot think out of their government issued generic box.      They hear the word "home" and improperly assume that home is the only place a homeschooler goes to learn.  Maybe I need to petition to change the name to unboxed education... or how about free range learners??       I too can quote our list of activities but am only greeted back by blank stares.  They cannot get off the 8-4 schedule.  They do not get it that we do more in 4 hours then the boxed educators do in an 8-4 day.      Not too long ago a family member got all ruffled because I was letting my youngest play an educational game rather than an age appropriate worksheet.  They were all worried that his education was going to be deficient.  I looked at them and said "he is a 5 y/o on level 3 of a multiplication game!  Exactly what is he lacking!?"      Lets face it - boxed in minds are only going to see inside of their box.  The only social interaction they know is age segregated groups of 30 where no one is allowed to show leadership qualities.  They cannot possibly understand the complexities of real social interaction as experience by an "out of the box" learner.|`|h4AhS74kaa	I'm 14, and I'm homeschooled. And it's not the parents that care about social life, it's the kids. The parents want the kids to be homeschooled to get away from school dangers, such as shootings. But for the kids, not all kids have brothers or sisters that they can play with, and at school they get to talk to friends. Every kid needs a friend to vibe and vent to. Just think when you was a kid, you always wanted to go to a sleepover with your other girlfriends. I'm not to worried about friends, most of them can ruin something or backstab you so you won't trust no one. Hope this helped.|`|A5gFjKLcaa	i don't really think its the socialization aspect of home schooling. most people are just judgemental about things they don't understand. it is different because you don't get the same experiences as you would if you went to public school like the homecoming dance or spirit week or you and your friends going to the teacher vs. student basketball fundraiser. things like mean teachers and they funny gym teacher who always wears two different shoes. wierd esxperiences liek that. i think missing out on those things is what people see when they think of home schooling.|`|MLGT3rvZaa	I more then agree! I was homeschooled (as were my older sister, and now my younger sister), and I loved every minute of it. The stereotype acting like homeschoolers are SOO unsocial. That's simply untrue. Lord, I had many friends, knew many people, was in many activities, and volunteered on top of that. Heck, I had more "friends" then some of the people I know that attended a public school. Anyone who believes that stereotype apparently doesn't know very much. I graduated two years early with more then enough credits (I took as many high school courses as I could in high school from Computer Science to AP Psychology to AP Latin Literature, etc.).  Every university my sister (who's a couple years older then me) and I applied to we got in! We both even got early admission to the college of our choice.|`|nxjs5QoTaa	u geez im homescholled and umm.... well.... NOT EVERY1 HAS PARENTS LIKE U!!!!!!!! and it is harder to get a girlfriend|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	People who don't understand or agree with something look for negative things to say about it.  They look for ways to criticize it.  And since they can't come up with any valid reasons to be against homeschooling, they've found a way to criticize it, claiming that children who are homeschooled aren't socialized.  Well, they're wrong.  And it's time that somebody let them know.  Good job with your kids--thanks for setting such a great example.
AA11186610	No way. they will never look at your mocks.    However mocks are useful to see how much revision you will need to do for the real thing. I would advise at least revise for one subject as though it was for a real exam so you can gauge how much revision you need to do to get the results you want.|`|7deb425958c53615415ce326bcbf08e0aa	No employers don't look at your mocks.    Mocks are just that, a practice of a GCSE paper under exam conditions. So what if you have two in a day, that can happen with the real thing.    Mocks have two purposes    1) they let you see what GCSE is like  2) they give your teacher an idea whether you should be entered for that GCSE|`|AA11220909	Yes they will look at your mock results if you are applying for a job before the actual results are released in August.|`|jI85GYGoaa	I presume the idea behind it is to provide themselves with some idea of your attainment under more realistic conditions that include how you react under the stress of the actual exam process itself.    Also serves as experience for you to show you have the ability to think independently in response to unexpected demands.    You will be unable to solve the majority of problems you will meet in your later working life by throwing 'coursework' at it.    Best Wishes|`|kJ4g1vujaa	In 18 years since i did my exams i have never been asked to prove my results, let alone the mocks.|`|hktbfRPWaa	No. Never. In most cases the school never had my mocks, we used them to revise from so unless I handed them to the employer they'd never be able to get them
3258fd9ca0baa8e13a1a5449e7bdca00aa	It sounds like your boss is looking into making some kind of investment.  "Exit strategy" in his case would refer to having a plan to get out of the investment in case it doesn't work out, to keep from losing ALL the money he put into it.<br>  <br>  In general, having an exit strategy means that you have an answer for the question, "If it turns out that I can't get what I want out of this situation, how do I get out with the least possible harm to myself?"  That could apply to anything from a schoolyard fight, to robbing a bank, to starting a war.  Hope that helps!
1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	The average IQ is 100.  While half the US population will be below 100, you won't find very many people at all on yahoo won't don't claim to have an IQ of 115 or above (top 15% of the population) and many will claim an IQ over 130 (2 people in 1000).  Since we probably don't have the top 10% of the nation or better as the only contributors to yahoo, it's safe to say that the majority of people will be quoting internet IQ scores, which give everyone scores of above average or much, much better.    So what's mine?  I don't know, I've only taken internet IQ tests.  But based on my education level (PhD student) I think it's safe to assume I am actually above 100.|`|AA11222724	Yes mine is according to mensa when i sat the initial test was 155 top 1 percent.

50WCN0graa	Can you try and find a way to get to know some people before you attend? Do you have any friends of friends who go to the school you will be attending? If not, I would suggest getting to know some people by joining a club or a youth group in the area... if you have someone to "show you the ropes," it should be easier.     Try not to let too many people know you are bummed about the transition or they may think " you look down on them." I would try and find one or two trusted friends to confide in about that stuff.    As far as academically, ask for help when you need it. If your school has a counselor, which is probably does, they are there to help you with whatever you need. You should be able to go them for help picking classes, finding a club to join, trouble with a particular teacher, meeting friends, etc. High school counselors are busy, though, so they probably won't know you need help unless you seek them out and ask for it.    I am not sure what the school you are going to is like or the one you came from is like, but, often times, public and private schools aren't so different as you may think. Best wishes to you!|`|EncopDCmaa	Its pretty much the same as private, no worries...    1.Dress nice    2.Talk to EVERYONE on the first day    3.Be yourself  :]|`|A5gFjKLcaa	public school is not bad at all trust me i attend one.  its not the best one in the state but its like home to me now.  you shouldnt have to change anything about yourself.  there are hundreds of people at public schools there is definitely goign to be someone that you can relate to. just be careful with what you say liek any school there are cliques and their are the girls that have bad reps and guys that have a certain reputation but chances are you will find somewhere t fit in. i wouldnt worry to much about it. public school is the same as private school just without uniforms
BNAzjSO1aa	Well best friends are the ones who are always there for you, they care about you and will help you in any way that they can. The best way to make best friends/good friends is to be like that yourself care how you friends feel don't do anything that would hurt or upset them be there if they need to talk to you and try to help them in anyway you can.|`|8NqQvOqQaa	well your real friends will be the ones that stick by you  no matter what   find out what people that is  and then keep them close.|`|6qsocyK3aa	Tell everyone you think your mum/dad might be losing their jobs and they won't be able to buy you the nice stuff they usually buy you.

Helen Keller was blind and deaf and learned to use sign language by spelling words using touch on the palm of her hand. It was brutal, watching the movie, The Miracle Worker, which is the story told from her teacher's point of view. I think the part of Helen was played by Patty Duke when she was barely in her teens. I remember one scene, with a well pump and her teacher holds her hand in the water and then spells W A T E R, over and over, and then does the same with other things. Like I said, brutal. Very emotional when the character of Helen realizes what it MEANS when W A T E R is spelled out on the palm of her hand. Great acting there.

ktOqm7cgaa	CONTEXT:<br>  To understand the quotation, it is necessary to know the source; and as noted below, the behavior of the source was not always consonant with the quotation's meaning.<br>  <br>  The quotation is attributed to Mildred Babe Didrikson Zaharias (1914-1956), one of America's greatest woman athletes in basketball, baseball, track and field, and golf.  She won 2 gold medals at the 1932 Olympics; and she won the Women's U.S. Open Golf Tournament 3 times.  The Associated Press voted her the Greatest Female Athlete of the first half of the 20th century.  <br>  <br>  MEANING:<br>  The quotation: "Winning has always meant much to me, but winning friends has meant the most" is attributed to her; however, it did not always reflect her attitude.  <br>  <br>  On its face, the quotation reflects a view of fair play and priorities:  She was a fierce competitor and wanted to win; but the quotation would lead one to believe that she valued friendship more than she valued winning; that she enjoyed victory in competition, but preferred winning friends to winning races and tournaments.<br>  <br>  She may have meant it when she said it; however, it must be noted that she excelled in competition; and she often alienated teammates and competitors with her extraordinary skill and drive to win. Her athletic successes were said to have made her arrogant. She was flamboyant and sought attention.  To be fair, as she matured, it is said that she became less self-centered.|`|I6UWH5laaa	it means that winning things like awards or trophies and stuff is valuable to the person, but the person's priority or most valuable thing is to gain friends

AA10176626	Daniele:<br>  <br>  It's not clear from your question whether you're talking about aid for the current semester, or for a future semester. <br>  <br>  Generally speaking, schools do not receive an aid disbursement until the first week of school, or sometimes later, and they won't begin the refund process until the drop/add period has been completed. <br>  <br>  So many students make changes to their schedules during the drop/add window that it would cause nothing but headaches for the school to begin trying to calculate refunds until everyone's registration is pretty much "locked in". A student who adds more classes would be due a smaller refund, and a student who dropped (and didn't replace) a few credit hours would be entitled to a larger refund.<br>  <br>  If you're just now completing the offer/acceptance process for the current semester, it will take at least a week for your aid to arrive.<br>  <br>  If you're way ahead of the game, and you're talking about the process of accepting aid for the Summer or Fall semesters, then I'm afraid your aid isn't going to be disbursed for a few months yet, and your check certainly won't be passed on to you until the school has actually received the aid in your name.<br>  <br>  Remember - "extra" aid isn't really "extra". The money that gets refunded from financial aid is intended (and should always be used for) the "other" educational expenses that are not paid directly to your school. Books, school supplies, room and board, and gas money are the kinds of things that should be purchased with financial aid funds. Also remember that the "extra" money is meant to cover your expenses in the semester that the financial aid is awarded. If you start spending Fall 2009 money now, you won't have any other money to pay for your books and other expenses when September rolls around.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you - I hope this helps!|`|AXoWtzQMaa	ask finanical aid at your school

SyT8pJu6aa	I know what you are going through.  I have dealt with menace children in my son grade now for 5 years.  I had him (son)transferred to another school where his grades greatly improved but with a lack of communication through the school he was placed back in his old school.  He is now in 5th grade and I see the what the experience has done to him and I hate to see him this way.  I would talk to the teacher and see what she can do.  Or ask her what can be done.  Ask other parents what they see and then go to the school board.  Maybe the school can get the child into counseling|`|JCdBSULraa	Well if you're in California, you're probably going to have to wait until he hurts someone, then the victim can be kicked out of school so the teachers can focus on the problem child more.   I'd move, personally.
2daf1f643b0222e20fe97c10246019f0aa	You are really cutting it close!  I would call the registrar's office at the college for which you applied, and check the status of your application.  Not to sound like a smarty, but always allow 3 months before applying to any college where financial aid is concerned. Good luck.
aHN5fDwQaa	T4, T8, T10 and L5 are the names of certain vertebrae in your spine. <br>  <br>  Scoliosis is a curvature of the spine. The dextro- prefix would indicate a curvature to the right. Levo- would be curvature to the left. The number of degrees tells you how severe the curvature is. A rotary component would imply some twisting of the spine in addition to the curvature.<br>  <br>  But, yeah, you should have your doctor explain, show you the xrays, etc.|`|3258fd9ca0baa8e13a1a5449e7bdca00aa	They're talking about the amount and type of curvature your spine has in both your upper back ("T" for thoracic, where your ribs are) and your lower back ("L" for lumbar, below your ribcage).<br>  <br>  A doctor can explain it better than I can, so you should ask a doctor about it.  Better yet, you need to talk to YOUR doctors and have THEM explain it.  Communicating clearly with you is part of their job, and they need to do better than it sounds like they're doing.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	You should ask your Dr  to explain this to you in fact they're suppose to
YUk1iBwXaa	Are you using a school computer? If so, then the teacher and school has a right to monitor and restrict student web and software usage. There are many reasons why they do this - for student safety and to keep students focused on the lesson at hand. A substitute teacher recently went to court regarding improper web sites (accidentally) being shown in class. It's hard for students to understand, but it really is for your best interest. <br>  <br>  The web can still be a fun and interesting place to utilize in class, but if you want to surf the web for personal reasons, you need to do it on your own time.

KwuTnnNUaa	I agree with the others who said you have an extremely gifted girl there.  The links they gave are good.  Hoagies, particularly I have used with my gifted son.  It has links to everything....behavior. syndromes, perfectionism (which it sounds like your daughter has and is common in extremely gifted kids), programs, etc.  <br>  <br>  I want to note that introversion is more common in highly gifted kids than the general population, but her problem may just be that there are no people that think like her and she can't find the friend she needs.  Getting her into a program where there are other gifted kids more like her would be good for her.  <br>  <br>  Anyway here is a link to section in Hoagies that deals with sensitivities in gifted kids.  It has many good articles in it.  I particularly like the one called "Overexcitabilities" by Dabrowski.<br>  <br>  I also agree with the person who said you should let her read to her intellectual level.  My son read Jurassic Park at 7 yrs old and "The Universe in a Nutshell" by Stephen Hawking at 9. Let her go with her interests!  She will surprise you!<br>  <br>  Look into talent searches in your state.  They offer "above level" testing which can be very revealing and open doors for differentiated education for her, which it seems like she needs by what you said.<br>  <br>  Good luck in finding the right education for her.  Your efforts are well worth it!<br>  <br>  Edit:  By the way, introversion is a personality trait and can't really be changed.  My son is an introvert and has no friends he wants to spend his out of school time with at all.  My husband and I have tried his whole life (he's 14) to invite kids over ourselves we thought he might like to be friends with, or entice him to invite kids over he likes, and he just isn't interested.  He is satisfied with having acquaintances at school but being just at home  with family after school and in fact, all summer.  He belongs to clubs, goes out for sports, but doesn't really have any friends.  He seems well adjusted otherwise and we have stopped worrying.|`|AA11247439	have you heard of asperger's syndrome?            i know you said it cant be autism but your view of autism is off  many with high-functioning autism (asperger's is one particular type of highfunctioning autism.      many with asperger's have an excellent vocabulary. Their defecits are not in language skills there defecits are in the use of and interpretation of Non-verbal communication.   ( social cues and body language)<br>  <br>  im not saying she has it because i dont know ur child. but i will say say that until you look over the symptoms dont rule it out.  In girls it is often overlooked and that needs to change. <br>  <br>  i recommend just doing some research on it|`|03rOCajTaa	It sounds like jealousy on the other children's part that they are just calling her stupid. She might be smarter then the other children that they don't understand her when she speaks. Or just plain out jealous of their grades. Their reaction is to call her stupid so they would feel better. Although she is getting high grades she is listen to the other children's remarks. She might want some attention too or maybe she is not getting enough sleep and causing her to think badly of her self. <br>  I kinda went through this with our son. I would want to reward for something good that he did. He would tell me he doesn't deserve a reward and that he is a bad boy. Now through research and talking to doctors and my sister(that has a special need son), he was labeled ODD (Oppositional Defiant Disorder). That causes the child to go against the adult. Yes he has ADHD too. We tried spending more time with him and I think the meds help too. You might want to talk to her school counselor or her teacher about it.|`|AA12022384	I would stop looking for books designed for her age group and find her books suitable for her intellect.  There are several websites which recommend books for gifted children, a few below, you will find many more if you do a google search.  <br>  <br>  You do not say the age of your daughter but at the age of 11, I was reading what would be considered as adult books, I do not mean books with adult content but books written basically for adults, I started to do this as I found most children's books boring, this certainly did me no harm and I have continued to love reading all my life.<br>  <br>  It seems to me that boredom could be a large part of her problems and that of being different, which no child wants.  Take a look at the sites, some are books with gifted children in them, some stories to stimulate gifted children and some are educational materials.<br>  <br>  Maybe getting her music lessons could also help if she has any interest in learning to play an instrument.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ORonhAuvaa	Gifted children often march to the beat of a different drummer. They can be overly responsive to things that happen in their environment. This is especially hard during adolescence because by being different, they don't fit in very well, so their self esteem can go down the tubes.<br>  <br>  I was also a gifted child and I both believed and didn't believe that I was smart. I believed I wasn't smart because I didn't get good grades, but I knew I was smarter than the average person because I knew so much more than the other kids and I could think my way around them with no problems.<br>  <br>  I did not understand how to be fashionable and I didn't want to have anything to do with teen culture because I didn't want to be a clone. I also did not understand boy girl relationships that changed daily. <br>  <br>  If I were you I would do some reading on the characteristics of gifted children. They can be a real pain because they are not like other kids. Knowledge is power. It isn't just about being smart. There is a lot more to it.|`|kVZoeh9paa	Lol, sounds alot like me, except i'm not shy, I love to talk and hang out with people. Shes probally one of those perfectionate gifted children, as I am. For the work on time thing though she might just be procrastinating, it can either be because its to easy, shes too lazy to turn it in, or she just forgets.When I was 10, I read at a level above highschool and I had difficulty finding books for myself because of my age at that time. Find a whole bunch of books of yours that would be appropriate for her to read. And tell her that she should relax, show her how proud you are when she brings home B's and regular A's, maybe that might help with the whole 'Upset over getting anything lower then a "A+."<br>  <br>  Tell her to just ignore the kids calling her stupid, its just jelousy over their part. Watch as they fail the grade.|`|a4eae7763718d60503d3ecc788178132aa	You have a gifted girl...which people will try to label as everything else! It sounds like she is telling you who she is so talk to her and see what she wants to accomplish. Unfortunalty public education doesn't always meet the most unique children's needs. Gifted kids need to be around other gifted kids so look for some home-schoolers or unique activities which atract kids like her- our book store has a book club. Don't hold back on her reading, monitor for appropriateness, but let her decide what she is interested in.<br>  Make yourself a known face at the school, the principal's office and the board of education! You have to fight for appropriate education. Don't be afraid to allow her to skip ahead, if she wants to, in her area of strength. The school will fight you on this but you have to do what's right for her. Listen to her ideas, and become a partnership with her.<br>  Read up on gifted girls, they often differ from gifted boys.<br>  <a href="http://www.hoagiesgifted.org/gender.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hoagiesgifted.org/gender.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gt-cybersource.org/Record.aspx?NavID=0_7&rid=11388" rel="nofollow">http://www.gt-cybersource.org/Record.asp...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.aboutourkids.org/articles/gifted_girls_many_gifted_girls_few_eminent_women_why" rel="nofollow">http://www.aboutourkids.org/articles/gif...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.education.com/reference/article/Ref_Tips_Parents_Ten/" rel="nofollow">http://www.education.com/reference/artic...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.giftedjourney.com/girls.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.giftedjourney.com/girls.html</a>

jWsycLTBaa	Seventh grader Claire Lyons and her parents move from Florida to wealthy Westchester County, NY. As a temporary measure, they stay in a friend's guest house.  The friend's daughter, Massie, is also in the seventh grade, and decides to make Claire's life miserable just to show off in front of her friends. The girls who belong to the Pretty Committee are spoiled, wealthy kids who have been kicked out of OCD, (Octavian Country Day School) where they have been misbehaving.  Claire is not quite up on all the latest trends that are must-haves to be in with the clique, and their un-subtle harassment wears on her nerves.  When the girls are invited to audition for a new movie, Dial L For Loser, they head for L. A. on the movie studio's private jet.  Massie is shocked when, in spite of her new hair extensions and her straight-leg velvet Sevens, it is Claire who snags a starring role, and gets a ticket into a world of extreme fabulousness. Cam, Claire's boyfriend back in Westchester, just hopes that she won't fall for a teen star and forget about him. <br>  Lots of trendy references here... the designer clothes, the PalmPilots, and stops at Starbucks. Calvin Klein is in. So is Ralph Lauren. But Claire's navy platform Keds are expired and Burberry is last year's to die for. <br>  <br>  Teens will recognize themselves in the things kids love to do and the language that is "so in."  This series is best loved by teen girls, and a sequel is in the works.   Fast action and exciting characters make this the series to read this fall. Catch up on the whole series about the super-wealthy!  What fun.<br>  <br>  Secondly one:<br>  Harrison is back with her sixth installment of “The Clique” series. Fans of the series will not be disappointed by this visit to familiar friends Massie, Claire, and the gang. In Dial L for Loser, the girls are beginning to come to grips with their expulsion from the seventh grade at Octavian Country Day School. The first few days of freedom to shop, socialize, and generally spend their parents’ money to exhaustion are fun and carefree. But as time moves on, they begin to get tired of this life and even begin to long for their return to school.<br>  <br>  The girls are given an opportunity to visit a television show to meet their famous idols. Through some interesting turns of event, Claire, Massie, and Alicia are asked to try out for a part in the movie “Dial L for Loser.” Rich, beautiful Massie assumes the part will be hers, but surprisingly, Ked-wearing Claire lands the role. Massie takes out her rage on Claire in many different ways. All in all, it’s another adventure for these often-mean, spoiled, rich, and intriguing girls.<br>  <br>  Dial L for Loser should definitely appeal to fans of the series, and also to girls who enjoy books about the rich. Even though their lifestyles are beyond what most people can identify with, that’s actually part of the fun of reading the books. They allow you to experience something out of the realm of ordinary living. The emotions and reactions of the girls are accurate, though, no matter what your financial background. Many of the friendship, competition, popularity, and other concepts dealt with are universal.<br>  <br>  There is a great deal of brand-name dropping, which can get a little tedious and will probably date these books fairly quickly. And I have serious problems believing that these girls are only in the seventh grade. I think the series would be more credible if they were in high school. These shortcomings aside, Dial L for Loser is a fun, entertaining book that girls are sure to enjoy.|`|2nXBcSfBaa	Go to the library.

i5tOQGgFaa	Our focus letter is Nn this week.  Here are some things we have done or will be doing.  * build Nn with noodles.  * sensory-noodles- you can add a variety to work in sorting, patterning, etc.  Color noodles with rubbing alcohol and food coloring.  * name sort...we do this in various ways through the year but this time we are going to sort newspaper/magazine letters into their appropiate column to match their name.  * write multiple N's and n's with white crayon on white construction paper and let the children use watercolor to paint over top.  If you press hardly with the crayon, the better the effect.  The watercolor will resist teh crayon.  You may wish to do this for Ww.  * We use the focus letter in a song and find all the Nn's and count them.  Even include simple addition by counting upper case and then counting lower case.  The chant we are using for N goes like this.  N is for Nuts  N is for nuts that I like to eat, (form circles with thumbs and fingers)  N is for nest where a bird can sleep. (cup hands together)  N is for net to catch a big fish, (Pretend to net fish)  N is for noodles, my favorite dish. (pretend to eat)  N is for noise, a very loud sound, (cover ears with hands)  N is for nails that I like to pound. (pretend to hammer)   Jean Warren  *  There are quite a few "n" opposites that you can use for a language activity.  I sometimes create picture pairs and glue them onto the block letter.  Night/day; naughty/good; narrow/wide; never/always; noisy/quiet; now/later; near/far; new/old; neat/messy...  *  we use this time to work with number/letter sorts.    Etc    Seussville:  There are a great many books that you can use as jumping boards for rhyming, etc.    One year I took a digital picture of each child wearing a cat in the hat hat and we glued it to a background and added red and white squares in an ABAB pattern and spelled their name.    Dictation:  There's a Wocket in My Pocket...what is in their pocket?  You cut a half piece of construction paper lengthwise and then fold in half and trim to make it look like a pocket.  Write the question, What is in your pocket? and have them write their name on the front and then lift the flap to draw a picture of what could be in their pocket and have them dictate a sentence or two.    Patterning again...make a paper hat using red and white strips.    Make a cat face with uppercase letters and hats with lower case letters (or match upper to upper and lower to lower if that is where they are at developmentally),    Seriation:  remember the little guys a,b, and c?  Use an adult cat in the hat hat and place inside the little guys in different sizes and have them sort from largest to smallest...put the letters on each to reinforce letter recognition/sound/order, etc.    Dr. Seuss' ABC is great intro to alliteration.    Read multiple books and graph favorites    Discuss rainy day activities and create a rainy day bulletin board by having the children list their favorite thing to do on a rainy day. Have them place their ideas on a cut-out of a raindrop. Place the raindrops on the board around a picture of a house and a cat in a hat. Title the board "Fun in the Rain    Collect various pictures of hats and place them around the room. Discuss each hat and when or where you might wear the hat.    I do not claim these as my own original ideas.  Most were ideas from the internet.  If you search Dr. Seuss activities I'm sure you'll come up with many more!    Science:  does it have to be in accordance to your theme?  I strongly suggest you check your local library and see if there are back issues of The Mailbox Preschool magazine.  They have science explorations in every issue!  As well as a great many more very appropiate activities!    Ww  *  Weave  * W picture collage  * Hang up blue b.b. paper or provide individual blue paper and have them practice making W for waves.  \/\/\/\/\/\/\/  (pre writing)  * Wiggly Worm Painting- use  yarn for worms  * Can of worms...read a book about worms/garden; go over w pictures/words; and then provide a simple can on construction paper with the word worms on it. Use narrow paintbrushes and brown paint to make the worms.  * cut strips of paper for free cutting and then provide them to glue and make w's...same for x's  * Do a share 'n' tell session and have the children bring in something made of wood to share about.  * W is for water...lots of ideas there!  Our kids like to "go fishing".  I put water in a plastic dish tub and magnetic letters and numbers.  You can sort by whether it is a letter/number or sort letters by sticks, curves, or both.  * Playdough "worms" to make the letter... can be used for the other letters as well.      Good luck on Xx!  That is one of the letters that I have very few ideas collected for.  We always incorporated xrays.

PnlgLBcwaa	what country are you in  I am guessing you want to be a pediatric nurse (RN)    i don't think there are specific nursing degrees for autism    You could consider ebign a school nurse (with a masters degree) in the US and apply to schools for children with autism...    but there are no austim nurses in my area-just school nurses taht happen to work in a school for autism--they don't specifically provide autism intervention--tehy provide medical care related to any condition...      there are teachers, speech therapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, etc....|`|mx3gFmIKaa	You would want to get your RN first and then certified as a developmental nurse.

In the mean time just adhere to whatever rules they've got going, its a stupid trivial thing to get suspended over.|`|1yGDFTieaa	That's pretty extreme but maybe the school felt as if they had/have no other alternative.  Kind of like saying 'you've got to be cruel to be kind'.    All schools want their students to look smart, whilst I personally disagree with suspending a student for the reasons you listed, uniform policies are there for a reason.|`|a7af1498bf28d2d09a7253c7e912f958aa	That's stupid! You can understand them wanting everyone to dress well and look smart but that is taking it to the extreme. I agree, they should tell you the first time, detention the second and a phone call home after that. I don't think it's fair to be suspended, lessons being missed is more of a problem than wearing a different colour bobble or socks or something.|`|IdgfE5Khaa	OMG i fought our school was bad but this is just pathetic.

kJ4g1vujaa	100  its an intelligence test not an age test.|`|skxhE5owaa	Well, the IQ system is made so that 100 is the national average, but that's meant for adults usually.  Then again, IQ tests aren't that good, they can be really inaccurate at times, so shouldn't be taken that seriously :D  That being said, anything about 85-105 is average ^_^|`|oIpsJ3Bgaa	IQ (intelligence quotient) doesn't change with age.  It is the intelligence level that you are born with.  The average IQ dictated by the test is 100 because of how your score is determined.  IQ isn't a good predictor of success in life, though.  More and more psychologists are considering using EQ (emotional quotient) testing as a way of success prediction.  I hope I helped :)
wgFZGMEtaa	Your extra curriculars are good, your improvement and reasons are great, but I don't think it will be enough for USC.

Hope for the best.|`|fWOk5Mktaa	Great Extracurriculars, but your gpa may be too low and your act score is decent. If you can retake your SAT 2 for history or try a another subject and get in the high 600s that will be better.

y02PZj22aa	You are being asked to think about the changes that occurred in the years following Spain's sponsoring the voyages of Christopher Columbus.  Specifically, what changes occurred in Europe?  What changes occurred in North America? Central America? the Caribbean Islands? South America?  What changes occurred in Africa?    Once you have made a list of the changes that occurred, think about how people in those places were changed by events.  What changed as far as their interaction with other people?  What changed as far as their ownership of property, their ability to support themselves, their prospects for prosperity in the future, their station in life relative to their social class?  What changed as far as their religious practices?    The time period involved starts in 1492, the year of Columbus' first voyage, and ends in 1750, roughly the start of the Industrial Revolution.  During that time period, Martin Luther started the Protestant Reformation (1517), European countries expanded trade and collected tariffs, political theorists became anti-monarch (influencing the framers of the U.S. Constitution and influencing the later American Revolution (1776) and the French Revolution (1798)). Those might be starting points for your analysis.    You didn't say how long this essay should be.  There is enough material available for multiple volumes, should you want to write a book on it.  If it's a 2-page essay, I'd concentrate on Spain's influence in the Americas (brought Catholicism, took away what treasures they could, nearly eliminated several indigenous peoples), England's influence on settling North America (viewed indigenous peoples as Godless savages and eliminated them), the introduction of enslaved Africans to Caribbean islands and to North America, and the excesses of the ruling monarchies of Europe, and I'd mention the huge changes that began with the invention of movable type and other mechanical devices that eventually revolutionized the production of nearly everything and made possible the rise of a middle class of citizens.  I would also mention the changes in family structure and expectations that occurred, particularly in Europe and among white settlers in North America.|`|UKFL4wNVaa	You are looking at the effect of trade on society. How did people change because of it.     Having Africa listed probably means they expect you to analyse the impact of slavery on the economy. How did society change when there was suddenly a lower class which was owned, which had no rights and which created huge amounts of wealth for a limited number of people?     Also you could look at changes in politics, this is the period which immediately predated the American revolution, so people's ideas of government and their expectations were beginning to change at this point. Some of this will have been caused by the interaction of different cultures and social levels as people moved into the American continent.     I put this search into google and found several sources :   social and economic transformation 1492-1750|`|Irr5ftN7aa	This has to do with the slave trade, which is also called "triangle trade." This referred to the importing and exporting of goods from Britain, Africa, the West Indies, and the Southern and Northern Colonies.     Each country had goods that they were willing to export in order to import something desireable. During the 17th, 18th, and early 19th centuries, the main goods imported/exported between the aforementioned countries were rum, sugar, molasses, cotton, lumber, and slaves. This drove economies, and provided a transformation of the Atlantic world. Slaves helped to build the southern economy, creating contracts among Western Europe, Africa and the Americas during the time leading up to the American Revolution.     This is a very broad question, but the triangle trade/slave trade was the first thing that came to mind. You might try googling for additional information.

ea9d38bcb3c95c09375bdff6ba923d51aa	the best thing I can say is before you open your mouth, wait three seconds to formulate a thought.    I think the reason why ppl say "ummm" and "ahhh" so much, is because we jump ahead.    Just try taking your time to know what you are actually talking about and see if it helps.

Edward Cullen  *"Besides... the more time I spend with you, the more human emotions seem comprehensible to me. I'm discovering that I can sympathize with Heathcliff in ways I didn't think possible before."  Edward Cullen    In Breaking Dawn: my favorite will always be that last line..  "And then we continued blissfully into this small but perfect piece of our forever."    ..as you can see, I usually like Edward's lines because they tend to be with deeper meanings! I LOVE IT..    =d

IGcS9K62aa	Honestly, you can't really write a persuasive paper one something that does not have to clear sides. You want to persuade someone to have a certain opinion on a topic, preferably the opinion you want them to have. To do so, you need to have clearly defined opinions. All M&M's are made on the same equipment, with the same products, in the same manner. Based on that there's not even clear evidence that one could have justifiable opinion that they taste different. Also you can't make generalizations that "some people think it [color] matters". Have studies been done? Is it common knowledge (does 95% of the population know) that some individuals think color matters?     I suggest you change your topic. Do something that has clearly define opinions. Some possible topics that are most certainly divisive: abortion, stem cell research, school uniforms, video game violence, global warming, cloning. I included some links that have all sorts of topics, the first link is especially good.    Sorry I had to burst your topic idea. I'm all for quirky papers, but it just won't work let alone get you a good grade! Anyways, good Luck!|`|oUNST2Zgaa	it depends on what ur persuading people to do..    they taste different    or     they dont taste different    ur paper is the second one

The psalms give an idea of what morals, values, judgment one should have.  However, they are crippled because they do not show human instinct or human flaws.  They say that there is forgiveness, however there is no one who will forgive.  These hypocritical people (for example: the people conducting witch hunts in Salem) tend to accuse free-thinking people of being witches or being evil.  Basically, if you act like a human you are doomed to go to hell.|`|6DYLRdBfaa	The most obvious religious connotation is the reference to psalms, a book of the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament of the Christian Bible, containing songs.

I believe middle school and high school are the bricks that form a house, its where you learn to learn yourself.

So to get the total price from the comission, divide the comission amount by 0.08, because the total price was MULTIPLIED by 0.08 to get the comission, so you must do the reverse and divide it.    Comission/percentage = total sale price.    So 1,240 divided by 0.08, or 1,240/0.08, equals 15,500.    1240/0.08 = 15,500.    To check your answer, multiply 15,500 by 8%, or 0.08, and you get the correct comission price of 1,240.|`|OoihsiN0aa	1240/.08

Son momentos de la vida en que empiezas a hacer tu propia eleccin y si te equivocas no es tan grave .   No te sirve que te de una lista de profesiones o carreras si no tenes claro cual es tu vocacin y podes combinarla con una futura profesin.   En internet podes encontrar carreras clasicas y nuevas con distinto grado de duracin y exigencia.    Tene en cuenta que toda profesion tiene un estudio teorico y un ejercicio en la practica que son distitos.    Necesitas "informacion " profesional y no orientacin.    Tomate tiempo para elegir y luego busca a un profesional recibido y consultalo por su trabajo.

Y el permetro de un cuadrado es 4 veces la longitud de uno de sus lados     Entonces    Sea PA permetro de A     PA = 4a    PB =  4b     Coma PA = PB + 24,  de ah tenemos que:    4a   =  4b  + 24    dividiendo ambos lados de la ecuacin entre 4 tenemos que:    a   =  b + 6    Sustituyendo este valor de a en funcion de b (a= b +6) en la ecuacin obtenido en  El inciso 8 (     a2  =  b2   + 180)    Quedaria como sigue:      (b+6)2 = b2   + 180    desarrollando el cuadrado del binomio de la izquierda:    b2 +12b +36  =  b2   + 180    luego hacemos las siguiientes simplificaciones:      12b = b2   + 180 -  b2   - 36    12b = b2   + 180 -  b2   - 36    12b = 144  b = 144/12  b = 12  a = b + 6 = 12 + 6 = 18    Area del cuadrado menor  =  B    B =  b2  =  (12)2   B = 144        A =  B  + 180  A = 324       Respuesta al problema 2    Sea a el numero,  Entonces a + 5 es el numero aumentado en 5    Tenemos que el cuadrado del numero aumentado en 5 (a+5) 2  Es igual al cuadrado del numero (a2 ) mas 185    entonces    (a+5) 2 = a2  + 185    haciendo operaciones con esta ecuacin, tenemos que el lado izquierdo es un binomio al  cuadrado , y queda como sigue:    a2 +2(5)a+25 = a2  + 185    Simplificando :  10a = a2  + 185 - a2 - 25    10a = a2  + 185 - a2 - 25  10a = 185 - 25    10a = 160    a   = 160/10  el numero buscado es:  a =16    para comprobar    (16 )2  = 256    el numero aumentado en 5 es (16 +5)=21    21 2  = 441    el cuadrado del numero aumentado en 5  ((16+5) 2 ) es igual  al cuadrado del numero 256  + 185 = 441  que es 21 elevado al cuadrado      tengo el documento en word, si lo quieres contactame via email, mi email esta en el perfil|`|e0dd4c5419f9e86a5a40e4ddbff46d5daa	Hola . ya resolvi la primera pregunta, la segunda tendria que analizarla mas.( es solo un juego de palabras , en lo que entiendas el enunciado lo resulves rapidisimo.) Aqui esta la primera: Superficie del 2do = A2, superficie del 1ero = A1, Perimetro del 2do = P2, perimetro del 2do = P1,     A2= 180(cm al cuadrado) + A1  P2 = 24 (cm) + P1    sabemos que para un cuadrado tenemos  A= lado^2             (^2 significa que esta al cuedrado)  P = 4* lado   A1= L1^2   ;     A2= L2 ^2  P1 = 4*L1  ;     P2= 4*L2    como se tiene A2= 180(cm al cuadrado) + A1, sustituimos A2 y A1por A1= L1^2   ;     A2= L2 ^2    Nos queda que L2 ^2= 180 +  L1^2 (llamaremos a esta ecuacion , EC1)    por otro lado tenemos a P2 = 24 (cm) + P1, pero P1= 4*L1 , P2= 4*L2, haciendo lo mismo que hicimos en la EC1; tenemos,    4*L2= 24 + 4*L1 ( llamaremos a esta ecuacion EC2)      Ahora trabajando con la EC2, despejando L2 nos queda    L2 = 24/4 + (4*L1)/4,    L2= 6 + L1 (EC3)    sustituyendo EC3 en la EC1 tenemos;  (6+L1)^2= 180 + L1^2;    (EC4)     pero (6+ L1)^2 = 6^2 + 2*6*L1 + L1^2= 36 + 12*L1+ L1^2    otra vez a la EC4 tenemos;   36 + 12*L1+ L1^2= 180 + L1^2;  despejando L1 tenemos;  L1= (180+36)/12      ; (los L1^2 se anulan)  L1 = 12 cm    , finalmente P1 = 4*(12cm)= 48cm    Como L2= 6+L1;  L2=6+ 12= 18cm  P2 = 4* L2= 4*(18cm)= 72 cm .

yJSPecgoaa	A great site to find a good college is collegeboard.com.    If you click on Find a College, you then are asked a series of questions (e.g. large college or small; preferred geographical area, desired major; GPA etc.).  After answering the questions, a list of colleges that meet your preferences and criteria will appear.    For example, based solely on the information you've given above, a list of 133 east coast schools with marketing programs appear.  You can see the list here: http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/se...    Of course, you know better what your preferences etc. are, so after you answer all the questions, you will have an even more refined list than this.

So "are" is a linking verb, too.|`|AA11524142	C. ("are")|`|e9cd20204a255e1581a9baed6d56a737aa	Basically, a linking verb is a verb that links the subject and its complement ; and a subject complement is a phrase that defines or completes the meaning,the being or the 'what' of the subject. Hence, the subject without its comlement becomes incomplete in its meaning.    Therefore, in the above question, the sentence in which the verb is a linking verb is "His hours are long and busy." This is because the verb 'are' links the subject 'His hours' and the subject complement 'long and busy.'     However,this answer is only grammatical. Semantically, it goes further to other details,which can even disprove the practicality of the sentence.
rwQiydoVaa	why does it happen? i have no idea...   i suggest for u to talk to your counselor about this.  AND since u already "knew" that your biology teacher hates u, u could of talked to the counselor about ur grades in that class and he/she may change ur bio teacher for you.  it worked for me.  oh, and if your counselor still says no, make sure u have back-up. talk to your parents about ur grades/teacher the day before or something and ask them to PLEASE write a note for the counselor for u to switch ur teacher.  pull out that ppr if ur counselor says no.   remember to make up really good excuses or something before talking to ur counselor.   oh, and as for ur math, hopefully u can have a tutor or your friend to help u with any problems u have.  and i remember when i was in goemetry, it has a lot of proofs, slope/distance/midpoint/etc.. formulas. u should study them and try to remember all of the formulas and the proofs. this can really REALLY help u get a better understanding of them and can help u during tests.   hoped i helped!

The stories we tell are the stuff of dreams. Fairy tales don't come true. Reality is much stormier. Much murkier. Much scarier.

If I were you I would have done a Management degree plus a green technology degree. Otherwise if you dont want to do finance, you may be out of luck because finance and technology really dont mix unless you want to be an accoutant for a green technology company or keep track of finances or drop it altogether and become a green technology researcher instead. Good luck  BTW I am a Manangement degree holder with a joint degree in the medical sciences.

q41iIqefaa	Yes its an Alice in Wonderland reference. There is a character in it called the Hatter and he is mad. But the actual first use of the phrase was back in the Victorian times in the town of Stockport, in England. One of Stockports main industries was hat making. In the factories they used dangerous chemicals to treat the fabric. Over time the people who worked in the factories developed lung disorders from breathing in the chemicals they were exposed to everyday at work. They also think that the chemicals could have also damaged their brains kaking them mad.   Even today, people from the town of Stockport are called Hatters.|`|6YXqIlLiaa	It's from Alice in Wonderland.

2jJQ66O7aa	Here are the two explanations I found....    The phrase's earliest recording is from 1546 as "wolde you bothe eate your cake, and have your cake?" (John Heywood's 'A dialogue Conteinyng the Nomber in Effect of All the Prouerbes in the Englishe Tongue') alluding to the impossibility of eating your cake and still having it afterwards; the modern version (where the clauses are reversed) is a corruption which was first signaled in 1812.  _______________    From "Random House Dictionary of Popular Proverbs and Sayings" by Gregory Y. Titelman:    "You can't have your cake and eat it too -- One can't use something up and still have it to enjoy. This proverb was recorded in the book of proverbs by John Heywood in 1546, and is first attested in the United States in the 1742 'Colonial Records of Georgia' in 'Original Papers, 1735-1752.' The adage is found in varying forms: You can't eat your cake and have it too. You can't have everything and eat it too; Eat your cake and have the crumbs in bed with you, etc. ..."
aQ8o4w3Xaa	Because these days around 5 in 10 people are going to college/university. That means a lot more people are going to be highly qualified! If you don't have a degree, you're putting yourself at a sever disadvantage.   At first, yes, you will get into debt and no doubt it will take some years to pay off, but with a degree you're going to end up with a better job over all that those who don't go to university. That means you'll be able to pay it back in maybe 10 year and then you'll still be reaping the rewards after wards.   Personally, I'm studying Dramatic Arts in order to pursue a career in acting. So, that's the main reason for coming to Uni for me. My boyfriend though, is studying maths. He still isn't sure what he wishes to do, but he knows he wil be well equipped to get a job that he has interest in after he leaves Uni.   College/uni isn't for everybody, and for some people it won't help the as it isn't needed for the career of their choice. But for the majority of people I'd say it is. Not to mention, it also gives one a little more life experience before going out into the world of work.    Good luck!  :)|`|nmIwP3PQaa	Personally i want to become a criminal law barrister and for most jobs now you need a degree.|`|E32WT03yaa	Its almost impossible to find employment in the field I want without a degree|`|OXKTGW0uaa	I want to be a nurse... and there is no way in hell you can do that without going to university or college!

Not going to university or college closes a lot of doors for you, but for some people post secondary education just isn't for them!

R5UIMBvcaa	The reason is probably that "tabletop" has been in the language far longer than "pushbutton."

You can resist being drawn into something you don't want to do, for example, without being offensive about it.  But if you've already mastered that technique, then no problem!|`|yWuE91npaa	i can completely relate to you except for me it is still going on - i manage to speak my mind every now and then when it gets too much for me like when someone calls me or they call someone else and i feel i have too tell them where to go n that. i dont think its bad for you too speak your mind, hey its better than bottleing it all up untill you explode one day and end up in a psych ward.|`|ChuhyvEaaa	I think that it is important to speak your mind and express your opinions but I also think that there should be a certain level of tact involved. I don't think that if you think somebody is ugly, stupid, or whatever that you should tell them. Also, if you are in a conversation on a touchy subject and you have an opinion that could possibly offend someone else in the group, then I think that you shouldn't speak your mind.     So I guess it's definitely a good thing in cases and a bad thing in others. It just depends on the situation because some things are bettter left unsaid.|`|thpFyZuqaa	Its a bad thing      Im exactly the same, im not 1 to "hide" stuff what i think...  Its not good at all tho, i recently got kicked out of college for speaking my mind.

ISWrs9G2aa	For both career choices, you will learn much more in college than you can in high school.  High school just doesn't give enough specific detail like that.      The thing to do is to get into a college that has strong programs in both areas.  If you can get into the school, you will be able to take any major you want.  Your high school classes are good for two things - to get good grades overall so you can get into a good college, and to make college courses easier by knowing the background material.    Once you get into a good school, if you decide to go the veterinary route you will get into a pre-vet program (which will be very similar to the pre-med program), which will have lots and lots of biology and chemistry classes.  The more bio and chem you take in high school, the easier it will be to do well in these classes.  You will probably end up majoring in biology.  How well you do in the pre-vet program in college will determine whether you are able to get into a veterinary school.  It's pretty much the same process as getting into med school.  You will not be qualified to become a vet after your bachelor's degree.    If you decide to go the banking route, it honestly doesn't matter much what you take in high school.  If your school offers economics, take that.  If it offers anything like finance or accounting, take those too.  Other than that, just get good grades overall and get into a good college.  You'll be able to major in business, and again, how well you do in your major will determine whether you can get into a good school for your MBA (which is pretty much required to advance past a certain point in the banking world).|`|ENJ0bY48aa	Neither one of your majors have additional acceptance rules.  The school won't change their acceptance decision based upon which of the two majors you choose.  Most business schools accept students before their 3rd year of college.  You typically need to have taken a set number of courses and have a B average (3.0).    Why not major in business and if you decide business isn't for you, go to veterinary school?  It is a 4 year post-bachelors program and they don't care what your major is as long as you have taken the prerequisite coursework.  Or you could become a vet tech and work part time to determine if that job is for you.    You don't need to know anything about the stock market or anything else.  You will learn it all in school.

bC0KRacHaa	Oh that's a tough situation.  First, good for you for taking care of Cathy.  You could go back again to your teacher, when you are alone, like after she dismisses the class, you could be the last one out and tell her, "Excuse me, Mrs. _____.  I want to tell you again that I did not tell Cathy to say any bad words.  It makes me feel bad that you don't believe me."  Sometimes teachers don't know what to believe.  They're only human afterall and make mistakes.  But teachers are usually working as teachers because they care about students, and if you go to her sincerely and tell her how you feel about this, she will definitely take it into consideration.     One thing I don't get is if Cathy can't speak... how could she even say a bad word anyway?|`|QBFANhXaaa	Talk to the teacher in person and tell them that you never said that to Cathy.

Ur gonna have to do some work yourself|`|3598384bbc66da8ed96bec880601acc7aa	The easiest way is to just look at them and order them.  If you cannot do that you have to find what is called the LCD (Least Common Denominator)  That is the smallest number that the bottom digit of the fraction can go into. For example the LCD of 1/3 and 1/4 is "12".  This is because that is the lowest number that both the 3 and the 4 can divide into evenly.  The LCD for your problem would be 60. The next step is to make every fraction have the demominator 60.  The way to do this is to "scale them up" for example: 3/4 would be 45/60.  You find this out be looking at the denominators the 4 goes into 60, 15 times, and so does the 3.  This is because i found out about the 4 doing that 15 times so I multiplied the 3 times 15 which gave me 45.  Do this for all the fractions. and you will get:    1/5 = 12/60  1/4 = 15/60  1/3 = 20/60  2/5 = 24/60  1/2 = 30/60  2/3 = 40/60  3/4 = 45/60  4/5 = 48/60    (IN ORDER FROM LEAST TO GREATEST)                I think you can figure out least to greatest from here|`|kI36WRdoaa	multiply them all so they will have the same denominator
8idLIc84aa	Use slope-intercept form to find the equation.    Slope-intercept: y = mx + b    Replace the values that you know already: the y- value, the x- value and the value for slope, m.    -2 = 2(-1) + b  -2 = -2 + b  0 = b    The equation in slope-intercept form is y = 2x    To get that to standard form subtract the 2x from both sides and you get:    -2x + y = 0    I believe that's it's preferred that the x not be negative, so multiply everything by -1 and the final answer is    2x - y = 0|`|VkIRQmEHaa	Use the point-slope form equation first, y-2 = 2(X-1) and then solve it u should get y=2x then move the x to the other side to become 2x+y=0.

o0I5YXMNaa	Hi.  There's a couple of good ideas already and space is short to do justice to a full answer, but for some more ideas:    Write down and include your past relative experience, noting dates and what you felt about that particular experience/s.  Include any projects and explain what you gained from them and how they relate to our studies.  Include what your aspirations are and what you intend to do and what you would really prefer to do.  Include any research and list of books read.  In mine, I include lecture notes and write check list of who, what, where, when and what I thought of the lecture/learning experience i.e. whether it was relevant/useful/challenging etc.  Sometimes I note down what was omitted and/or what might have been included.    It is important to show that you can be an autonomous learner, well motivated and a portfolio is a way of doing that.  So include website links, relevant TV programmes/videos. Include photographs and other art works.    Include any past work experience even if it is not relevant to what you are doing now.     Also include things that are not necessarily for others to see, but your own thoughts about how you think and would like to do and then when you are at an interview or whatever,  select what you want for that particular event and leave the rest for your own personal use or for later use.    Include critiques on some journal articals/lectures to show you understand what is valid. (johns might be useful)    Include personal interests and hobbies and any difficulties you might have to overcome to achieve certain things etc.    By doing this, you will find it easier to understand your own preferred learning style so you could include a paragraph about that and reference it.    Try to reference as much as possible - it will pay off later.    Make a contents and/or index and cross reference subjects and ideas.    Don't feel overwhelmed, once you start it begins to make sense and just keep adding throughout your working life.    Warm thoughts for you studies, I hope you  do really well.    Portfolio stationary can actually be purchased but I prefer to make my own.    There is also a good book which might be available in your library called something like "Your portfolio".  There are also websites.|`|hktbfRPWaa	Include things you've written or been involved in. If you haven't gotten involved in anything maybe try to find something    Ask your teachers for some ideas|`|ISWrs9G2aa	Short answer - you put in it things that you have written.    You can start with a couple of your best school papers, but you will definitely want stuff from out of school.  Have you worked on your school's newspaper or other publications?  Have you ever had anything published?  If not, you need to start getting involved with that stuff.  Look for freelance writing work you can do - that would allow you to get paid and also have items to include in your portfolio.  I'm not sure what media, specifically, your media studies include, but you should be able to produce work in them and put that in your portfolio too.    It would probably be best to set up a website with links to all of your portfolio items.  That way you could include this website on you resume and potential employers could visit and actually read some of your work.

Fnp2MIycaa	I'm assuming that when you say Vet you mean Veterinarian.    History of Veterinarians.  What we call " veterinary medicine " has been around as long as people and animals have worked and lived together.      People that study history have found Chinese writings about the diseases of horses, oxen, and buffalo that go all the way back to about 2,500 B.C. Some 4,000 years old Indian art show some men caring for horses and elephants. The Ancient Egyptian art shows how they make sure that their cattle and dogs health is well.    It is not surprising that culturesthat need animals for farming, food, and transportation try to find ways to keep their animals healthy. The Ancient Romans had a word for the people that are doctors for animals, which is, veterinarius.     In about A.D. 500 a Roman wrote a book on what veterinarians do. Nothing else was written after that until a thousand years later another book was written. The book was called Anatomy of the Horse and was written by an italian, Carlo Ruini, in 1598.    For more than a hundred years, the people that worked with horses were called farriers. These people worked on what vets would normally work on, the forging and applying of the iron shoes to horses hooves to protect their feet. They also worked with the horses injuries and illnesses.    They had to learn their skills by working directly with the animals because they didn't go to college. They knew a lot about stuff that is ordinary to know but they didn't know a lot about science. Sometimes when the farriers worked on the animals it was primitive and hurtful to the animals and it didn't work.     The first school that taught people about scientific veterinary was in Europe in the mid-eighteenth century-less than three hundred years ago. It has gotten bigger as time goes.    In the end of the nineteenth century excellent veterinary schools have been established in the United States.     When a University called Cornell University opened in Ithaca, New York opened it had only two classrooms and one professor which was Dr. James Law. He was taught in Scotland. Dr. Law was the first person to become a professor that taught veterinary medicine in the United States.

ISWrs9G2aa	If you are motivated enough to figure out what you really want to do, then take the time off.  Don't fall into the trap of putting off college forever and never getting a degree, and don't drift aimlessly.      If you are disciplined enough not to do that, then take the semester off and spend that time trying an internship or applying to other schools.  You definitely don't want to spend 18k a semester if you're not getting your money's worth in education and career preparation out of it.|`|OXKTGW0uaa	If you hate the path that you're on or aren't feeling very happy about it I would recommend taking a semester off but before you do that try planning what you are going to do with that semester.. don't just spend it sitting around and getting nothing done. Maybe work for a little while and then go traveling... that might help you to decide what it is you want to do with your education. And it's true, some people who take time off of school never go back but that's partially because they have found something else that they want to do with their life that doesn't involve going to school. Whatever you do don't end up somewhere where you aren't happy with what you are doing.|`|qQT2shZPaa	well, most people who take "a" semester off, never come back, do you want to graduate with your degree? and become successful with a career.

ISWrs9G2aa	It depends on what exactly you want to do.  If you intend to work at your gym as a trainer or nutrition counselor, you'll need to be qualified to do that.  This would be kind of like having your own practice as a nutritionist or something, with enhanced facilities for your clients to work in.  It would also probably have lower start-up costs since you could start smaller and maybe wouldn't have to hire many employees.  However, if you wanted to expand you would eventually need to hire people.    If you want to own the business and run it, hiring other people to work directly with your customers, then you should make sure to take some classes in small business management or entrepreneurship, but you don't have to actually major in them unless you want to.  As an entrepreneur, nobody is going to be judging you based on your major, it's not like you have to meet an employer's requirements.  Just take all the courses that you think will teach you something valuable about either fitness or business, and major in whichever one you find most interesting.|`|74d0314d951419373b6d20225e56bf24aa	If you are planning to own and run a business, I advise that you take business courses.

Since asked to add -15 & -8, first move 15 units to the left of zero. Then move 8 units further left.

rwQiydoVaa	haha. i remember when i used to be afraid of going to high school.. so, i know the feeling.  1) well, i would suggest for u to start getting the supplies for school BEFORE school starts. why? cause it's very hard to find the supplies u need for school like in the first month once school starts because they usually run out quickly. so, better stock up now. for binders, some of your  teachers will need u to have a binder for THAT class only. like about 1/2'' or a 1'' binder. otherwise, my other classes need notebooks.  2) dont worry about getting lost! in the first day of school, my friends and i went to school early so that we can get our schedules then go around and get to recognize the school. it's not that bad when u have your friends around.  3) lol. i dont think that there will be a grade that u should avoid. at my high school, when i was a freshmen, the sophomores, juniors, and the   seniors are really nice. BUT i heard that sophomores are usually mean cause they were freshmen last year and they think that they are now able to pick on the "fresh meat". (fresh meat?! mean right? it's a way some ppl call the freshmen at my school. -___-)  4) hmm they dont play pranks. but, if they do, it's usually with the boys. x]  5) no way!!! my mom used to work at my school! it's ok!. plus, i have two other friends whos mom works at the school. one of them is a librarian while my other friends mom works in the office. it's really ok. nothing to worry about.  6) do: join as many clubs as u can! joining clubs & sports can help u get to know many ppl and have school spirit. don't: slack off and procrastinate with homeworks and studying. (i learned it the hard way >.  7) umm i would say, stay away from those nosy, rude, and those girls who think that they own the school. (rolls eyes.) D:  8) nope. i dont think that they really care... ppl mistaken me with my age a lot.  9) just dont get into trouble and stay away huge groups. oh, and do not hang out with ppl who u cant keep secrets with. (they will most likely spread rumors)  10) umm im not really sure about this. try talking to ur counselor. they can help a lot with these stuff. u should talk to them whenever u have any questions/worries about school.  11) girls do not bully me. x]  12) nope. i haven't had that problem with the guys yet..  13) nope. hopefully, they wouldnt. i mean, just dont do anything around them that would upset them.  14) um. i never got pranked on my strangers but i did by my friends. (they were just playing. ahaha, silly them. :D ) somehow, they found out my lockers combination  's and while i wasnt at school yet, they posted like a bunch of rainbow post-it notes all over inside my locker. lol. it was hilarious.    there is NO NEED to be afraid! everyone has to go through high school and i understand how high school can be frightening at first. u will get used to it.   no worries yeah?  i hoped this gives u a good picture about high school.  hoped i helped. :]|`|44f971d7ae1936193e159c0b3819760baa	Throw your whole list in the trash and just take it as it comes.

Except you should keep quiet and reserved until you find your nitch. Every school is different, you have to feel your way through it. You'll be alright... there are millions of freshmen that survive each year. Don't stress.     You'll find that as you get older (junior/senior) people start not caring about underclassmen. If you get picked on, it'll probably be by a sophomore. But I wouldn't worry. Keep reserved, find your nitch. Don't get involved in the first "nitch" you come across right away. Feel it out for a couple weeks. Stick to this, and you'll be golden. Good luck.|`|nci2WOYXaa	There will be an orientation that you'll have to go to. That will cover about all your questions. If your wondering about what groups to be in and what groups to avoid, that all depends on you. If your brainy, you'll join the smart kids. Smoker, smoking kids. Whatever. You'll find your group, probably at the orientation. Don't worry about the bully crap. Its all alot of hype anyway. No one ever plays pranks on you. If they did they would be suspended. The school has a strict no hazing policy in place. Alot of the girls in Freshman and sophomore year actually get asked out by older guys, at least they did in my school. For guys its harder to date an older girl though. For some reason girls don't like to date down. Anyway, orientation should explain alot of it. Nothing to worry about

I don't know the point schemes but I do now that say she got a high level B and you got a low level B although  they would both be recorded as Bs she would have more points for it than you. I can only suppose this is what happened and that's how she got more points. Although her grades were the same they might have been higher in points, still very harsh on you though. I doubt there was very much in it at all.     Appeal to the school, I really hope they let you in. Surely they cannot keep you out for less than a point???? Most schools just say you need 5 A*-Cs and you got that so if they won't let you in why don't you try another? Good luck!

QG8Ejd3saa	I don't go to Union, but I have had teachers, professors, and coworkers who did, and I live a couple blocks from it.  And no one else answered your question so I figured I would help you out.    Union is generally perceived to be a very good top-notch school.  Schenectady has a bad reputation but for the most part it is outdated hearsay.  I have lived here for some time and I have never felt unsafe.  Just stay away from the less-friendly looking neighborhoods (they stand out - run down buildings, etc.)  This depends on where you are coming from.  If you are from New York State, you know how neglected and run-down our cities tend to be.  If you are from elsewhere, you might be a little surprised at the condition of even our villages.  But don't let that detract you from Union.    From everything I've heard about Union, it's a good school.  I listen to their radio station almost all day, every day, and there seems to be a lot of diversity and a lot of really intelligent people there.  It's also a very attractive school in what is probably the nicest neighborhood in the city.  It has at least one National Historic Landmark on its campus.

Distance learning has certainly come a long way since I finished my MBA via this route some 12 years ago. Today many fine universities now offer some degree programs in this mode. However, IMO, psychology as a "healing art" requires more intimate contact with the subject matter: other people. Although one may certainly acquire a fundamental understanding of the field's main theories and concepts via distance learning (or self-paced learning for that matter; there are many good books on the subject), the acquisition of the interpersonal skills to become proficient in the field is severely lacking in the DL mode, no matter how good the video streaming is or how well scripted the actors in the vignettes--crap happens in real life that simulations cannot account for.    I agree with SarahPhD that you will need to pursue work beyond the bachelors level if you want to enter the field. So a real-time, "live" campus experience for graduate work may be a good complement to a distance learning undergraduate degree in psychology.

AA12193030	The meanings of the suffix "-ble" are the same as that of "-able" and "-ible": "able to" (durable), "capable of being" (drinkable, divisible), "worthy of being" (lovable), "having qualities of" (comfortable), and "tending or inclined to" (peaceable).
AA12193030	Vocabulary is like the bricks of language. Sentence structure is the mortar holding all the vocabulary words together to make a wall. Reading comprehension is knowing what to do with that wall, understanding its purpose.    Vocabulary, sentence structure, and reading comprehension are sequential and build upon each other. To understand a written piece, one must first understand the essential vocabulary of the piece. Then one must understand the sentence structure, or how the words are put together to make different kinds of sentences. Finally, with reading comprehension, one puts all the sentences together to understand the whole passage, which in turn might be done sequentially: first paragraph by paragraph; then chapter by chapter; and finally by putting together the beginning, middle, and end.

AA12193030	The nature of something is that which makes it what it is. The nature of a paragraph is that it is usually made up of a collection of sentences dealing with one topic, such as the uses of fire. One of those sentences may express the main idea of the paragraph, such as "Fire can be very useful." The rest of the sentences are details, such as examples, which support the main idea.
AA11764241	A hemisphere is half a sphere, so you would need to use the volume formula for a sphere to find the volume of the portion above water.    Volume of a Sphere: 4/3(pi)r^3    Now, that formula will give you an entire sphere but you only need half, so when you do the calculation divide your answer by two.    You now have ten percent of the total volume above the water .      To find the total volume, you can either multiply the answer by ten, because 10% is one-tenth of the total volume, or you could use a proportion to solve.  If this is for homework, I would suggest you use the proportion so later you have work to support your answer.  You may not remember later why you chose to multiply by ten.  An answer that makes no sense or leaves no impression is pretty much worthless in mathematics.

FWVQxd7paa	This is long! ........    Employment of children  There are various restrictions to the type of work children can do. Children may not work in places where gambling takes place, where alcohol is consumed or in an environment that may be dangerous to them.    Children between 13 and 16 need a work permit if they are in paid employment.    Children in full time compulsory education must have permits even when they reach 16 until the official school leaving date. This is the last Friday in June.    The hours children can work  After four hours a child must have a minimum of one hour break.    School days  A child may work a maximum of two hours between 7.00am and 7.00pm.    Saturday or during school holidays  A child may work a maximum of five hours a day if they are under 15 and eight hours once 15 or over.    During school holidays  13 and 14 year olds may only work 25 hours a week. 15 and 16 year olds in full time compulsory education may work 35 hours a week.  Again, they may only work between 7.00am and 7.00pm.    Sunday  A child may work a maximum of two hours between 7.00am and 11.00am.  But You will need a permit, this is for your safety and insurance reasons ....  Applying for a permit  Prospective employers are responsible for applying for a permit.    Finally, the employer signs the form to confirm they will abide by the law regarding the child's employment and that they have the appropriate insurance cover.    Employment of children by-laws  Prohibited employment: You CANNOT work;    In any work which is more than three metres above floor level   In a commercial kitchen   As an attendant or assistant in a fairground or amusement arcade or in any premises used for the purpose of public entertainment by means of automatic machines, games of chance or skill or similar devices   To sell or deliver alcohol: except in sealed containers   In a cinema, theatre, discotheque, dance hall or night club (unless licensed to perform there)   To collect or sort refuse   In any slaughterhouse or other premises connected with the killing of livestock   In or in connection with any racing course or track, or other place where any like sport is carried on, or as an assistant in any business conducted therein   In any agricultural work involving heavy strain   In the delivery or sale of fuel oils   As an agent for the collection of money   Employment at any machine prescribed as dangerous in an order made under section 19 of the Offices, Shops and Railways Premises Act 1963, or at any agricultural machine prescribed as dangerous in other relevant acts.  Employers of children working out of doors must ensure that the child has suitable clothes and shoes for protection against bad weather.    No child can be employed for more than four hours continuously without a period of rest lasting at least one hour.         Other than that, get yourself a job! As long as your employer is decent and looks after you, you'll be working in no time. Good Luck :0)|`|559b42146bb2d8a1df4e0df9b8c56031aa	You cant get a proper job until you have a national insurance card when you turn 16 but until then you could get a paper-round or babysit for family-friends or relatives.

a2b85813b3e24e23354f1e1929dda7faaa	L'Invitation au Voyage  ( Baudelaire)         Mon enfant, ma s?ur,       Songe  la douceur       D'aller l-bas vivre ensemble !       Aimer  loisir,       Aimer et mourir       Au pays qui te ressemble !       Les soleils mouills       De ces ciels brouills       Pour mon esprit ont les charmes       Si mystrieux       De tes tra?tres yeux,       Brillant  travers leurs larmes.             L, tout n'est qu'ordre et beaut,       Luxe, calme et volupt.             Des meubles luisants,       Polis par les ans,       Dcoreraient notre chambre ;       Les plus rares fleurs       Mlant leurs odeurs       Aux vagues senteurs de l'ambre,       Les riches plafonds,       Les miroirs profonds,       La splendeur orientale,       Tout y parlerait        l'ame en secret       Sa douce langue natale.             L, tout n'est qu'ordre et beaut,       Luxe, calme et volupt.             Vois sur ces canaux       Dormir ces vaisseaux       Dont l'humeur est vagabonde ;       C'est pour assouvir       Ton moindre dsir       Qu'ils viennent du bout du monde.       - Les soleils couchants       Revtent les champs,       Les canaux, la ville entire,       D'hyacinthe et d'or ;       Le monde s'endort       Dans une chaude lumire.             L, tout n'est qu'ordre et beaut,       Luxe, calme et volupt.    Magnifique hymne  l'amour!.......Rvons ensemble.......|`|Kz6hCeDraa	j'aimais beaucoup cette phrase de baudelaire mais qd j'ai eu explication de texte  l'cole cela m'a surpri et un peu dgout de savoir qu'il parlait de sexe enfin je suppose que c'est le moment aprs le sexe.

Mort, on pourrait se dire ce genre de belle phrase !  bisous|`|kQvZvkyhaa	Je trouve trange -et triste!- de penser l au "sexe" ou  la mort.  Pour  moi, c'est un extraordinaire voyage intrieur, un paysage onirique sorti d'une rverie amoureuse, une vision chaude et lumineuse, mais troublante aussi, trs caracttistique de Baudelaire : splendeur orientale, ciels brouills o point un soleil  qui voque l'clat d'un regard per?u  travers des larmes... et puis les parfums, le thme du bateau, de l'errance interrompue...   Cela en rappelle tant d'autres !  "Chaque fleur svapore ainsi qu'un encensoir"...  "Les sons et les parfums tournent dans l'air du soir,  Valse mlabncolique et langoureux vertige"...  "J'ai longtemps habit sous de vastes portiques  Que les soleils couchants teintaient de mille feux..."  etc, etc!|`|4ngR7Mhzaa	Cela m'inspire un passage d'un pome que j'ai crit :    par la porte entr'ouverte, j'coute un air de vie,  Je rspire un refrain de sant,  La rose du matin me dvopile le secret de la nuit,  Une douce volupt me brule le coeur,  C'est un fatal prsent du ciel,  Un jeu du hasard et des saisons.....|`|kGqgwYGdaa	volupt est utilis souvent pour joie du sexe,mais ici; sa joie c'est l'extase devant cette belle nature,ce bel endroit ,cet ailleur dont il rvait.

jVa0vlnYaa	I was an LSAT tutor and took the the exam myself in 2000. I think the LSAT is one of those exams where the better the test-taker you are, the better you will do.    That said, there are parts of the LSAT that you should devote some study to.  In particular, give attention to the analytical reasoning section.  It is my experience that studying this section really pays off, as there are tips and tricks that will help you manage your time and answer the questions correctly.  Devote some time to this - practice in this area will definitely increase your score.  I wish I had devoted more time to studying this section.    If you're considering law school, and have done well on the GRE and SAT, I would assume your reading skills are pretty good.  In this section of the LSAT, some study of the types of questions can be helpful.  You should also map out a plan of attack.  For some standardized tests, you're taught to read the questions before the essay or excerpt.  In the LSAT, that's a waste of time.  Read the essay first and learn a marking system so that when you read the questions, you can refer back to the essay easily.    I personally find the logical analysis section very easy, but again - it will benefit you to learn the type of questions you will encounter.    Basically, I'd suggest you buy a book (Kaplan or whatever) and take a practice test to see where you sit.  Then devote your time in the order above:  a lot of practice to analytical reasoning, some to reading, and what's left to logic.      For what it's worth, I also do well on standardized tests and I studied embarrassingly little for the LSAT and still scored in the 93rd percentile.      Good luck!|`|vGu6bcR9aa	If you already do well on standardized tests you're probably arleady set to do pretty well on the reading comprehension, essay, and other section.    Practice, practice, practice for the logic portion of the test. That kills a lot of people simply because they aren't used to such linear thought.    Good luck.

The perimeter of the square would would be x+x+x+x or 4x, and the perimeter of the rectangle would be (x+3)+(x+3)+(x+5)+(x+5), or 4x +16.

Then determine which sums of which products equals the middle term.     5 can only be factored as 5 (1)  4 could be: 4 (1)  and 2(2)  it's a trial and error thing-- fortunately, not a lot of different possibilities with those terms.

LXTA56rVaa	Well to get into any CSU or UC system, the basic requirement is to follow the A through G path. Because SF is a CSU, you do not need to take the SAT/ACT if you have an unweighted GPA of 3.0. They still suggest you to take those tests anyways. Meeting the minimum requirements does not mean automatic admissions, but the higher the better. You might also want to join a few clubs and be active in them so your resume to college looks impressive. Hope this will help you! Good luck!

The moral: factor or die! The most interesting math here is in thinking about how they made the movie.     Infinity (1996) ~ this biopic is about Richard Feynman. There's a priceless scene where he has a calculating duel with a guy with an abacus.

Ca50njBhaa	un aborto es una dificil carga con la cual vivir, tienes razon, y esta carga afecta a las personas dependiendo de su caracter, de su educacion, de su cultura, su entorno, simplemente como vivan su vida, no importa si es una muchacha de 15 que lo hizo sin pensarlo o una mujer de 30 que vio todos los pros y contras para tomar su desicion, siempre una accion de esa magnitud tiene un efecto en la vida fisica, espiritual, emocional de una persona, y si tu en algun momento, en medio de una platica o cualquier otra situacion haces un comentario acerca de lo que piensas sobre alguien que ha hecho esto, como dices tu en forma de reproche, tal ves sin pensarlo bien, si, claro que puede lastimar, puede tocar una herida que lo mas seguro es que no este cerrada, y nunca se cierre por completo, pero esta persona esta consciente de ello, y lo mas seguro es que asimilara el comentario y seguira adelante. uno no puede tampoco ir por la vida cuidando cada palabra que sale de nuestra boca, asi que una persona que ha pasado por esto, sabe la desicion que tom y aprenden a manejarle, asi que en resumen, no te preocupes, hay que pensar las cosas antes de decirlas, claro, pero hay que decir todo lo que esta en nuestra mente, espero que de alguna manera sea lo que stavas buscando.|`|zLbkq8nLaa	tienes razon como mucha gente puede vivir con una serenidad que te quedas asustado...    mira esto fue lo que paso... es un relato que supe aki donde yo vivo...

Como decia antes, hay muchos tipos de personas que les afectan las cosas diferente he escuchado de casos de suicido por que se realizaron un aborto, y muchos otros que que llevan mas de uno... Ademas de las que abortaron de forma espontanea y realmente desean un hijo...    No hay un absoluto para las cosas, sin embargo hay tendencias sobre lo que la gente en general decide sentir hacia este tema. Yo en especial no estoy en contra, pero siempre y cuando tengan un motivo justo, eso de pues ahorita no quiero... no lo es, la gente deberia ser mas responsable, la decision de hacerlo legal fue un hit, pero deberia ser acompa?ada de una campa?a de orientacion sexual para evitar llegar a estas consecuencias.|`|79a8bMIlaa	considero que somos seres humanos y como tales nos comportamos, antes de juzgar a otro.  miremos que nadie esta encento cometer un error por insignificante que sea. existen miles de motivos para cometer un error: miedo,desconocimiento, temor a enfrentar, dolor, soberbia,en fin lo que sea. no juzguemos lo que no comprendemos porque nadie tiene la verdad absoluta. el amor es el sentimiento mas hermoso sobre la faz de la tierra y quizs no entendemos su significado. no juzgue y no seras juzgado.|`|bb57352b7f8cdf76bad75d8f4eb4e153aa	Hace 3 a?os que mi mejor amiga abort y hasta ahorita  no tiene ningn remordimiento, pues ella dice que prefiere  haberlo abortado a traerlo a sufrir a este mundo en donde  todo es cansancio.

ePWkvmzoaa	my advice to you is not to delay what you take today to the next day but study your lessons on the same day when it explained to you by your teacher it will be better and its study will be easier and you will not forget..  trust your self and you must feel that you can study and can make very good results but the most important is to concentrate..  Don't forget revision it's very important ..I mean after you had taken the lesson and study it(in the same day) by 3 days make a quick revision to this lesson you will remember it and fix it in your mind.  try to follow what I told to you and you will get good results...  All my good wishes to you..

En maths, il faut te spcialiser.   Si tu fais HEC, aprs tu pourras rentrer dans une grande cole de commerce avec un boulot  la fin en choisissant correctement ton cole.   En mdecine, il faut avoir la vocation car ce que tu vas apprendre est difficile. Pour russir en mdecine, le mieux est de prparer ta premire anne dans une cole spcialis dans cela puis ensuite intgrer la fac.  Et tu n'as pas pens aux tudes de droit pour tre avocat spcialis dans un domaine prcis. Tu aurais mieux de question  te poser.

En maths sup, la slection se fait dj niveau bac... Par consquent, tu te retrouves avec une classe de niveau plus lev qu'au lycee et le rythme devient trs dense. Une 2eme slection s'effectue  la fin de la 2eme anne pdt les concours... c'est 2 ans d'endurance, et aprs t'es relativement tranquille.    Aprs c'est plus dans la dure des tudes qu'il faut voir le truc... Une cole tu es diplom au bout de 5 ans... La mdecine le double.  Par contre, en mdecine, tu bosses en tant qu'interne au bout de  6 ans. Ton salaire varie de 1500  2000 en fonction de ton anne. En gros tu bosses mais t'es encadr (dans d'autres pays les medecins sont diploms plus t?t puis commencent leur carriere en tant que jeune mdecin encadr, au final cela revient au meme, sauf qu'ils n'ont plus leur statut tudiant et ne peuvent afficher un bac+10).  En sortant d'une cole tu bosses un an plus tot avec un salaire moyen de 2000. En gnral tu es aussi encadr au dbut et ton salaire n'est pas trs lev au dpart mais voluera rapidement les 1eres annes.  Donc c'est plus interessant au dpart de faire une cole, mais une fois que le mdecin est diplom son salaire est plus important que celui d'un ingnieur.|`|872af3db11f023eb9f514d04eff4b1f0aa	moi j'ai fait une prapa hec mais si c'tait  refaire je ferais....

Ce n'est pas le cas en mdecine o tu ne fais travailler que ta mmoire.

ew0FaElzaa	When I was in high school (this wasn't too many years ago) out-of-house v.s. in-house was viewed as a vacation. So in-house is definitely a good idea because teenagers hate that more than just being sent home. Being sent home is more of an incentive to get suspended. But I do believe if what they have done is bad enough for the schools safety as well as the students, that the student should be removed from the premicise until further actions have been taken.|`|Q8amh0rUaa	suspension is suspension.

Success in leading reforms to increase student achievement often hinged upon a principal's ability to create a shared vision within the school community and success in implementing new organizational structures that engage teachers in shared decision-making. Principals have discovered that engaging the entire school staff in making decisions results in more commitment to school reform initiatives.<br>  <br>  Principals are also responsible for facilitating their school's interactions with parents and others in the school community. This responsibility includes working with parents when disciplinary issues arise, when students are not succeeding academically, and when parents have concerns. Principals also interact with parents who serve on school advisory boards, parent/teacher organizations, and booster clubs. Principals report that they spent a significant part of their time working with parents of students who have been identified as needing special services through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997 (IDEA).<br>  <br>  Principals continue to be responsible for the management of their schools even though their primary responsibility has shifted. One major management responsibility is school safety. This responsibility includes ensuring that facilities and equipment are safe and in good working order, the development of overall school discipline policies and the enforcement of those policies, and the assignment of supervisory responsibilities among school personnel. At the elementary level, principals are cognizant of their responsibility to ensure constant supervision of the very young children in the school. As students advance into the higher grades, the need for supervision changes as students mature. The responsibility for supervision remains high for older students who are handicapped; who are in areas where the potential for injury is greater such as labs, shops, and athletic facilities; and who are in situations (field trips, athletic events, etc.) where additional caution is required.<br>  <br>  Another name for school principals ... some are called Directors (Area), Coordinators (area); there are all types of principals as Dean.<br>  <br>  Hope this is what your looking for ...

2aa6a351069e388eff62776571ad1ec7aa	Talking about families is often a theme in preschool. Almost always it relates to the personal experiences of the children in the class. IF a gay relationship (two moms, two dads, two grandmas, etc.) are part of a child's life, it can not be ignored and the child can not be made to feel he is a lesser person because of those relationships in his/her life. <br>  <br>  I think it is enough to say that all families are different and include many different people. If a child was to ask why, just saying that "Because Johnny's daddies love each other and want to share their lives and take care of Johnny." is enough. If a child was to ask questions beyond that, I would divert the question to their parents. <br>  <br>  One has to be careful, though, that no one's feeling are hurt and the children accept that families can be very different. It's not okay to tease or make fun of people because their family is different than yours. <br>  <br>  I'd rather it wasn't necessary to address the issue at all in preschool, but when it is a part of their lives, sometimes it does have to be discussed and teachers need to think about how they will handle it and be prepared. <br>  <br>  I once had to explain to my preschoolers about Sally who had a dad and mom at the beginning of the year, but now had two moms (dad was undergoing a sex change and began living as a woman). He, er, she wanted to volunteer in the classroom and had every right to do so even though some parents were upset about it.|`|Wn0nwNFjaa	I do not agree with schools teaching such young children about adult relationships, that is something for the parents to judge when and how their child should learn. I have a 4 year old, she loves Mika and asked me about Billy Brown falling in love with another man, she asked me and wanted to know if it was possible so I just told her that sometimes men love men and women love women. I did not give this a label of GAY because I don't think categorising people is really very helpful. She just accepts that anyone can love anyone. That was my my choice. 4 year olds do not understand adult relationships and they should not be compelled to by the education system.|`|014d65a0c1703f4cec009da9b16a4d9faa	This is part of the HEAD START lessons for the American preschools! This is already here, and if you do not agree then YOU are the one with bias. I DO NOT think we should teach  this. One of the main writers of the book below wrote primarily gay/lesbian books. Her books all pushed the thought that if kids as young as babies are taught in school that 'gay is OK',  then they will be accepting of this as the child gets older. Basically, get them before their parent can impose their bias on the child. So why then, is this the 'Bible' to to speak of teaching anti-bias to preschoolers ????|`|KGRikkJeaa	i have to agree with you. if they are prone to seeing gays in schools as much as in public they should know about it (whether you enforce its right or wrong). It's in our future to see more and more of it, so if we are teaching our children about it , it may not even phase them. My two year old has a gay older brother (31yrsold) who lives with his partner, so I think if they taught this in school he might not even care about his brother being gay, and would rather just love him for who he is...ya know?|`|lOeM1KZ7aa	They are kids for heavens sake !!!<br>  Let then go outside and play and have a good time while they are still innocent little creatures.<br>  Why on earth do we have to fill their young minds with such complicated rubbish, no wonder kids grow up totally confused.<br>  Adults are just screwing up young kids brains and trying to turn them into mini adults.|`|4786d32b584fcb26c69f4fab5c440db6aa	Can you imagine the problems you will have explaining that Noddy and Big Ears are not in a gay relationship.|`|MQVmh5hiaa	They shouldn't know about that until they are old enough to understand.

I think by teaching them about it, it is in someway saying its wrong as the person feels a need for it to be teached.<br>  <br>  Saying that I think kids should know there is different types of families, some with a mommy and daddy, some with two mommies or two daddies, whatever because it will cut down on bullying and prejudice if it is normal to do them.|`|ntNQAnPDaa	It depends on the context.  At the age of 4, children don't need to know much about romantic relationships, but if they ask, the topic shouldn't be avoided.  I certainly don't think it's bad to explain to them that families and relationships sometimes involve a man and a man or a woman and a woman together.  <br>  <br>  I am straight and happily married and am raising my son to be very loving and tolerant of gay people. I won't tolerate any gay-bashing in my house, EVER.|`|QMWlOSXraa	I think this is awful!<br>  Why is society trying to force such young children to learn about these things and grow up so early!!<br>  When I was that age I'm pretty sure I would never have cared or understood what was being said! <br>  Children at this age don't judge anyone unless parents or carers have drummed something into them.<br>  When I was at school, one of my teachers was a dwarf, no-one ever laughed at her, judged her or anything. Children don't mind people who are different!<br>  When they reach they age of about 9-10, they will probably start to wonder and ask questions so I think they should leave it until about then to explain anything to them!|`|rJgrwIodaa	I think it should be up to the parents.  Any talk about relationships should be kept at home, not in schools.  Why can't public schools teach things kids actually need to know?  Science, math, grammar, social studies...So many people don't know a damn thing about any of those.  I'd like to see kids graduate high school knowing how to spell words like "really" and be able to punctuate sentences.  I couldn't give a flying **** what they know about relationships.  That's what their teen years are for, and trust me, they'll even spend too much time thinking about it then.|`|CKUDYUfEaa	i totally agree there is no right or rong answer all thow there is a time and a place n at 4 yr old in priamry schoool isnt it mby as they get to the ages of 8 and they are impresionallable threw peer presser ect. to this really regardless weather they are gay or not personally am no gay but they seem to stick to there own i knwo a fella whos trying to foster some kids but his gay and having troubel or was not sure about it now he has a secure job nice house good morals and just has never been able to have them coz of his sexuwallty but dont make him a bad parent figure sorry aout the spelling|`|AMI8oQMDaa	It's a bit young to be explaining any form of relationship. However, maybe by opening the topic up at a younger age, they are hoping to stim the prejudice. Of course, 4-year-olds might have a difficult time understanding it.|`|8LZuzkXgaa	Clearly you don't have, nor have had, a 4 year old.  At 4 kids are learning colors, how to share, how to play with other kids.  Can't we let kids be kids without rushing to indoctrinate them into an immoral system.|`|6mOOskuBaa	A few 4 year olds might have some idea about sexual identity, but not many. I'd just leave it alone unless the child asks a specific question. It will come up later.|`|WPd4MYt6aa	I don't see how 4 year olds are really going to understand much about that. They are just going to see and think that its okay for 2 men to be together or 2 women to be together.|`|RYCBDqDsaa	children at the age of 4 arent even old enough to realize the difference. yeah its wrong cause their not even going to pay any attention to what the teachers are trying to teach them|`|bQfwwUYhaa	OMG stuff like these are destroying america, they teach little schoolgirls how to use a condom instead of what it means being in a relationship!!! America is truly the new sodom and will be doomed!|`|w2pxYjJVaa	They shouldn't be talking about any relationship at all. At 4 years old they are going to get confused. It's just to young to talk about it, gay or straight.|`|0cbbecbdc82615f79e12b103dd58a90caa	the question is more about the age its being taught.. what happened to innocence? Its political correctness gone mad.|`|zsiy7Whnaa	i think its wrong to teach them that they cannot make up there own minds at that age and if people dont like being gay then why dont they go for the opposite sex geesh i hate stuff like this :@|`|tkLm7t6haa	I don't really think preschoolers need to know about it.|`|0ItuBXtpaa	I agree with all the above...<br>  <br>  These are issues that should be discussed  when the children are old enough to understand|`|YtJ3yf3Iaa	thats a bit strong, especially for a 4 year old<br>  <br>  hows about just let them figure it out themselves, but make them aware of people being gay, and that its not a bad thing|`|AA11569882	I don't think it's necessary.  I mean, sure, you can say "some people have a mummy and a daddy, and some people have two mummies or two daddies, and some people live with just their mummy or just their daddy" but beyond that isn't really needed.  Not for a four year old!  <br>  <br>  I do think it's best to be completly open from an early age so they would never grow up thinking some things are wierd, but there is no need to actually go into a whole lesson all about gay relationships because the kids just wouldn't understand.|`|jipqICzVaa	They don't need to know anything about gay relationships at this age.|`|4ab2ea36c0069d71d94055356c32ea00aa	It has to be put into the proper context...in terms of how families are different.  Children do understand relationships, despite what is said.  They understand that there are mothers and fathers and you can teach them that some children have 2 mothers or 2 fathers, even though most of us have both a mother and a father.  Some people live with their grandparents, some people live with only one parent, some people live with...whatever.  The main point you want to bring across is that, even with different relationships of guardians, these people are still a family and they love each other very much.|`|XZlFLecLaa	i think 4 year olds are too young to understand relationships of any kind ... let alone have them explained to them... 4 year olds dont understand nr do they care! <br>  <br>  they just want their nap time a blankie and some  candy!|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	well at 4 yrs old it is young but you know what if this is needed to teach kids that they need to respect others ,well then maybe they should do it|`|HUhheZWtaa	Too Young !
4ybzs1Knaa	You are stating you are a good student.   Question is what do you wan to do?  What perks your interest?  Be it while reading, watching television, or a conversation.  Having  good grades, is a general statement.  Any subjects strike your interest to read more about the subject? <br>  <br>  Best suggestion is speak to the school counselor for guidance.|`|vyVDWIehaa	You're a good student, huh?  Shouldn't you be in class right now instead of asking this question in the middle of the school day?
AA10176626	Lisa:<br>  <br>  The FAFSA is not a check, it's a financial aid application. Completing the FAFSA makes you eligible for several different types of aid, ranging from loans to grants. The effect of withdrawing from school depends on what specific form(s) of aid you are receiving.<br>  <br>  If your aid award consisted mostly, or entirely, of a Stafford loan, there is absolutely no effect of withdrawing from school. Well, other than having to pay 10 years of accumulating interest on courses that you never finished or earned a grade for.<br>  <br>  If your award included a Pell Grant, then, yes, you have a significant potential problem, in that you might be required to pay back a good portion of the Pell Grant money.<br>  <br>  Even after a Pell Grant has been disbursed, it's not really yours. You have to spend the rest of the semester "earning" it. You earn a Pell Grant by completing the course work - you don't even have to pass the classes, but you have to attend them. Be careful - if you fail a course because you just stop attending, your school will still consider your Pell Grant unearned. It's not when you file your withdrawal paperwork - it's when you stop going to class that counts.<br>  <br>  A Pell Grant recipient who drops one or more courses before completing 60% of the grading period has failed to "earn" his/her Pell Grant, and the government requires that any unearned Pell Grants be returned to the Department of Education.<br>  <br>  Your school is required to turn the money back, and they must bill you for whatever Pell Grant funds they were required to return. Here's why that matters:<br>  <br>  Owing the school for unearned Pell Grant funds is known as a financial aid overpayment. Students who have financial aid overpayments MUST pay those overpayments back before they can qualify for any further financial aid. You must either pay the school in full, or arrange a payment agreement - and begin honoring that payment agreement by making actual payments. Note that you can not "get" financial aid to pay back your overpayment - that money must come out of your own pocket, somehow.<br>  <br>  Students who receive financial aid are required to visit the aid department before dropping courses, and especially before dropping out of school. The financial aid department will calculate how much you are required to pay back, and will negotiate an arrangement for you to make those payments. Make an appointment with financial aid before you complete any drop or withdrawal paperwork.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind something else - that other students have wondered about in the past. The federal government tracks all federal student aid in a large database known as the NSLDS (National Student Loan Data System). If you go to another school, and apply for aid, the Department of Education will review your financial aid history, and will notify your new school of any blocks on your aid eligibility. If you owe School A, you must pay off that debt before you can qualify for financial aid at School B.<br>  <br>  Good luck - I hope this information helps.

You are never fully prepared when they come, they come and then your whole life changes.  I am a 36 yr old mother of two, a nine year old and a 9 month old baby.  You can still go to school and have a baby, why not, I've known people who have done it, it's totally doable.  You should call your health insurance company and find out if you will be covered for maternity and hospital expenses.  Talk to someone at the school and see if your funding will continue if you take maternity leave you can always come back when you are ready.

Anyway...Another suggestion... it's almost Spring...watch for those neighborhood garage/yard sales!  We also have something called Freecycle for our county.  You can check your county as well.  People post items and ask for items...everything must be free.  Just helps keep things out of the "junk".  The public library often does a book sale at least once a year.  A wonderful way to add to your collection at .25-1.00 a book.<br>  <br>  Another word of advice...it might be good to suck up the expense and purchase new.  I found this was the best way to go for me.  That way I could set the standing on how the items were going to be treated because they looked new and we wanted to keep them that way.  www.discountschoolsupply.com is very reasonable in their prices and they stand behind their products.<br>  <br>  Also, my husband and I decided to apply for an Amazon.com credit card that is paid off every month and the reward is a $25 gift certificate for every 2500 points.  Not hard to wrack up those points and I used the certificate for child care items.  It's amazing what they have available.  Free shipping over $25 as well for products sold by Amazon.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|QMWlOSXraa	Get onto eBay, you can get stuff at great bargain prices.<br>  Also go to charity shops, you will be surprised at what you find!<br>  As long as you sterilise all these things before giving them to a child to save possible infections.<br>  Good luck with yours nursery!<br>  Hope I helped!! =)
