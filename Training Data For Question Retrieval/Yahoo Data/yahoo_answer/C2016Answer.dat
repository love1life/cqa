AA10594501	Only the Series 3 TiVo units, like the TiVo HD can stream Netflix. And yes, you will have to continue to pay the TiVo subscription. You can drop it down to a little more than $10 per month if you prepay one year's worth at $129.<br>  <br>  You should also have a broadband connection that can sustain at least 3 mbits/sec. Mine does about 5 mbits/sec and it looks very good with my TiVo HD. However, the streaming movies are only standard definition.

9oMXpS05aa	you shouldn't be downloading free music. you're ripping off TONS of individuals that worked hard to provide you with your entertainment. download a program that requires you to pay for your music so that the music industry doesn't suffer for your piracy. <br>  i like iTunes. you can preview any song before you download it and the music there is cheaper than purchasing an album at a retail store.|`|RXtiPBNjaa	Great website and it's easy to use.

22ojjhZhaa	the best thing to do is when you first plug in the ipod, on the home screen there is a button that says manually manage music or something like that.  thats a good thing to always have on because sync is unreliable and then you can drag specific music to your ipod much easier than sync-ing the entire thing.|`|bfx2ypVKaa	girlsing tec r stupid at us
22ojjhZhaa	yeah it stays on in the locked mode.  i've never turned mine completely off. its similar to the regular ipod because once you hit a button, its on. its like standby mode or sleep for macs.|`|bfx2ypVKaa	up 2 u|`|byntxJkZaa	I havnt really own an iPhone but I do own a second generation iPod touch. Well for me, I wake up in the morning and walk to the bus stop and listen to a couple of songs. Sometimes I just play the games with my friends on the bus.  Once I get to school I use their wifi to get on myspace or etc. As soon as the first bell ring I put it on sleep and focus on my work. After that I go home and just get on the Internet there too. So basically you can actually go around with your iPod touch.

VJ1C5JsYaa	Nope sorry. Currently there is no way to use another controller on the Xbox 360.|`|8146e347ad7537c819ea87c18358a194aa	No i dont think its possible. i would search google for an online retailer that may have a original xbox to usb, or ps2 to usb that would be the only way.
FnxswaoPaa	You can only have up to 9 pages of apps on the ipod touch sorry.|`|AA11525080	Yes , you are restricted to 9 pages. To get around this I jailbroke mine and used an app called Categories to add more apps.|`|hCqJMe9xaa	144 apps isn't enough for you? Seriously. That's alot of apps

117ba8dee6d7175b6b3f5e2480ad6007aa	The Bose ones that block out noise.

I was just looking on google for the worlds most expensive headphones. And it's crazy how much they are but of course its so expensive because they dip them in gold and put diamonds on it. I wouldn't even want to buy them cuz i'd be afraid of loosing them.|`|LP4P5wosaa	Blue jays or blue birds (i forget which is the name) by skull candy, they are wireless and the quality is great but they cost like $156.00 (USA currency.)|`|SpKV9zcYaa	The bose Stereo ones the sound is great. my friend lent me them they cost like 100$.

It seems like Apple releases new generation iPods at the holiday season (around September). If you are hell bent on getting the **newest** iPod Touch, then wait till at least November, if it has not been released, then it either wont be, or there will at least be more information on it. <br>  <br>  Good luck.

T4WQYqC4aa	You seem to have a good taste in games. Super Mario Galaxy has been extremely well-received by critics, although I personally find it a bit overrated. If you liked Mario 64 or Mario Sunshine, you will probably love Galaxy.<br>  <br>  Besides that game, Metroid Prime 3 seems to be really popular as well, and Okami was also well-received, in case you haven't played the PS2 version.<br>  <br>  If you've already played all of that or have no interest in any of them, you might also want to try No More Heroes, or Resident Evil 4 Wii if you haven't played the GameCube version yet.|`|b2ZwhOqsaa	mario party even tho its kinda expensive, try and find a used one to get it a little cheaper.  its lots of fun|`|5HfuI3MEaa	there are so many good games, google a list.|`|o8NVWaJgaa	One Piece Unlimited Adventure if you're a Once Piece fan like me and like an adventure game/fighting game.

Put your two 360s within reach of an ethernet cable and put it in the port of both of them, linking them directly. If you're playing system link there should be an option for that assuming the game is compatible. There should also be an option for hosting or joining.

After this time it will revert back to a Silver membership if you do not wish to pay for the Gold service.

To do this in real-time, you will probably need ASIO drivers. The USB interface mfg should provide them, otherwise you will need to download the ASIO4ALL software.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Saul

457100fed3620574b42ee7b208682b1faa	well, for example in NYC each central office serves at least 5 diffrent exchanges.... in more rural areas a central office might only serve a single exchange... <br>  <br>  local calling areas are determined by the distance that the call has to travel, and any tariffs or fees that the telephone company might have to pay to other companies to connect the call... many times in-state long distance, or regional calls cost more than out of state long distance calls... one of the mysteries of the telephone network.....|`|4G41Z3RJaa	Usually the Telco's are allowed to base the amount that they charge for residential or business services on the number of telephone numbers that you could call without toll charges.  As well local telephone service cost the company as much or more than the revenue generated.  That took into account the relatively low cost to provide telephone service in high density areas and the very high cost to provide telephone service in low density rural areas.  As well the revenue for long distance service cost the companies in the neighborhood of 10% of the revenue.  That took into account the relatively low revenue for long distance calls near your calling area, and the relatively high revenue for long distance calls over longer distances.  So the incentive is for the Telco is to maximize the long distance calls to other countries or distance states, while maximizing the number of telephones that the local calling area covered. To prevent misuse by the Telcos the government agencies that regulated the business made it more difficult for the Telcos to add exchanges to the local calling area.  So they were required to check with the areas and poll customers to see if a majority of customers wanted to add the larger calling area.<br>  <br>  So the answer is government regulation and Telco's attempts to maximize profits.  I know areas where calling across the street is a long distance call, but the one of those people may be able to call the next town or city without charge.

IIB5Ldc4aa	Over charging a battery does lessens the life of the battery. ?|`|panG3MKcaa	Rechargeable batteries of any kind inevitably lose their ability to hold a charge.  This can happen quickly with poor battery care or happen over a long period of time with proper battery care.  Charging your Ipod every night while you sleep prevents the battery from discharging all of its stored energy.  As a result, over time, the battery (figuratively) 'forgets' that it still has half a charge left, and available voltage drops way earlier than it should.  Your Ipod shuts itself off at a specific voltage to prevent hardware/battery damage.  You may be able to revive some of the lost battery life with proper care.<br>  <br>  I don't own an Ipod, but I imagine the battery charging system is similar to that of a cell phone or handheld gaming console.  The reason I'm mentioning this is because, to decrease charge time, the manufacturers try to push the maximum amount of current into the battery in as short a time as possible.  This is hard on rechargeable batteries. To offset this, you can try leaving the device on and playing music, with the volume down, as you charge it (but charge it all the way).  This may reduce the current being supplied to the battery, and 'trickle charge' it.  It may also take longer to charge, but I don't think it'll take so long to charge that it won't be done when you wake up.  You may be able to find a charger for it that pushes less amperes into the battery at once.  I don't know, but you could try a USB charging system for it, of course, make sure you're aware of the DC out mA, and strive for one with as little mA as possible.<br>  <br>  Another thing, and this is the most important. Make sure you completely discharge the battery before charging it again as often as possible.  (Run the Ipod until it dies.) Yeah, it's a pain in the butt to carry around an Ipod with only about 10 minutes of battery life left, but it's these 10 minutes that make the difference.   This is where your battery is starting to substantially drop its voltage, and you can 'condition' the battery to sustain optimum voltage as long as possible by forcing it to discharge all available current as often as you can.<br>  <br>  ...but no, it's not your Ipod, it's not your peripherals.  It's the battery.  If you decide to get a replacement, make sure you FULLY charge the battery and FULLY discharge it every time you use it for like the first 10 cycles.  After that, make sure you condition the battery as often as you can.   Good battery care will prevent damage to your electronics, and sustain optimum battery life for the lifetime of the device.|`|znxbqEv1aa	after a while ipods start to lose their battery life...especially the old first generation ones!<br>  you cant do anything...if you still have a warranty you might be able to get a new one...

qWicVoU9aa	When your contract is up you can "port" your number to any carrier you want.  All you have to do is take a copy of a current bill and walk in to an AT&T store and tell them you would like to port your number to them and they will get the ball rolling.  Your Mom will just have to go back to an individual paln if it was just the 2 of you on a family plan and then you will go on an individual plan with AT&T|`|z88IMXNFaa	Sure, you can.  The problem is whether Verizon will still bill you for the Family plan.  I think this is going to depend on the contract your mother signed when she ot her new phone.  She may have signed you up for another 2 years with Verizon and you may have to pay the termination fee to get out of it.

I own a iPod Touch 2G, and I love it. It looks 100x better then the first gen, it's thinner, and lighter, more oval, less rectangular, has a external speaker (1G does not) and a button on the side to quickly turn sound up or down (1G does not have this feature either).<br>  <br>  More apps are compatible with the 2G then there are with the 1G. The only thing that I think sucks about the 2G, is with the Jailbreak, you cannot restart the iPod without having it connected to a computer. Fortunately, I never restart my iPod anyways, so that really does not affect me.<br>  <br>  As for the 3G, yes, there will probably one released for the 09 holiday season (don't quote me on that though). Apple tends to release the new generation iPods every holiday so it's a good chance we will see a new Touch.

Dso7k3sjaa	People are pulling your leg.  There aren't any mermaids in any of the sims 2 games.  You can find mermaid skins for your sims at Insiminator.org but I am not sure where as I've never wanted them.  If you do a search on this site though, I've seen links given that take you to the skins.  But even if you do get the skins and install them, your sims still cannot live underwater.

qWicVoU9aa	Buying the iPhone and then cancelling the service will NOT work as Apple and AT&T already thought of that and the device has to be returned before the contract can be cancelled so you will be paying $175 for having absolutely nothing to show for it.  Yee hah|`|z88IMXNFaa	The iPhone is not compatible with the Verizon network.  If jailbroken, it can be used on the T-Mobile network and some regional networks.<br>  <br>  BTW, to get the iPhone for $200, you have to sign a 2 year contract with AT&T.  While you can then cancel the contract, it will cost you an additional $175.  So the phone will cost you $375 which is less than the phones on eBay but a lot more than the $200 you mention.
AA10959572	Depends on the features that you want.<br>  <br>  But I never recommend iPods.<br>  <br>  If you wonder why... <br>  <br>  1) they are a lot cheaper than what people believe them to be.  Quality wise (including sound) is mediocre at best.<br>  <br>  2) iTunes is a vile software that messes computers up<br>  <br>  3) Just look in Yahoo answer, you'll notice that over 90% of problems are about iPods.<br>  <br>  The list could be longer, but these should be enough...|`|qp9I8NT9aa	An iPod is a line of of MP3 players created by Apple.

3YOOTokraa	Just go to the store where you got the phone! Talk to them, the people who sold you the phone. You can only chnage the number through your phone service|`|Cfja6h4Kaa	To change your number, you probably need to start a whole new account. Go to the store, and they can probably set you up with a new SIM card. It's very possible that you will lose all your pre-paid minutes, so wait until you're really low to do it. Maybe the store has a number you can call rather then going all the way down there.|`|PvpCU2Bdaa	You would have to contact to the network of your phone, ATT, Verizon, Sprint, etc. Radio Shack is simply in the middle of you and the networks and only sell the phones, not the service.|`|dasxXdC3aa	Ya go to the store you bought the phone (if you got it at walmart forget it) but yah someone will walk you through everything you want to know. Good Luck!|`|OsnCPSsoaa	Radio shack wont do it.  They are not able to.  MAYBE an att store can help you but I doubt it.  Your best bet is calling att by dialing 611.  You should be able to get a real person by going through the voice prompts.|`|8gYGNnNzaa	yeah i would think you have to go to the place you got your phone from if costumer service will not help. it might cost extra though.
WfC3sDTHaa	the answer is no, verizon doesnt use sim cards anyway. they operate on CDMA which doesnt use sim cards and at&t operates on GSM which does.|`|z88IMXNFaa	If you read the text of that link, it specifically says that the card will not work in the US.  The iPhone doesn't work with Verizon.  It will work with T-Mobile if jailbroken.|`|wjA9ytO0aa	its not a verizon phone so probably not|`|AuvLNaaTaa	no you cant buy a verizon sim card online<br>  <br>  it will not work
yT6Mezweaa	What about it???<br>  <br>  If you asking what it is, it means to hack or unlock your iPod. It is legal but it does void your warranty.<br>  <br>  Well I couldn't find the video but this is the same guy who showed me how to do it. Pretty straight forward.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrYafP8sNJ0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrYafP8sN...</a><br>  <br>  Oh, and I can't promise it will work, 1.1.4 is a pretty old firmware from like 8 months ago so there is only older videos to get it done.
tlBBwNwTaa	Most likely no. The new Ipod Touch has been quite successful and shouldn't be seeing any changes anytime soon. You are probably safe for 1-2 years before a new one comes out, but Christmas time almost definitely bring a new ipod model.

AA10959572	It all depends on the file format and quality you use, and the length of the songs.<br>  <br>  Simply do the math.<br>  <br>  A song = about 3-4Mb<br>  <br>  A cd = 700Mb  = 100-200 songs<br>  <br>  A DVD = 4.7Gb = more or less 1000-1500 songs.<br>  <br>  Honestly, the best thing I've found is a SD/USB card player  that works over the radio.  No need to burn any disk, just bring the card/Jump drive to your computer and reload it with new music.  Or just get a few of them (you can get 2Gb SD cards for under 10$ easily)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.factorydirect.ca/catalog/product_spec.php?pcode=FM2000" rel="nofollow">http://www.factorydirect.ca/catalog/prod...</a><br>  <br>  They are great little machines... and for 20$ (or so) they are well worth double the price....  I didn't think much of the remote at first, but now, I use it constantly... no more reaching to the radio to skip or replay a song.|`|AA10179458	As long as the DVD player supports MP3 playback, then yes. You would get about 2000 songs.
lwJb9NUEaa	You can either look for a PC recycling place they have all different names. The one near me is called Computer Renaissance. You can also go to some name brand websites and look up their refurbished items that were sent back because they didn't work, were fixed up so they worked, and are being re-sold at a lower price because "no one wants something someone else has touched!"<br>  <br>  That's your best bet really.<br>  <br>  Also try Craig's List for your area and see if anyone is selling a cheap one. <br>  <br>  My buddy is dirt poor and she managed to find a decent one that she could afford on there.|`|oojO4WAraa	In my city we have a store called PC Recyclers.

qWicVoU9aa	If it has been over 30 days you cannot exchange it at a store, you have to call the Warranty Dept at 1-800-801-1101 from a different phone.  The charging issue had absolutely nothing to do with the device being pulled from the shelves as this has been found to be user error and they are forcing the charging plug into the device backwards and thereby shorting out the battery.  The proper procedure for charging the device is to have the screen on the device facing up and the embossed arrow on the charging plug should also be facing up and pointing towrds the device as you plug it in|`|yFvepTAgaa	you get a free exchange for a samsung propel or pantech matrix, idk if you can get anything else but certain stores have different rules

d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	1.  At this point, the answer is yes.  Still, just make sure it's says HDTV when buying it.<br>  <br>  2.  Standard Definition generally looks a little worse on HDTVs then on regular TVs.  Standard definition TVs were made to display that natively.  On an HDTV, there's a conversion that needs to be made, and like most times when images are converted, a little detail is lost or distorted.<br>  <br>  3.  No.  A standard definition channel won't necessarily show up in HD because you now have an HDTV.  It very well might, and many/most do.  But no guarantees about all.<br>  <br>  4.  HD channels look great on HDTVs.  No blurring.  That's what the whole change to HD is all about.<br>  <br>  5.  Don't know.<br>  <br>  6.  Don't know.<br>  <br>  7. It's because of poor store video feed.  A TV will only show as good a picture as the signal it receives.<br>  <br>  8. If it's 40" or over, I'd like for 1080p resolution.  Also, 120Hz will help eliminate motion blur for fast action scenes.  The March 2009 issue of Consumer Reports did a great job evaluating TVs and answering questions.  Pick up a copy to avoid buying the wrong TV.<br>  <br>  Is there any reason you are ruling out Plasma?  Plasma has many benefits (and some drawbacks) that LCDs don't have.|`|dqzoEw67aa	1. yes<br>  2. yes Sd looks bad on HD, there are no SD lcds.<br>  3. not all channels are HD.  Some are still SD.<br>  4.  HD channels, with a good HD cable/Sat. feed will not blur.  A highly compressed signal from some cable companies can blur with fast action.<br>  5.  Game systems look good on HD.  There are no SD LCDs.<br>  6.  If you connect your game system with an HDMI cable, it will look good on an HD tv.<br>  7.  To get best HD results, get an HD cable or sat. box, and connect with either component (red/green/blue) cables or HDMI.  Other cables do not carry HD and will not look good.<br>  8. Get a Samsung 1080p with 120Hz.  Currently their A650 line and up.  New ones are coming out in three weeks. Waiting will provide more choices including led lcds in addition to the current flourescent lcds.|`|usIma0vIaa	1)Yes<br>  2)depends on what type of TV you have.<br>  3)yes<br>  4)no<br>  5)worse play it on HD LCD<br>  6)same<br>  7)adjust sharpness in picture.<br>  8)none<br>  ehow.com|`|RyvKws7Laa	1) Yes.  You technically might be able to find some really small ones that are not, but it would be harder to find an SD set than an HD set by a long shot.<br>  <br>  2) It will depend on the show you are watching.  LCDs tend to be reasonably sharp for SD.  But that depends on the source.  If the show is being broadcast as 4:3 and you stretch it out on a 16:9 set its going to degrade in some fashion or another.  But if its 16:9 SD, then TVs that review/rate well in SD playback will do a decent playback job for you.<br>  <br>  3) No.  Not all broadcasters are broadcasting in HD yet.  Many are, but not 100%.  And most will have HD and SD channels of their network.  Often you have to subscribe to a package of some sort to get the HD channels.<br>  <br>  4) HD channels will come out crisp and clean.  But they are at the mercy of what the broadcaster and local provide send to you.  So if the broadcaster uses short cuts it might not be as good as other HD.  If the local provider (your cable/sat company) do cheats/shortcuts/dumb stuff then again the image might not be as good as it should be.  Also the physical wires feeding your house can impact it (if they are really old and outdated).<br>  <br>  5) Will vary from game to game.  Mostly I think it will look a bit worse on the HDTV.  Much like TV, if the game was designed 4:3 then playing it out on 16:9 HD LCD will likely have some degradation.  If the game was designed 16:9 it should be okay.<br>  <br>  6) Again depends on the games.  When the 360 first came out there were tones of tests looking at this.  And it was different for each game.  But overall I think you're looking at a superior playback.<br>  <br>  7) Its not necessarily the TV, its what you're feeding the TV.  If they are all being fed the same and some look blurry, then they might just be bad TVs.  Not all TVs are created equal.  Some actually don't have great picture quality.<br>  <br>  8) 37" or smaller and there's not a tone you have to worry about.  Most of the fancy specs that marketing people like to advertise impact TVs of larger sizes.  At 37" or smaller my concern is to go with a good brand that will give me a good panel and image processor so the picture quality is good.  I would stick with Panasonic, Samsung, and Sony in this range.  Samsung is the LCD top dog, but in the smaller sets there are some top notch ones from Sony and Panasonic too.<br>  <br>  At 42" and above you want to start worrying about 1080p and Refresh rate.  You will start to see the advantages of better specs in TVs this size.  Or if you're going with a smaller TV but plan to sit really close to the TV (like 4ft or closer), then you might also want to consider these specs.  For the refresh rate, bigger is better. 120Hz would be good, 240Hz would be great.  But there is a heavy price premium for these.  So again, maybe at 37" if you're sitting close I might look at it, but otherwise, you're not as likely to notice the advantages.<br>  <br>  At 37" I would look hard at Panasonic TC-37LZ85.  If that's too pricey, then go down a size.  At 32" I would look at Samsung LN32A550 or PAnasonic TC32LZ800.  Also consider the Sony Bravia KDL-32L4000 (a fair bit cheaper).  If you still need to drop down some in price, then go one more step down in size.  At 26" look at the Panasonic TC-26LX85 or Sony Bravia KDL-26M4000.

jzexF3E3aa	To be honest, it's if microsoft wants to. I got suspended and id even know how. All I know is they can if they want to, and it sucks royal dick. Trust me. If u put ur gt anywere and it mentions anything bad or comment bout microsoft, cheating, hacking, they can ban u, and the sad thing is they are hacking ur ****. so dont be suprised if u get banned, cuz they can do w/e the hell they want to u.<br>  <br>   Microsoft has been disappointing lots of ppl lately, and if they didnt have the features, they wouldnt have 1/8 of the ppl they do. I recommend not putting ur gt anywere if ur trying to get ms points, live for longer, or gt change, cuz if anyone tell or if microsoft sees it, ull most likely be banned. also if u did anything like that delete it ASAP!!!<br>  or ull be ******. <br>  my halo disk got scratched a while back, and u cant sue xbox wen there faulty system did it, and ur supplyer won't exchange it cuz xbox caused it.. so just be ready for anything.<br>   Read my question on my profile and it says what happened to me.|`|TDgjQcvoaa	Using Strong Language, Sexual Harassment, Or Using  A Modded controller. and there are many other things that can get you suspended off of xbox live.|`|Ev3DzQHLaa	modded Console glitching(people be sending Microsoft  videos of people glitching all the time) Racist/threatening actions/harassment<br>  and it also depends on how many people Filed a Complaint on you.<br>  <br>  filed complaints take longer than video evidence.<br>  <br>  so be careful.|`|AqFxXB0Oaa	If you use a modded controller or xbox, offensive language, any other things like that.

Getting a torrent game will get you banned because PB has detected certain files and auto bans once it detects it.<br>  <br>  cod4 is 29 bucks, cod5 will be soon also... buy them, cheap or not.  buying it and not pirating it helps keep the costs down.

Unless you are receiving harassing phone calls and then the charge is waived|`|OsnCPSsoaa	If you are switching from another carrier you have the option to keep your current number.

You will also have to google how to convert mp3 into ringtones.<br>  <br>  by the way, do you remember One Missed Call, zedge.net has that ringtone, the full version of it.

And not only that but everyone has it. The voyager is durable because my cousin takes it with her when she rides her quad and rhino and stuff and it has never broken, just get a screen protector on it so you wont scratch it.

qWicVoU9aa	As of yesterday there was no recall on the device from the manufacturer.  AT&T decided to stop selling it as it failed to meet minimum performance standards.  It had nothing to do with reports of the battery overheating doing charging.  It has been found that this problem is actually caused by the user incorrectly inserting (and forcing) the charging plug into the device backwards.  The plug should only be inserted into the device with the screen of the device facing up and the embossed arrow on the plug should be facing up.|`|OsnCPSsoaa	There have been several problems with the quickfire and people kept returning them and stopped buying them.  It is not a good phone and does not last very long and there are so many problems that it often turns out to be a nightmare.  ATT Removed this phone because they don't want their customers to be unhappy with their service and also when the phones keep braking and people bring them back they do not make any money.  I hope this helps!  If you have any other questions please e-mail me.|`|DnpG1jNZaa	There were reports of the battery bursting into flame when the charger plug was inserted incorrectly. AT&T has suspended all shipping and selling of the Quickfire until further notice I believe.|`|LJTSpOd4aa	cause if you charge it incorrectly it can burst on fire so att took it off the market so they people dont press any charges and crap. i have that phone and its not that great. i recomend the iPhone|`|T6g8O3VNaa	they have been recalled because of so many faults.
XFZmAMOAaa	Why yes they can.Also provides a record.Thats what it's for.|`|wUwQ1lzXaa	A regular GPS doesn't send information, so they cannot track him in real time. Some GPS models keep a "track log" so at the end of the day they can review the data and see where he has been (assuming he doesn't reset the data before giving back the GPS).<br>  <br>  They do sell real-time tracking devices that are often used by trucking companies or delivery fleets, but those systems are more advanced than the usual consumer GPS.|`|F5fIBGCraa	Garmin GPS is just a receiver, not a transmitter.  Since cell phones are both transmitter and receiver, some of them can be tracked by GPS while powered up.<br>  <br>  But the basic direction mapping GPS units cannot be tracked.|`|cv0jDjwaaa	I say the answer is generally no but I also think it depends on the unit. <br>  www.basecampgps.com

What I did to remedy that was to quickly score a goal in the arena and then upload it.

ApZ0qS88aa	The 360 has never had a product recall. (Though perhaps at some point it should have) Current revision 360s are largely reliable and if yours was bought within the last month or so there's a good chance it uses the Jasper chipset which is supposed to significantly reduce the failure rate even below that of the Falcon chipset which replaced the RRoD plagued Xenon and Zephyr chipsets.
zgw1CbVDaa	There aren't any.  The only way to get ringback tones is to purchase them from your provider(if they offer the service) and pay for the service.  Ringback tones are not downloaded to your phone like ringtones are.

AA10389562	Wayyyyy back when phones had real dials on them and no push buttons, phone numbers referenced the first two letters of a word representing a telephone exchange.<br>  <br>  When someone was asked their phone number, they would say something like;<br>  <br>  ORchard 8-2335 where the OR would represent the numbers 67 corresponding to how they are assigned on the dial.|`|zopegiT4aa	It's been around since the beginning of the 20th century (WAY BEFORE TEXTING). Europe and the US used to use the letters are part of their phone system. They would use the first 3 letters of a city, and then end with 4 numbers. Also known as 3L-4N. US then switched over to 2L - 4N. All number calling as we know it did not become universal until the 1980's. The US now uses it mainly to help remember phone numbers. like 1-800-YAHOOOO|`|xFQY4meNaa	These letters have had several auxiliary uses. Originally, they referred to exchanges. In the US in the mid-20th century, numbers were seven digits long including a two-digit prefix, the latter expressed as letters rather than numbers. In the UK telephone numbering system, a similar two-letter code was added after the initial zero to form the first part of the subscriber trunk dialling code for that region - for example, Aylesbury was assigned 0AY6 which translated into 0296. (The majority of these original numbers have remained, particularly in the rural areas. The modern equivalent of 0AY6, namely 01296, still refers to Aylesbury.)<br>  <br>  The letters have also been used, mainly in the U.S., as a way of remembering telephone numbers easily. For example, an interior decorator might license the phone number 1-800-724-6837 but advertise it as the more memorable 1-800-PAINTER.<br>  <br>  Sometimes advertisers will advertise a number with a mnemonic word in the number that has more letters than there are digits in the phone number. Usually, this means that you just stop dialing at 7 digits after the area code or that the numbers are ignored by the switchboard.<br>  <br>  In recent times, the letters on the keys are needed also for entering text on mobile phones, for text messaging, entering names in the phone book, etc.; multi-tap and predictive text systems are used.|`|FgTkF31iaa	back in the old day you prefex was a word EMPIRE 2-2222 the EM were 36|`|39yiT45vaa	TEXTING!!!|`|GexgmXMJaa	well there is something called texting..did you know that?|`|sseHOWN6aa	it's easier to text with a keyboard.i wish i had a phone with a key board.<br>  i just have those regular old cell phones.

I really tried to find a fix for you. I am trying to keep my score up with Yahoo Answers. I failed to find a positive answer for you. Sorry.<br>  <br>  It a looks like Hotmail/MSN/live/Microsoft is blocking this from it's users. They might fix the problem later, but for now your stuck. I do not have a paid email account. I have one for testing and spam. Below you will find a link where you can get more information, but for now hotmail is not allowing people to do this.<br>  <br>  My recommendation is this.  Your a paying customer contact customer service for hotmail and ask them. The more people complain the more they might reconsider changing this. <br>  <br>  If not do what I did years ago. Go with a none MSN/Microsoft email account. <br>  <br>  Sorry I could not solve your problem.

SP1ZpEiuaa	Hmm, it seems you might possibly have something wrong with your hard drive. You may want to call the Sony help line and make sure its not. Or it could just be that the server you are in is just too busy, or your connection may be weak. If it is the connection (if you have wireless) try moving it closer to your ps3, or just upgrade your wireless box. Hope my info helps. P.S. to the guy behind me, you can send messages while playing a game ;)|`|UzV0jc2haa	I don't know why but i know this happens when I'm playing any game sometimes.

euHZPsQYaa	You can try and clear your cache, but I don't think that's the problem. It might be just the GPU trying to keep up with your game. You might be moving too quickly for it to load the textures in time.

a9JrkCpRaa	well it looks like you have a pretty powerful computer, and yes i would be worried about it overheating if you have not taken the necessary steps to prevent it. <br>  <br>  1) make sure you have a good heat sink, you know that fan that goes on top of your processor. if you are really doin hard core stuff, you might want to invest in water cooling, however ud have to be a real serious computer nerd to put your comp under that type of pressure.<br>  <br>  2) make sure there is a good air circulation system in your case. My computer is very close to the same build as yours, and i installed 2 exaust fans in the back and one in the side. that is just a precaution,. but youll want atleast 2 exaust fans in there.<br>  <br>  the video card gets very hot as well, however there is a built in fan normally to keep it cool. I know that there is one in urs. if you want to monitor temperature you can install a thermometer in your case. i recommend checking out www.newegg.com they have some good stuff. i bought all my parts off there when i built my desktop.<br>  <br>  Happy gaming!

I think it is quite a good phone.|`|idFvwX9zaa	Well, that's a bit like asking how long a bit of string is!! lol. What megapixel camera would you prefer? Five? Eight? What other qualities do you want/need in a phone?
qGfAlDd2aa	The story about plugging it into the wall is bogus.  If it pulls enough current to get that hot, it would do so even if plugged into a strip.<br>  <br>  However, it would be a good idea to plug it into a strip with a surge protector.  Remember that the surge protector must be plugged into a wall socket with a good ground or it's useless.<br>  <br>  Get a good name surge protector/power strip like APC, Tripp Lite, Woods, etc.  The higher the Joule rateing, the better.  You really can't over do the Joule rating.|`|d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	A quality surge protector is a good idea.  You wouldn't want some errant power surge frying your TV.<br>  <br>  But you don't have to go nuts and buy some expensive one.  Any $10 to $20 one should be fine.
BhNP2P8Xaa	Probably not for a while. I read somewhere the only prototype model available (right, one phone) was stolen from some Microsoft executive.<br>  <br>  Why would want to use a phone designed by Microsoft anyway? The thing would probably route all your calls overseas.
PuBuDXrCaa	A full-year subscription costs $49.99 but it's easier to pay that much once a year that something less every 3 months, but you can use whatever paying method you feel is most comfortable for you. You also need either an Ethernet cord, which comes with your 360 and you plug that into your modem or router. Or you can buy a wireless adapter, which costs more than a long Ethernet cable, but you don't have the hassle of a wire running down to your modem if your Xbox is far away from the modem. Finally, you need a headset and some great online games. If you're into the FPS genre, go with Halo 3 or Call of Duty 4. If not, then find a game you like and go online!|`|1pmgxvm5aa	if you want to use wireless internet you need a wireless antenna for Xbox ($100)  xbox live i would recommend the 1 year subscription ($50) if not that is all the simple things you need because most Xbox 360 games are LIVE|`|nMWx3bkaaa	Headset, for better experience MOST of the time, XBOX Live Card, varies from 1 month to 1 year, obviously an internet connection, and that's pretty much it. You could go ahead and buy a keyboard to write messages better, or an XBOX Live vision camera to take pics, but that's optional.|`|tfSKIvdNaa	what you'll need:<br>  1) headseat (wire is ok)<br>  2)subscription card(3 month $19.99)<br>  3)maybe a wireless controller (used is fine)<br>  <br>  for wireless connection you can get a used wireless adapter(antenna)<br>  <br>  you can buy one from the link down below|`|tTzR3lXFaa	xbox or xbox360.<br>  If your talking about xbox 360 you will just need a xbox live subscription ($40 for 12 months, i think amazon or buy.com has it for $30), you can buy a headset ($15-$20) if you wanna talk to people but most xbox 360 models already come with a headset. The 360 will not be able to connect to your wireless connection without buying a Wireless Networking Adapter($90-$100). If you do not want to buy the wireless network card you can connect the xbox 360 to the internet with a Ethernet cable. <br>  I hope this helps, good luck.|`|uBTqEy4Naa	the best to get is the 12 month subscription($50)<br>  wireless headset another $50<br>  good online games(cod4 and cod5, halo3, gow2)<br>  optional the wireless xbox router $100

XA4Sa81Xaa	Yes it should work. If you can dial the calling card access number, put in your pin then the number you want to send the fax to then it should work. Some fax machine though is a pain in the...to dial all those numbers.
F5fIBGCraa	If you can use the calling card for voice calls over long distance, then it can be used for faxes, too.<br>  <br>  If it hasn't worked so far, there's two possible reasons.<br>  1.  You can't make long distance calls for voice calls even with your calling card.<br>  2.  There may need to be pauses between the access number of the calling card, and the phone number you're trying to reach.  <br>  <br>  If so, when entering the calling card number, you'll have to enter an asterisk (*) for each 1-second pause needed.  If it takes 5 seconds for the access number to connect, then you'd need to use five asterisks between the calling card number and the fax number.|`|dVK7E5Kiaa	I suggest you use online faxing services.

That sucks for a Band.<br>  <br>  The best way to go is to incorporate the Mixer in the chain.  Mic all the amps and drums (direct out of the drum 'brain') and Vocal into the Mixer.  Out of the mixer to the computer.  Then mix the final demo using your software.<br>  <br>  Not sure what's wrong with your Mixer, but all you need is enough channels working to mic what you have.  I'd say out of 24 channels, you probably have at least 12 channels working (I'd hope).  That's plenty for your application.<br>  <br>  The SM-58 is just fine for vocals.  A standard, I might add.  To Mic the amps, I would get some SM-57's (standard as well).  They're about the same as the 58, but a tighter pattern.  You can get them mail order for around $50.00 each, or cheaper.  Like the 58, they'll last a lifetime.  Great units.<br>  <br>  R&R,<br>  db
F5fIBGCraa	As laser pens go, both are the same.  They both emit a beam of the same brightness.  If price is important, go with the cheaper one; you won't lose anything in performance.<br>  <br>  The ones to avoid are those that use the button cells.  They're more compact, but the button cells are expensive and wear out way too quickly.  The pens that use AAA batteries work just as well, and the batteries last a lot longer.  And the batteries are cheaper, too.<br>  <br>  There's only so much you can do with a laser pen.  Once you've created a basic laser pen, it sells for around $10 or so, maybe $15 at the end market.  Not enough profit margin for stores to carry them.  So manufacturers add on special items, like fancy covers or engraving, cosmetic stuff that makes them LOOK better.  But they don't perform any better.  <br>  <br>  Kind of like buying shirts that use cuff links when buttons are plenty good enough.  Some people are willing to spend more just to appear fancy.

9mTctb7jaa	Outside of a television studio, all video is compressed. It is better to think in terms of data rate, mega bits per second, or mbps. miniDV, broadcast HDTV, HDV, and HDD all work at 25 mbps. DVD and SD broadcast television by contrast is 6 mbps. youtube is less than 1 mbps. So compression is not really a reason to not select an HDD camera.  However miniDV does have the special feature of delivering uncompressed audio in the 16 bit mode.  Unless you are producing music CDs off the camera soundtrack, compressed audio should rarely pose a problem.|`|oUuVaQIkaa	it does compress everything into the  hard drive...i go to college and cinema production is my major...|`|TaxYLHbMaa	yes this is true , additionally it is true with every camera that exists , no camera which operates on hdd is an uncompressed format , however there are better formats now and better software to quickly transfer. compressed sound is a falacy , unless you super compress or change the bit rate , the sound will be brilliant.<br>  sony handy cams hdd or sdhc are really good , Superior sound and video quality.

0AUTZt5Aaa	NOTE: Replace the "get" with "trade it in for"<br>  <br>  Why you should get a PS3 and NOT a Xbox 360<br>  <br>  The *expected* lifetimes of current home video game consoles:<br>  <br>  Xbox 360--2005-2010, you'll get 1 and a half years out of it<br>  Wii-2006-2010, you'll get 1 and a half years out of it<br>  Playstation 3-2015 (Sony said they made it to last 10 years, so 2006+10 years=2016, round it down just to be safe), you'll get 7 years out of it.<br>  <br>  In short, it has better reliability, multimedia capabilities, a large list of exclusives and more coming out in 2009 and in the future and it has over-the-top graphical capabilities (google “Heavy Rain”). And to those who say the Xbox 360 is cheaper, well then just look at the following list:<br>  <br>  With the PS3, you get:<br>  -A Blu-Ray player, which if you wanted one of equal value would blow at least a $700 hole in your wallet<br>  -Free online service<br>  -An ever-growing list of exclusives, like Resistance 2, LittleBig Planet, Motorstorm: Pacific Rift, Metal Gear Solid 4 and in the future: inFamous, Killzone 2, God of War 3, Uncharted 2, L.A. Noire, Heavy Rain and Massive Action Game (M.A.G.—in which over 256 players will be able to play on the same map at the same time, 128 VS 128)<br>  -More flexible in terms of hardware, e.g. swappable HDD, USB mini cable, etc.<br>  -Built in, superior Wi-Fi<br>  -Web browser<br>  -A super sleek system complete with chrome trim and a slot loading disc drive<br>  -HDMI 1.3, Xbox 360 only has HDMI 1.2 (major difference despite only a 0.1 difference)<br>  <br>  With the Xbox 360, you get:<br>  -DVD Player/upconverter<br>  -Xbox live, which is $50/year, and not even worth it<br>  -Halo 3 and Gears of War 2 (that’s a lot of exclusives compared to the PS3, if you ask me: P)<br>  -Umm…can’t really say anything about non-proprietaryness, because Microsoft inflates the prices for their accessories. 120GB for $150? With the PS3, you can upgrade to 500GB for $110!<br>  -A 1 in 3 failure rate (it's not "if", it's "when")<br>  -Many people are on their 5th or 6th 360's already because of RROD, and my friend is on his 12th!<br>  <br>  So here’s a quick run-down of what you must buy with the PS3 and 360:<br>  <br>  PS3:<br>  Console $400<br>  Game $60<br>  Controller $55<br>  Charger $2-10--any USB mini cable will do<br>  Total: $517 ($2 USB mini cable)<br>  <br>  Really, if you bought all the things the PS3 offers SEPERATELY, you would be able to buy roughly 3 PS3's with that money (gaming console+computer+SUPERB Blu Ray player)<br>  <br>  Xbox 360:<br>  Console $300<br>  Game $60<br>  Controller $60<br>  Play and Charge kit x2 $60 (for 2 controllers)<br>  Xbox Live $60<br>  Wi-Fi $100<br>  Total: $640<br>  <br>  That’s not cheaper, so get a grip on it! The multi-platform games are using about 25% of the PS3's graphical potential. So there's lots of wiggle room in the future for much more brighter, detailed and massive environments.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, most multiplatform games are using about 98% of the 360’s potential. And they look the same, if not better on the PS3. At this rate in 1 year, the PS3 will have outshone the 360 graphic wise. It’s just that the 8-core Cell Broadband Processor is very complex, and takes developers time to get used to. And they are getting the hang of things. The PS3 has a very good reliability rate: only 0.2% failure rate (note the decimal), while Xbox 360's have a 30% failure rate. So, for every 1000 of both consoles produced, 2 PS3's are defective, whilst about 330 Xbox 360's are defective. The numbers speak for themselves. Many game developers have OPENLY stated that in the near future, and right now, they will use the PS3 as a lead-developing platform, and then they will port the games to the 360.<br>  <br>  Xbox Live VS PSN? The only thing you are missing is cross voice chat, which can easily be solved by using a telephone, or even in PSN’s V3.00 update, which we will be seeing soon enough.<br>  <br>  The PS3 has sold 21 million units in 2 years. The Xbox 360 has sold 28 million in 3 years. Plus a 33% failure rate, that means that 9.24 million units are either refurbished ones or replacements. So really, the amount of one-time buyers is about 19 million. So really, the PS3 has sold 21 million in 2 years, while the Xbox 360 has sold 19 in 3 years, and the PS3 has a higher face value ($199.99 vs. $399.99)<br>  <br>  So in conclusion, the PS3 is better—you get the most bang for your buck, and it's an incredibly advanced all-in-one home media center hub. You can even install Linux or Windows XP and use it as a computer—legally! While with the Xbox 360, Microsoft will ban your 360 from certain things, if you install the OS at all (just try to bypass the security).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  --PS3 expert--|`|jxpV13rTaa	yes you should..here are a few reasons why<br>  <br>  PS3 <br>  -one of the best blu ray players on the market (if not THE best)<br>  -free online play<br>  -rechargeable controllers<br>  -VERY reliable and durable<br>  -will have more games than the 360 at the end of 2009 (with bigger and better titles)<br>  -online play is great<br>  -amazing graphics<br>  -great selection of games<br>  -game discs are blue ray<br>  -better graphics card and faster processor than 360<br>  -only 0.2% defective rate after opened from box<br>  -won best console of 2008<br>  -built in free wifi<br>  <br>  360<br>  -larger online community<br>  -online costs money to use<br>  -30% defective rate after opened from box (yes, 30!)<br>  -breaks down and creates the ring of death (scoaring of the discs until they arent readable)<br>  -amazing graphics<br>  -great selection of games<br>  -has HD DVD player (which is obsolete and useless because they only make Blu Ray DVDs, not HD DVDs.)<br>  -not cheaper. wifi adapter is 100 bucks and 1 year of online is 50 ($150 added to any bill)<br>  <br>  Dont waste your time with an xbox they will just break. i have owned both for a long time and the PS3 is by far the better choice. so its 100 dollars more...big deal. you get a larger hard drive and an amazing blu ray player. dont listen to bias people. you will get xbox lovers saying how the ps3 is junk. they are beyond ignorant. they are both amazing but the ps3 triumphs.|`|mb3ooc3uaa	This is a PS3 forum, of course people are gonna say get a PS3. If you posted this in a 360 forum they would say keep the 360 most likely. I think 360 has better online games and PS3 has better single player games. Thats why I bought a 360. Yes 360 cost money to play online, I just bought a 13month Live card for $30. People who play World of Warcraft pay that much for 2 months. Just look at what games are out for each console and figure out what you want to play. Don't let others decide what you want to play.|`|QIlhmWwBaa	hahah "--ps3 expert--" <br>  sad and funny at the same time<br>  <br>  don't ask for opinions buy the one you like the most the one with the exclusive games you like the most <br>  do not get something only because of a fanboy opinion|`|pl2SocVKaa	sell it get ps3 simple|`|4gyrvY7Jaa	You should definitely trade you XBOX for a PS3!

It also has great exclusives! GoW3, Uncharted 2, inFamous, Killzone 2, Resistance 2, Heavy Rain, and much more. The graphics are better and has less lag than XBOX Live. You cannot go wrong with a PS3!|`|xwEPYEqSaa	Everything the 360 does PS3 does better. Online is free on PS3 and it is better than Xbox Live. You pay 50$ a year for Xbox's online service. Honestly you can't go wrong with PS3. Xbox's have a 33% failure rate while PS3s have just 1%. PS3 has a larger and game collection with more of a variety of games. PS3 has a lot of great games coming out this year like Killzone 2, God of War III, InFAMOUS, MAG and Uncharted: Among Thieves. PS3 has better sports games (exclusives like NBA 09 The Inside and MLB: The Show) It has better racing games (Motorstorm, Ridge Racer, Grand Turismo)Trust me you will not be disappointing in the PS3. It's cheaper too.<br>  <br>  Price Comparasion:<br>  Xbox 360 Pro (60GB): 300$<br>  Wi-fi Adapter: 100$<br>  1 Year subscription to Xbox Live: 50$<br>  One New game: 60$<br>  Total: 510$<br>  <br>  80GB PS3: 400$<br>  Wi-fi: Free<br>  Playstation Network (online): Free<br>  One New game: 60$:<br>  Total: 460$<br>  <br>  It's cheaper to get a pS3 and you get more for what you payed for.<br>  <br>  Blu-Ray player<br>  Blue-tooth capabilities<br>  HDMI<br>  and a lot more.<br>  <br>  While Xbox comes with none of those.<br>  <br>  PS3's controls run of a rechargeable battery.

Remember the graphics for the xbox360 is maxed out so u wont see better graphics then gears of war2 because there no space doe the disc. but 4 the ps3 its just the start, and 4 2009 ps3 has far more better exclusives
F5fIBGCraa	Nope.  Won't work.  A 9.6v battery is considered drained when it drops down to 8.4v, even though there is still technically electricity left in the battery.  So charging it at that rate would only maintain the level of 'discharge'.<br>  <br>  The Mah rating only applies to charge rate or discharge rate, so it's entirely inapplicable in your situation since you'd never charge the battery with that voltage level.|`|4fWZL4TRaa	Just try it out. Not much chance of harm being done. Going by the voltages these are NiCad or NiMH batteries, so the charger is constant current and so has some reserve in voltage. It will also take longer because the different battery is a larger capacity.<br>  <br>  If these are battery packs they may have a sensor in them to prevent overcharge. Generally fast chargers are designed to go with specific battery packs so they don't overheat them. If the battery gets hotter than about 45 degrees C that is overdoing it. You could let everything cool down for a few hours then try again. Of course it is essential that the charger is connected to the battery the right way around. If the new pack doesn't have appropriate connections and sensor for the charger that is a problem.<br>  <br>  Mostly with this charger and battery combination the worst outcomes are the battery won't get charged or won't get fully charged, or perhaps won't stop charging automatically.|`|yDKMJ97Haa	I'm assuming 8.4 and 9.6 are voltages. If the voltages are different, no.
Cl8FwsI2aa	No clue.|`|QAKNeENwaa	What it sounds like is that you can't charge it. That must mean you've charged it the maximum amount it can be charged. Buy another one.
4cMuedpWaa	For the iPhone you have to take in consideration a couple of things.<br>  <br>  You're not forced to if you bought the iPhone elsewhere BUT if you're upgrading with the same company, you will more likely BE forced to get the data plan. (Now, I am no fan of contracts but an iPhone without a data plan is as useless as a car without engine)<br>  <br>  The iPhone costs are listed below:<br>  <br>  Brand new iPhones:<br>  <br>  8GB= $ 199<br>  16GB= $ 299<br>  <br>  Refurbished iPhones:<br>  <br>  8GB= $ 99<br>  16GB= $ 199<br>  <br>  When you're eligible with an upgrade with U.S. wireless carriers, it usually means that your contract is up to renewal.<br>  <br>  In that case, by "upgrading" your phone, you are also renewing your contract for two more years.<br>  <br>  Internet access requires a $ 30/month data plan for the iPhone.<br>  <br>  iPhone 3G is the 2nd Generation of the iPhone. The 3G version has a faster data connection (tri-band UMTS) to use AT&T UMTS network more efficiently.<br>  <br>  iPhone 3G is BY FAR much better than the 1st Generation iPhone.<br>  <br>  The difference between the 8GB and 16GB 3G iPhones ? Basically just the memory capacity.|`|yH8Gnm4yaa	The phone is $199 for the 8gb version and 299 for the 16gb version.Only difference between is how much storage space there is.<br>  <br>  You do need to sign a contract as with all phones.<br>  <br>  3g is basically wireless internet.And with the iphone you must pay 30dollars(around there) each month for internet.|`|AA12133586	3g is just mean faster networking... depend on what iphone you want.. between 150 to 300<br>  <br>  but i know best buy have a special now that if u are reward zone member you can get 100 off with 2 year contract... well if you are not, email me i can give you my member number so u can get a discount<br>  <br>  no internet is not free|`|D6NBfSVoaa	The iPhone will cost you around maybe $250, but just bring extra money in case. I'm not really sure if you're obligated to sign a contract, but I think you don't have to, they just renew the contract I guess, and they add the same things that you had on your phone (eg. Unlimited Text). There is only one iPhone and that's the 3G. The first generation iPhone was discontinued already. You have to pay $30 a month for unlimited internet on your phone. 3G is the third generation of tele standards and technology for mobile networking (you can read more on Wikipedia). It's also good to ask the AT&T employees to help you just in case you have any questions. Hope I helped.

What a suprise the claimed 8.1 phone camera picture was a absolute disgrace you couldnt tell what the picture was. Mine the Nikon D40 was amazing with no distortion at all superb picture.<br>  To be honest I wouldn't waste my money, I dont care if the phone camera had 20 megapixels, it couldn't compete with my SLR camera.<br>  <br>  My opinion, this is a money making scam.

5M9WbWToaa	there is something wrong with your phone, same thing happend to me with my last phone.<br>  if you cannot return it or anything, try buying an external memory sorce (micro SD card)<br>  there is a slot for it on the right side of the phone when you take off the battery back, once you put the extra memory into it..tell it to "save to card" and everything will be put onto that card than into your phone.
