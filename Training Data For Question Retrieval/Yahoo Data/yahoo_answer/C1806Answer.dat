n7792ixraa	I went to school at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, TX (where I got my CS degree).  Shortly after I graduated, they started offering a program that focuses solely on game design and development:    http://guildhall.smu.edu/Curriculum.12.0...    Something like that would give you the fundamentals of all the aspects of game design.    You need to decide what it is you want to do in this field - coders generally don't do the artwork from what I've learned - so that'd be your first fork in the road.  Then, determine what kind of programming you want to do - for example, if you're working on a graphics engine, let's say, do you have good physics/math skills, that sort of thing?  Or would you be focused more on the coding in a different part of the game, such as AI, online multiplayer (network programming), etc.    Granted I'm not in that field - but have looked into it enough to determine that there's definitely many options in the industry.  You just need to pick what you're most interested in.|`|33121fc0c2bea9ea4d671e5e2438e785aa	What I can tell you is follows:    * there's no such thing as "syllabus for game designer". The only way you'll get to be a game designer is get your foot in the industry and/or design games and get enough of them on your resume so people will trust you with their money to develope games.     * game developer is basically a programming position, but also a lot of management and integration. You have to help the producer push other departments if they are lagging, cut features from design if not doable, but not cut so much so the game changes completely, and so on and so forth.     * nothing beats practical experience. If you don't have THAT, then education is better than nothing. So... get some experience first if you can. Internship, temp positions, whatever.|`|3RTq1shzaa	Any game is a software. So it needs all the basic concepts from computer science. Even if u choose the other 2 courses, you will study a lot in common.    Also, there are lots of MS courses which focuses on Game development.    So according to me, you can choose CS|`|mGYaT87baa	You're going to need a Computer Science degree. Game developers work long hours for not much pay, as there are plenty of young hot shot programmers that want that job. Most of the people that I know that have done this, do so for only a few years, then wind up writing business software, where the pay and hours are better (but not great). I caution anyone going into software that programming is a global job, and you must compete with an ever increasing supply of cheap overseas talent. Average wages for CS majors have been falling since 2000, and this trend shows no sign of stopping.|`|AA10929108	a bachelors is the minimum you should acquire  and i would suggest going for a Computer Science or Information Systems degree    a major that only relates to game making doesn't give you any employment opportunities outside of game development, and with these financially troubled times you want to make yourself as employable as possible    now there are 2 parts of game design:    the programming end  which is coding a game    and the design end  which is 3D/2D modeling and mapping    in most cases yer gonna get a job doing one or the other  but you can learn to do both if yer dedicated  in fact yer going to have to be dedicated to learn just 1

dpvx6SIqaa	I already answered your same question for 8-bit.    16-bit representation means to just pad the binary number so it's 16-bits long..    If -36 is 1101 1100 in 8-bit 2's complement...    Then we need to pad on binary digits to make it 16-bits. Since the number is negative, we pad on 1s. If the number was positive, we'd pad on 0s.    So 1101 1100 becomes the following in 16-bits:  1111 1111 1101 1100    Each digit in a binary number represents a bit. So 16-bit means make it 16 digits long.

ZkELw9wzaa	Your school filter can detect a proxy as soon as you try it and either block it on the fly or notify an admin to block it manually. The bottom line is that all proxy's will eventually get blocked. As the filtering software gets more advanced they will get blocked faster and faster.    There is also the question of the rules and laws you are breaking by trying to hack your school security system.    Finally even if you got a proxy to work for a short time you are inviting the proxy owner, many of whom are using the proxy for hacking purposes, to infect and or hijack your school network. Read more on the dangers of proxy's below.|`|td6WXhv4aa	Circumventing your School Firewall or Hacking it is illegal you can and will get in serious trouble.

TXJXcVu0aa	Have you tried signing into the administrator account with the password field blank?    To do this in XP whilst logged in on your account press the windows key + L    This will take you to the log on screen. Then press Ctrl+Alt+Del then in the box that comes up type administrator as the username and leave the password field blank.    If you get logged in you can then go to the user panel in the control panel and set your account to have administrator priviledges.    Might not help that much but hey its worth a try!|`|2LbTrlQnaa	If you're using Vista, open Command prompt as Administrator and type  net user administrator /active:yes  press ENTER and restart the computer  You now have a separate stand alone Administrator account.  If you're using XP you could try reinstalling XP as a way of permanently resolving your problem
hlDl0g8uaa	--- This will help you....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/lyric/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.    It works very well....just google search for "zillatube"    =============================???

Also, XP doesn't recognize anything past 500 gigs. Microsoft didn't think that storage capacity that would go past 500 gigs. As a result, windows can go up to 500 gigs, and 2gigs of RAM.|`|s4vb9spDaa	YES|`|AA10089212	Yes it should it wont recognize a certain amount of ram but hard drive no problem.|`|Yg2iIneKaa	yes you can|`|pUzJiMUcaa	32 bit Windows with SP1 or above will see up to 2TB's.

Now for the main part: This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).  Already have a scanner, make sure your virus database is updated BUT do not use AVG free (Too many false positives).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !    NOTE: These steps are also a good way to clean your computer and give it more zip without cost !|`|1WaTRF3Caa	You have to make sure you are clean before you do anything else to prevent spyware.    FIRST!!!  Go to a friends/families computer and download Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware    http://www.malwarebytes.org/    Download the program, then RENAME IT (VERY important, lots of spyware will prevent this program from installing). After renaming it, burn it to a CD. Now, goto your computer and restart it. Repeatedly press F8 before windows boots. A menu will come up asking you how you want to boot. Boot into "Safe Mode". Log on as the Administrator and install the program from the CD. After it is installed, run it and do a FULL SCAN of ALL hard-drives. After it is done scanning, remove all problems it finds. Now, shut off your computer. Turn it on again and press F8. This time boot into "Safe Mode with Networking" and log on as the Administrator. After it boots, open Anti-Malware. Connect to the internet and go to the update tab and update the program. Run another FULL SCAN of all hard drives. Repair anything it finds.    After that, reboot normally.  Now, download and install Firefox  www.getfirefox.com    After that, download and install Spybot: Search and Destroy  http://www.safer-networking.org  Update Spybot and goto immunize.  Apply the immunizations and you will stop your computer from even connecting to bad websites and bad ad servers.    BE SURE TO USE FIREFOX AND ONLY FIREFOX!!|`|uAEZeyAAaa	your laptop has a trojan downloader which downloads new threats whenever you connect to the internet. so better get a good antivirus like kaspersky.it removes such malware effectively.|`|WQ0DzpByaa	As long as you have javascript enabled, you're going to get tracking cookies from the ad servers that put the adds on Hotmail, etc. To minimize the number, get FireFox browser and install the NoScript add-on.

Speakers are just speakers, they are not a device that the computer can recognize. They just plug into a headphone jack.    The sound card is the sound device that processes the sound and sends it to the speakers. You need to install the Drivers for the device before the computer can use it. Think of a driver as an instruction manual for the computer so it knows how to use the sound card.    All devices have drivers installed, but sometimes they become corrupt or lost.    Go to the website of the company that manufactured your computer, they will have the drivers for the sound card available for download.|`|GivrkwxYaa	their is not a problem with speakers ,,their only wrong is the driver of audio is not installed properly,,reinstall to fix it

AA10140002	Looks very nice, except for a few things - on your portfolio page, a little explanation about each of the websites that you've completed would be a good thing - it would provide you with some content for that page. I would like to see the samples that you have a lot smaller in size with the information about each one off to the side. Perhaps show your portfolio like a gallery. As it is now, they appear to look like advertising, not a portfolio. Your logos page has nothing on it. I also noticed that you placed the scroll bar off to the left, instead of the normal right side.     If you want to get opinions on your website, it would be best to complete the website first. Did you use a template or did you create this on your own? I suspect a complete template that you utilized available within the free hosting.    I also noticed that you have no Doctype at the top of your HTM files. You have not utilized any sort of CSS and you used tables for your design. You have no Meta Tags to speak of such as Description, keywords, etc.    You do not have your own domain. You are using a freebie hosting company, which tells me that you are not taking your business serious enough to establish yourself with your own domain name.    Did this validate without errors at the W3C? I doubt it because I came up with 36 errors. Go here and check it out for yourself: http://validator.w3.org/    If you're going to run a web design business, you should at least validate everything within your own website and make sure it's perfectly coded without error.|`|PwwC4kDzaa	Not bad, But still needs lot of work...|`|ibyukUWbaa	so you build websites? not very intresting i have no idea what it is about, sorry i lost interest in the home page and  on the portfolio page the ads are FAR too big!! i suggest google advertising because i couldnt be bothered to go underneath those mahoosive adds, try to make it clear what your ebsite is actually about and try to make it more eye freindly.
AA10140002	I am not familiar with CoreFTP, but upon checking them out, I saw that this particular program hasn't been updated in over a year.     I would recommend FileZilla as your FTP program because I know for a fact that it does what it's supposed to do, and that's to upload your files to your host without any problems. I use it almost every day without any problems and it's updated regularly. Try it - it's free: http://filezilla.sourceforge.net/    P.S. My files are uploaded into my public_html directory and my files also have the extension of .html - so for you to name your home page index.html should NOT be a problem.|`|AtPlzpi5aa	I have used Core FTP and it does work fine.    Ask your ISP where you need to put your files on the remote computer and what to name the home page - some use .htm and others .html    From what you have said, your page should be visible on the web. Also, ask the ISP to view the server and see if your pages are there and in the correct directory.|`|fe5b58b4853363f7e1c0935847a51969aa	public_html?!

Going off this figure we can say that for 1024x768 we would set the width at 984px or just round it down to 980. You can give yourself a little more width by disabling the scrollbar using the css    html { overflow: hidden; }    I personally center my pages using a div with the id pagecontent and using the following css    body { text-align: center; padding: 0; margin: 0; }   pagecontent { margin: 0 auto; text-align: left; }|`|AA10140002	Make the width in percentages, this way it would work in either resolution.

XsZ0Aaxpaa	There are many ways you can create a web page. One such way is to use dreamweaver or frontpage, they are somewhat more complicated than the conventional package that can be bought but, if you want to learn instead of have an instant web site then they are the option to take. I recommend you buy a book on how to use the software as for a beginner it will be complicated for you, you will have to do some research on how much it would cost for a domain name (.com), how much the software is as they differ from 4,000 to 40 pounds depending on level at which you wish to developer. Personally i own dreamweaver CS3 which is pro at the top end, but i think that you will be more suited to learn from a package, I do not know whether you have a mac or PC,so if you have a Mac buy iWeb as it is the easiest way for Mac beginners, If you have a PC there are many free sites that allow you to make your own website, Like yahoo geocities, But i Have used another package called MrSite.com. It sorts out all of the things like domain names (you get a free .com address) and advertising and you can sell things through it using Pay Pal, My brother used it and said it was the best Package he has used so far (he has wasted lots of money on useless packages).|`|vTjOIF2Yaa	Use MS Front page or Dreamweaver.

mgcwYth5aa	It is really not that hard, to learn to be a developer takes considerably longer, but just to be a designer isn't that long at all, if you already know the creative suite then you are halfway there.  Do you know about slices in Photoshop? How about saving your whole layout as a web page? Those are good places to start because with Photoshop you can actually design the whole layout, cut it up with slices and then save it as html and images and it does a lot of the job for you.  All that you have to do at that point is no the code so you can optimize it!  So you are on the right track!|`|AA10140002	It takes as long as it takes. Anyone can learn the basics of HTML, (X)HTML and CSS in order to create webpages; slap a few pictures/graphics on the pages and you have a website.  Of course, knowing what looks good, what color combinations to use, what font selections & sizing, the navigation system and ease of getting around the website, constant testing to make sure that the site looks good in all the major browsers since it may render differently in each one, utilizing SEO practices in order to acquire a good ranking within the search engines - all this and more constitute a good design.    But...you need to begin somewhere..so learning HTML, (X)HTML and CSS is a good start.  |`|7kVWJ4ycaa	It won't take very long using tools like Dreamweaver or comparable GUI web design tools. You're primarily looking at the learning curve for using the toolset which will depend on your ability to learn. I can't make any assumptions about your ability but I'd say on average you could be creating websites with a new tool inside of a couple of weeks even if you're a slow learner.    The real catch is how long it takes to make GOOD websites. That could take a lifetime or perhaps even never based on a lot of what I've seen online.|`|3DVLtSraaa	one month or two I think enough|`|8YuFNjrTaa	it's hard to say because there is no point at which you say to yourself "I'm done learning there's nothing left to know" I would say you should plan to learn for at least 2 years before you can get a decent job with a company.|`|s85HTyPcaa	It's going to take forever. Things changes really fast in web design. New browsers, new programming, new designs and more. Don't stop learning until you feel like you don't need web design as your skill.    Learning just HTML and CSS won't take a month. (It does take more time for non-english speakers.)

9sgfh8BUaa	There's a couple of ways. I guess it depends on what you mean by "pop-up".    A: On your link, you could add a title='' or alt='' . In some browsers, text will float over the link.    B: On your link, add a onmouseover='thatfunction()'. In Javascript, build 'thatfunction'. It's one line, with alert(''). The alert will "popup" everytime the user hovers over the link.    C: Similiar to B: Set up your link with onmouseover='thatfunction()', also with onmouseout='otherfunction()'. Only instead, you want to use a div instead of an alert. With CSS, make your div invisible. When the function is called, it becomes visible and your message appears. When you move the cursor, div turns invisible again. (There's a few ways to do this sort of div hyjinx.)    EDIT: Yea, I forgot. If the user has javascript disabled, B and C won't work at all.

sJ0sLvaPaa	It probably has to do with your idle time power settings (screensaver, put the computer to sleep, etc.)  Set those to "none" for screen saver and "never" for shut down time & "put computer to sleep" time.  That should clear your problem right up.

It did only have 128MB and spent all it's time chewing at the hard drive but it's a bit better now.  If it had 512MB I think it'd be quite ok but it only has one memory slot.  It has no 3D whatsoever, just 2.5MB video memory.  If you put as much memory in it as it'll take then it'll be fine, just remember that if it's only designed to take PC100 memory that PC133 won't work in it, so look up it's specs online before you buy.  My daughter insists on having a proper mouse and hates laptop pads, it may make it easier to use.    EDIT:  Windows 2000 and Windows XP use the same Windows NT core, so as long as you don't have everything running at the same time it'll be fine.  Pay attention to programs that start with Windows and disable any unnecesary ones.  As said, turn most of the screen effects off too.  A lot of programs refuse to run with Windows 2000 so XP will probably be better.  There's lots of software available for such a machine, remember it's not that long ago that an 800MHz laptop was the newest thing available.  You may find that it works better with Service Pack 2 as SP3 installs a lot of unnecesary extras.|`|1NWjta2jaa	Yes, it will. If you add a little more RAM, it will be better.|`|b1256d852b56b556e6bb26806d1c64eaaa	If you uninstalled the 2000 program & installed the XP program, I'm sure it'd work just fine. Best check with a local PC shop first though.|`|elY5vkVyaa	XP really needs at least 256Mbs and 800mhz is pretty slow, it would work but it would be too slow unless you are only running a bare minimum of programs.    To get the most out of an old laptop like that I would keep it on Windows 2000 and see if you can find a cheap laptop RAM stick (make sure it is the correct one) to upgrade it to 256Mbs.    Windows 2000 is still supported by Microsoft so it can be updated and it is secure to use on the internet.

AA10182911	you can download it here and everything you need to know about getting started is on this site.    http://www.mirc.com/|`|c72492a8982417e9ed4ef0193f28ec4caa	IRC is a chat technology, and thus you need a client to connect to it. mIRC is a good free software to connect to IRC from.    Then, you need to find a server and a chatroom. To find them, well, you gotta search the web. Try googling IRC chatroom finder.    Then to download, it's an involved process, and thus is why IRC is usually where you can find most software as "normal" users have no idea how to download via IRC.    IRC usually uses a few protocols to download files, mIRC supports all of them. Each channel or user has different ways to download their files... it's quite complicated. Usually you'll see people say something like:    User: Type 2234 to download my files.    You type it in and it connects you to their files. Then you have to use some commands to browse the folder structure. Each protocol has different commands.    Like I said, IRC is for very advanced users... not the normal ones. BitTorrent is more user friendly and is easier to use and understand. You can also download via BT, whatever size things. I will not tell you how to download software and movies because that is promoting piracy which we don't do here. However, to use BitTorrent I'd google it. You'll need a BT client though, such as Azureus to download torrent files.

AA11678124	for starters, if you are comfortable using MSWord, then why dont you open the XML file in MSWord? It will work like every other text file.  There are XML editors available, but I think you are better off not trying to learn them right now (if you are pressed for time)    However since editing XML is tricky, I will tell you a simple rule of thumb. Open and edit the XML file in MSWord, then save it and then reopen the same in Internet Explorer.   If things are fine, IE will show the whole file, elsewise it will point you to the exact line where the problem is.    Hope this helps|`|03e04cb6e6bbcd1c46ae6eb8d8d306bcaa	notepad can help edit the XML file. there is another very good XML editing prog it is XMLSpy.

Many sites use AdSense to monetize their content and some webmasters work hard to maximize their own AdSense income. They do this in three ways:  1.They use a wide range of traffic generating techniques including but not limited to online advertising.   2.They build valuable content on their sites; content which attracts AdSense ads and which pay out the most when they get clicked.   3.They use copy on their websites that encourage clicks on Ads. Note that Google prohibits people from using phrases like "Click on my AdSense ads" to increase click rates. Phrases accepted are "Sponsored Links" and "Advertisements".

The number one thing to do to get money for your blog is to get traffic. Add a free statcounter (statcounter.com) to your page and view your traffic. That way you can tell if your getting new readers and if old readers are returning (there is two types of meters, page views and unique visits). Also, a way to boost traffic is to have an attractive looking blog (HTML+CSS knowledge required) and good content, a blog about your daily life (only in rare cases where someone actually does have a very interesting life) is going to be read on a daily basis. Be helpful, most people look to blogs for some type of help, news, or advice.|`|ff83872d50eae83b8306a68b541c7e0baa	Hello, the hardest part in AdSense is getting traffic to your pages and have people to click on ads.

For instance...          Your text....      What this will do is create you a section which has scrollbars, what you could add is ohter stylesheets as well..  Take a look at this link: http://www.quirksmode.org/css/overflow.h...    Now the other way is to do this:      That is mainly used for FORMS.

AA12277754	While the characteristics that one expects of graduates are related to the learning objectives associated with the core units, the expectations one assigns to those who complete an undergraduate degree in computer science reflect a more global level of student achievement. The learning objectives detailed in Appendix A specify what a student must know at the conclusion of any particular unit. In this section, the goal is to identify the characteristics that a successful graduate should possess. At a broad level, these characteristics can be expressed as follows:     System-level perspective. The objectives associated with individual units in the body of knowledge tend to emphasize isolated concepts and skills that can lead to a fragmented view of the discipline. Graduates of a computer science program must develop a high-level understanding of systems as a whole. This understanding must transcend the implementation details of the various components to encompass an appreciation for the structure of computer systems and the processes involved in their construction and analysis.   Appreciation of the interplay between theory and practice. A fundamental aspect of computer science is the balance between theory and practice and the essential link between them. Graduates of a computer science program must understand not only the theoretical underpinnings of the discipline but also how that theory influences practice.   Familiarity with common themes. In the course of an undergraduate program in computer science, students will encounter many recurring themes such as abstraction, complexity, and evolutionary change. Graduates should recognize that these themes have broad application to the field of computer science and must not compartmentalize them as relevant only to the domains in which they were introduced.   Significant project experience. To ensure that graduates can successfully apply the knowledge they have gained, all students in computer science programs must be involved in at least one substantial software project. Such a project demonstrates the practical application of principles learned in different courses and forces students to integrate material learned at different stages of the curriculum.   Adaptability. One of the essential characteristics of computer science over its relatively brief history has been an enormous pace of change. Graduates of a computer science program must possess a solid foundation that allows them to maintain their skills as the field evolves. Strategies for achieving this adaptability are described in section 11.3.|`|AA12028206	Wow GeniuS... talk about doing someone else's homework... you're cool man...    I will contribute too...

J|`|AA10871530	From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia    The term Web 2.0 refers to a second generation of services available on the World Wide Web that lets people collaborate and share information online. In contrast to the first generation, Web 2.0 gives users an experience closer to desktop applications than the traditional static Web pages. Web 2.0 applications often use a combination of techniques devised in the late 1990s, including public web service APIs (dating from 1998), Ajax (1998), and web syndication (1997). They often allow for mass publishing (web-based social software). The concept may include blogs and wikis.    The term was popularized by O'Reilly Media and MediaLive International as the name for a series of web development conferences that started in October 2004. CMP Media, which purchased MediaLive, claims the term as a service mark for live events, reserving exclusive use of the term for its own conferences.    Some members of the development community see Web 2.0 as an overly vague buzzword, incorporating whatever is newly popular on the Web (such as tags and podcasts), without having any fixed meaning.

O crack  uma mistura de cocana em forma de pasta n?o refinada com bicarbonato de sdio. Esta droga se apresenta na forma de pequenas pedras e pode ser at cinco vezes mais potente do que a cocana. O efeito do crack dura, em mdia, dez minutos.   Sua principal forma de consumo  a inala??o da fuma?a produzida pela queima da pedra.  necessrio o auxlio de algum objeto como um cachimbo para consumir a droga, muitos desses feitos artesanalmente com o auxlio de latas, pequenas garrafas plsticas e canudos ou canetas. Os pulm?es conseguem absorver quase 100% do crack inalado.     Os primeiros efeitos do crack s?o uma euforia plena que desaparece repentinamente depois de um curto espa?o de tempo, sendo seguida por uma grande e profunda depress?o. Por causa da rapidez do efeito, o usurio consome novas doses para voltar a sentir uma nova euforia e sair do estado depressivo.     O crack tambm provoca hiperatividade, ins?nia, perda da sensa??o de cansa?o, perda de apetite e conseqente perda de peso e desnutri??o.     Com o tempo e uso constante da droga, aparecem um cansa?o intenso, uma forte depress?o e desinteresse sexual.   Os usurios de crack apresentam um comportamento violento, s?o facilmente irritveis.     O crack  uma droga mais forte que as outras, as pessoas que o experimentam sentem uma compuls?o ( desejo incontrolvel) de us-lo de novo, estabelecendo rapidamente uma dependncia fsica, pois querem manter o organismo em ritmo acelerado.   Os usurios, em sua maioria, tm entre 15 e 25 anos de idade e vm tanto de bairros pobres da periferia como de ricas mans?es de bairros nobres.  Como o crack  uma das drogas de mais altos poderes viciantes, a pessoa, s de experimentar, pode tornar-se um viciado.   Ele n?o , porm, das primeiras drogas que algum experimenta. De um modo geral, o seu usurio j usa outras, principalmente cocana, e passa a utilizar o crack por curiosidade, para sentir efeitos mais fortes, ou ainda por falta de dinheiro, j que ele  bem mais barato por grama do que a cocana.   Todavia, como o efeito do crack passa muito depressa, e o sofrimento por sua ausncia no corpo vem em 15 minutos, o usurio   usa-o em maior quantidade, fazendo gastos ainda maiores do que j vinha fazendo.   Para conseguir, ent?o, sustentar esse vcio, as pessoas come?am a usar qualquer mtodo para compr-lo.   Submetidas s press?es do traficante e do prprio vcio, j n?o disp?em de tempo para ganhar dinheiro honestamente; partem, portanto, para a ilegalidade: trfico de drogas, aliciamento de novas pessoas para a droga, roubos, assaltos, etc.    Tremores, parania e desconfian?a tambm s?o causados pela droga.   Normalmente, os usurios tm os lbios, a lngua e a garganta queimados por causa da forma de consumo da substancia. Apresentam tambm problemas no sistema respiratrio como congest?o nasal, tosse, expectora??o de muco preto e srios danos nos pulm?es.  O estado fisico do usuario fica deplorvel, emagrecem muito e em poucos dias (2 ou 3 dias de uso contnuo) e seus msculos ficam destruidos, como se a droga  os reabsorvessem.    O usuario de crack ante de tudo  um sofredor pois torn-se escravo da droga. Precisa de tratamento.   O Brasil precisa urgente voltar seus olhos para este problema social, que  muito mais grave que se imagina.     O uso mais contnuo da droga pode causar ataque cardaco e derrame cerebral gra?as a um considervel aumento da press?o arterial. Contra??es no peito seguidas de convuls?es e coma tambm s?o causadas pelo consumo excessivo da droga.     Ao contrrio da maioria das drogas, o crack n?o tem sua origem ligada a fins medicinais: ele j nasceu como uma droga para alterar o estado mental do usurio.     O crack surgiu da cocana, feito por traficantes no submundo das favelas e guetos das grandes cidades sendo, portanto, difcil precisar quando e onde realmente ele apareceu pela primeira vez.   O nome "crack" vem do barulho que ele faz quando est sendo queimado para ser consumido.     Existe uma varia??o do crack que tem um poder alucingeno ainda maior, trata-se de uma droga chamada Merla. A Merla apareceu pela primeira vez nas favelas do Grande ABC em S?o Paulo e  feita com sobras do refino da cocana misturada com querosene e gasolina     Para  pessoas que est?o enfrentando este problema sugiro que frequentem o NARANON OU AMOR EXIGENTE que s?o grupos de apoios para familiares e amigos.   Para filhos de dependentes existe o NARATEEN.  Para os usurios de qualquer droga obterem apoio e orienta??o existe o  N.A -  Narcticos An?nimos.  Para os dependentes de lcool existe o AA - alcolicos an?nimos|`|AA10082816	Crack  um pequeno programa que tem como nico objetivo alterar o executvel de outro programa, tornando esse outro programa registrado (ilegalmente).

I suppose there are different experiences; but I used to have wireless and I had nothing but problems with it...it kept breaking the connection or someone was using my signal.  I finally converted it to cable...and I stopped having problems with it.  If you live in a heavily populated area, then it is a problem.  I doubt it is because you are in a different room...but possible.  You may have to experiment with it to find out if it makes a difference.  Try moving it different distances...then contact your service provider and see if they can correct the problem.

You could also move you machine closer to the dLink, but this is only really feasible if you have a laptop. You can always buy a bigger arial for you card, this will improve the signal.

AA12209304	2 simple ways. Rest complicated, i wont discuss with you as you seem to be novice in this subject.    Password attack (guessing): Sometimes the passwords are too simple, like your best friends name, pet's name or others which could be very simple to guess by a person who knows you well.    Forgot password attack: When ou try signing on to check your emails you come across a link that says "Forgot password" People with bad intention can just click on that link put in a email address and answer he questions asked. Again a person who knows you well will be able to answer almost all the questions with ease, and get a password.    Rest attacks include keyloggers, installing backdoors and many such which i wont discuss here because i work to make Internet safer and not vulnerable to attacks. Hope this info helps you.|`|d6a089c5c1e204944116e4ac2a8014bfaa	On a private e-mail system, an administrator can access your e-mail very easily and leave no tracks that he or she has been in the mail-box. Never assume that your company e-mail box is totally secure and private. As to public e-mail systems, people "bluff" their way into accounts by giving just the basic needed information to a help desk person and get a account reset with a new password. You would then know it because you would no longer be able to access your account.|`|e96e5f5c3c6d5fb7e91a67a4eaf395d1aa	hacking into web based email account is one of the toughest job today technically, but if your are good at Social Engineering than it can be  acake walk, social Engineering means fooling someone to reveal theri pass word and sensitive information to you, you can always google the term. Second and best option is Hacking into the system of the Victim then installing some trojan or Keylogger programs, and yes people can also Hijack your account, by clicking on forgot password link and, if they know the information like , you date of birth, postal code, and Secret answer. So make sure you always use a false date of birth while registering, you can always change that info as well once you have registered. You'll never know if your account has been hacked unless the attacker is dumb, change your password frequently, and use your common sense, coz for hackers, human is the weakest link.

I'm not sure what your computer's problem is though.|`|084d9c54d4980e8bfb8230a4414bdf93aa	i don't think that there is some issue with your system ... mostly it is due to some problem with the DNS server. for that u don't have to worry .. the ISP will take care of that..   IP address is an identifier for your computer to the Internet  DNS (Domain naming system) is an Internet service that translates domain names into IP addresses. Because domain names are alphabetic, they're easier to remember. The Internet however, is really based on IP addresses. Every time you use a domain name, therefore, a DNS service must translate the name into the corresponding IP add ress. like the way you have an IP address to identify your computer by the network. communication can be happen only through IP addres. not by the names. so DNS will provide the associated Ip address for any website to your computer for communication. in simple words dns will provide the IP addres of host names for communication to happen

O que doeu (mas superei depois, continue lendo)  perder as informa??es, mas em alguns casos, disse o tcnico d para recupera-las, indicou outro tcnico especializado, o pre?o R$250,00.   Corre atrs de or?amento de pessoas confiveis, manda arrumar, financia um novo, se for o caso, "fa?a das tripas cora??o", se n?o conseguir salvar o teu emprego, salva a tua honra!

De preferencia comece a contar para ele a histria de trs para frente, por exemplo: vamos ficar sem computador 2 ou 3 dias. a "lan"  por minha conta (se tiver abertura para isso)! j mandei arrumar e vou trabalhar fora do horrio se for preciso para recuperar tudo, etc...j pensei que posso fazer tal e tal coisa, o que voc acha? (aceite qualquer sugest?o vinda dele, mesmo que trabalhosa, desde que vivel,  claro, at que voc tenha uma melhor, se tiver, sen?o "arrega?a as mangas e manda ver".   Fiquei triste, mas nem precisei recuperar o contedo do HD velho, pelo menos por enquanto.O tcnico tinha gravado em um conserto anterior o contedo (n?o me falou na hora, pois n?o tinha certeza, mas  pessoa que confio), assim parte foi recuperada, outra parte mais recente recuperei nos e-mails que recebi atravs de cpias, que eu mesma enviei e a parte intermediria posso complementar com instala??o de programas especficos.

You can always choose a service that provides you with a website builder. e.g Geocities.com.     If you want to set up your website manually, then you will need to read through the following instructions:    1. A basic HTML page has the basic HTML tags     -- the html document starts here    Title of Document        Content of document          2. You will need to go through some good HTML tutorials on the web. You can find them out through any search engine.    3. Spice up your page with scripts from javascriptkit.com, dynamicdrive.com, hotscripts.com, php.resourceindex.com, etc    All these websites offer various scripts ... and they are easy to use too!      If you still can't do the coding on your own. You can always go for the easy methods.

AA10140002	First of all, you download the various brushes the same way you would download any file, right click on the link and do a "Save As...". Usually the files are zipped, so you'll need a program to unzip them.     To install - after you have downloaded the file, unzip it to the following directory:  C:\Program Files\Adobe\Photoshop 6.0(or 7.0)\Presets\Brushes (i.e., your photoshop brushes folder). Then open Photoshop and from your brush menu, choose "load brushes" and from the list which will open, choose the brush(es) you would like to load. Once done, choose the brush you have just added to begin using it.

Hai provato tenendo premuto il tasto fn (funzione) per usare i numeri sulla destra? Sono sovrapposti ad altri caratteri e si abilitano con l'apposito tasto.

Il vantaggio di un pezzo esterno  quello che quando butterai via il tuo notebook, il masterizzatore esterno rimarr sempre con te con la possibilit di attaccarlo a qualsiasi altro notebook o computer fisso.

0199a486e42f928e4ca70934378cd78eaa	Dovresti essere pi precisa. Hai provato a disinstallarla togliendo il programma in modo "brutale"? senza andare ad esempio nel programma della Lexmark? Andiamo per ordine.    Generalmente quando s'installa un programma te lo trovi nella barra d'avvio tra tutti i programmi. C'? ci dovrebbe essere anche, sotto la voce del programma della Lexmark, una voce "uninstal". Prova con quello. Altrimenti prova a farlo dal pannello di controllo alla voce "installa applicazioni". Da l, dopo che hai trovato il software della lexmark, c' l'opzione "rimuovi". Altra possibilit? andare nel menu delle stampanti e toglierla (cliccando sopra la stampante e rimuovendola).     Ultima (vado ad ampio raggio perch non so bene il problema): prova a re-installare la stampante (col CD o con i drivers). Eppoi prova a cercare il comando "uninstal" dalla barra dei programmi. Cos dovrebbe funzionare.    Ciao e buona fortuna.    P.S. Ma la Lexmark... costano ancora un botto le cartucce? non conviene una Canon o una Epson?|`|fc9d9b1e67d5672fc8ffa5ba40e9f3a2aa	Aspetta, non farti prendere dal panico.  La procedura corretta per disinstallare la stampante  andare in: Start, Impostazione Accesso ai programmi Programmi, Cambia / Rimuovi programmi.  Se sei andato nella casella delle stampanti e l' hai rimossa da li' la procedura non  corretta, ti rimangono nel PC tutti driver della stampante.  Io ti consiglio di ripetere di nuovo la procedura di installazione della stampante, fare qualche stampa di pagine di prova e alla fine eliminarla completamente seguendo la prima Procedura, ma MAI toglierla dalla Cartella delle stampanti.  Usa LA STESSA porta USB della prima installazione, altrimenti non risolvi il problema.|`|7aee1d53e22a173fb1aced586535060baa	la soluzione  semplice..se hai una qualsiasi versione di windows, controlla che nella barra delle applicazioni (quella in basso, per intenderci), nell'angolo a destra (dove c' l'ora, sempre per intenderci) non ci sia nessuna icona della stampante..se c', cliccaci sopra col tasto destro del mouse e scegli ESCI o CHIUDI..poi riprova a disinstallare..vedrai che funziona ;)|`|79a3c0fe9d166375552c0214a7884466aa	ho avuto anch'io lo stesso problema con una lexmark 1100  dipende dal sistema operativo che hai s,io ho win98ne e da  utilit di sistema-microsoft system information-strumenti-utilit di configurazione di sistema-esecuzione automatica,ho tolto lo spunto da lexmarkx1100 series lasciando quello lex start ed ora non mi d pi problemi  penso che anche con xp pi o meno sia lo stesso  prova poi ad aggiornare i driver della stampante dal sito del fabbricante  ciao  buon lavoro

Welche Leute m?chtest du damit ansprechen (Zielgruppe)?  Um welche Inhalte handelt es sich da berhaupt?  Welche Gr??enordnung schwebt dir vor?  Was soll deine Seite ?k?nnen? (Webshop, 360-Ansichten, Animationen, usw.)  Soll deine Seite in Suchmaschinen gefunden werden?  Was kommt an Zusatzarbeit dazu? (Bildbearbeitung, Grafiken erstellen, Texten usw.)

By the late 1970's database applications became the focus of our consulting activity with both the public and private sectors and we quickly became industry experts.  In the decade that followed our energies were focused on a couple of extremely vertical areas of concentration, the most significant of these being judicial applications.  The results being the development of Blackstone...The Judicial System in 1983.    Since that time our installed base has grown in size and stature as we continually expand our product line for the best solution.  We presently support clients on both a national and international basis with personnel strategically located across the country and a licensed software dealer (Hewlett Packard) in Australia.

The encryption protocol, CSS, is what looks at the DVD player and decides if it's in the correct region and it can go ahead and play the disc.  Since you are burning non-encrypted discs, then yer already golden......the whole world over.  The value that you are changing describes what region you are playing movies in, which should be irrelevant to the write process.|`|1d68d40903dc3be0958d1f2591dfa202aa	you  write me asking me if i've ever heard of not judging lest i be judged?  here's my response to what u posted to one of my questions, i'm sure u won't mind me not answering this question here since that is what u did to me---     u ARE  the one judging because as u wrote that i must like pissing people off, that's why my e-mail is private---no that is not true.   so don't assume.  i like to tell the truth, for one, so if u got pissed off then that is YOUR personal problem--- that is YOUR REACTION to a comment YOU didn't like.   as for not posting my e-mail on yahoo answers, that would just be dumb, and i'm sure lots of people would agree with me, because people try to contact you once u post ur e-mail and it usually has nothing to do with anything on yahoo answers---   i don't need people spamming my inbox.    the other thing is, i don't even believe in hell as a separate place, because if u just turn on the news and see what's going on in the world, all the bad things that  are going on everywhere, u will see just exactly where hell is and what it is really like.    lastly u totally missed my point in my response to your question so don't even compare myself to you, okay?    i will not reprint what u wrote since u posted it on my question, but let me just tell you that me saying you were going to hell anyway was a JOKE, and u didn't even get it because u were too busy judging in the first place, that is what i was trying to show you by writing what i wrote.    stop and think first about questions you want to ask, and if u can't handle people's responses then maybe u should try some therapy and lay off yahoo answers, i'm sure i am not the only person who is going " to piss you off"    think about that before you write any more nonsense trying to tell people off, or trying to put them in their place.  at least i am not a hypocrite.
0199ffbf2e6166cf58216c6925008f01aa	If both your TV and computer have an "s-video" jack, then just plug an S-video cable into each jack.  Then on your TV change the settings to tune into the S-video input.  On your comptuer you may need to go into the Control Panel > Display Settings and configure it to display on 2 monitors (though one is a TV screen.)    The picture quality is great for watching movies, but text will appear way too fuzzy.  TVs do not make good monitors.|`|AA11666968	I can't think of any way of accomplishing what you're trying to do without buying a display card with the necessary output jack.

The tools you need are as follows.  Acouple of screwdrivers a crowbar,  a tire iron,  and my favorite a hammer.  First thing you must do is turn off the power to your pc and move it out to the center of the room.  The second thing you will need to do is take your tire iron and screwdrivers and pry open the tower.  Dont be gentle when doing this, the computer wont die that easy.  After that is done you will need to take your screw driver and hammer and start pounding new codes on your hard drive.  dont be gentle when doing this, nothing will go wrong when doing this process.  After that is done take your hammer and gently tap your mother board to make sure it is in working order.  After that is done you need to check your video and sound cards.  Take your tire iron and hammer and hit them with mild force.  After that is done put your tower back together by pounding the cover back on with your hammer with alot of force.  There you go your done and you have the codes for your problem on your hard drive.  Problem solved have fun.

585e0ecbe8ecbcd310854d29069d418caa	Well, for a rookie, I'd suggest Ubuntu. A lot of people like it and its based on Debian which kind of makes some things easier I think.    The one thing that makes it easier is that to install new programs, you can use a gui program that searches, downloads, and installs the programs you want. And it also worries about the dependencies for you.    While you may be used to the system where you need to find and download and install software yourself, Linux is a little different and you would need to learn the cadence of ./configure, make, make install. It's not hard, but different.     Ubuntu is easier. If you want to move on from that for any reason, or try something else, I'd suggest Fedora next.|`|AA11524967	Ubuntu if you want to stay on with Linux on a desktop  Mandriva/Suse is equally good and may offer compatibility with your laptop     DSL (Damn small Linux) if you want to try a live CD/ USB drive based OS is a good option|`|31413e41c99b1a67f47c857fcf63359baa	The easiest way is to try it out.

The steps are:    1. Developing the program logic to solve the  particular problem.    2. Writing the program logic in a specific  programming language (coding the program).    3. Assembling or compiling the program to turn  it into machine language.    4. Testing and debugging the program.    5. Preparing the necessary documentation.    The logic is generally the most difficult part of programming. However, depending on the programming language, writing the statements may also be laborious. One thing is certain. Documenting the program is considered the most annoying activity by most programmers.|`|437269592dc9971abd7ae89c0c6425c1aa	the answer provided by jaspal.php.d is right-on, esp the part about hating documenting the program you have written unless, of course, you are "the application enhancer" ME.     Some of the best programming languages , PL/I, PASCAL, C++, etc are very akin to using high school algebra, in their expressions, ie the way you write the code. So if you kinda liked using algebra and have the personality to work behind a desk most of the day and are somewhat cebral then you would probably like programming. the career has 2 general paths: remain a techie or become a manager and climb the corporate ladder.    The older mainframe languages like PL/I, PASCAL, COBOL, ASSEMBLER are tedious to use because you must write a lot of code to perform even a non-unique routine for your  program. However, the modern languages come with built-in toolkits which provide canned generized routines for you to use that are already written and built-into the modern language. back in the day, Assembler had 'macros' and all the old languages had the concept of 'calling' from within your program an external toolkit routine to use within your program. the concept was to LINK TO or CALL the external routine from your program and pass it data from your program, let the external routine ie program do its thing and pass its result back to you.    I once ran into a guy who had worked for a city's utility company using a mainframe which had a very robust "link-to" library of about 3000 canned routines. now-a-days that same amount of routines would be included with most any PC language thereby making coding quicker and easier.    then there are the fourth generation languages (4GLs) and 4GL applications such a UFO (user files online, for which I personally provided patches (fixes). a 4GL language is a non-coding program language used to build an application and likewise a 4GL application is a non-code application builder. UFO was a 4GL ONLINE application builder that would be used instead of a product like IBM's CICS (customer information control system) to create in-house online applications. interesting enough, UFO was a CICS built application written in IBM Assembler. NEET HUH!    I liken writing code to creating a well thought out mechanical device except that instead of it being fashioned by your hands and therefore 'hard', instead its molded by your mind and therefore 'soft'.     how's that for DOCUMENTATION.    Hope this helps. if you have more questions i'll try to answer. but i dont know how to keep track of you and just your questions being posted. i quess there is probably a way to do this using q&a. i will have to post a question myself on this. i just started using this q&a forum and it's the first one i've tried.

Here's how to change:    1) open Windows Explorer:  Start, Programs, Accessories, Windows Explorere  2) Click Tools, choose Folder options  3) Click tab on top that is labeled "File Types"  4) Scroll down to see if ".WYZ" is registered.  5) If it is listed, click "Change" and assign MS Excel  6) If it is not listed, click "Add" and assign MS Excel    Hope this helps.

It's an INTERNAL SPECIAL WORD that has a special meaning to DOS.  It means the CONsole, or screen.  If a folder were named CON, DOS and/or Windows could easily become confused when commands are issued using this.  Then it wouldn't know whether you wanted to do something with your folder or the console.   That's why it's reserved.|`|AA11267491	I don't think you can.

DOS drivers are accesible as normal files. CON in Windows is /dev/tty in Unix, NUL is /dev/null, COM  is /dev/ttyS , LPT  is /dev/lp  and CLOCK$ is /dev/rtc (PRN is an alias for LPT1, AUX is COM1).    Still, you can create a CON folder, but this is the only way:    (a) start -> run -> "cmd"  (b) type "mkdir \\.\c:\con"  (c) verify by typing "dir \\.\c:\con"  (d) delete the file or folder "rmdir \\.\c:\con" (only do this after you do step one til three).

Microsoft is offering a variety of options to customers who unknowingly purchased a counterfeit copy of Windows XP. Customers can submit a proof of purchase, the original counterfeit CD, and fill out a report with the details of the purchase and Microsoft will give the customer a complimentary copy of Windows XP. However only high-quality counterfeit Windows versions will qualify for this copy.     For customers who received a computer from a friend, off the Internet or another way and an illegal version was installed, the only option is to buy a fully licensed version. Microsoft is offering the Windows XP Home Edition license kit for $99.00 to customers, while the XP Pro Edition is $149.00. The Windows Genuine Advantage Kit for Windows XP will include a new 25-character Product Key and a Windows Product Key Update tool that will allow customers to convert their counterfeit copy to genuine Windows XP electronically.     The other option is of course to buy a legal version of Windows XP off the Internet or in a retail store. Generally the prices for these versions will be more than the price Microsoft is offering for their Windows Genuine Advantage Kit. Although there are some internet sites like Newegg.com, greatsoftwaredeals.com or edirectsoftware.com that have great prices.    Remember though, if you purchase an OEM or full edition of Windows XP, you'll have to format and reinstall your operating system. You can however purchase an Upgrade edition and change a pirated version to a fully licensed version. Just be sure you have a previous version of Windows (95,98,ME) in case you need to completely reinstall Windows XP someday. Also one other note, if you currently have XP Pro (pirated), you'll need to purchase the XP Pro Upgrade to upgrade your system. XP Home can only upgrade the Home Edition, where XP Pro can upgrade both the Home and Pro versions. Hopefully, that's clear enough to understand.     The other option of course is to go through Microsoft's site and purchase a software key. They will send you a program to upgrade the counterfeit version to a legit version.|`|bf8c5eed7bdf39f6b177580ddc1e3e3daa	A blog is how a loser with no friends or life whines to people on the internet about how much their non-existent life sucks.|`|111ed31fe8bd698494cb364aa271913daa	its lyk an online diary u totally customize. place posts on every day, read comments left by veiwers, let urself be heard worldwide!!!! a good place to start is www.blogger.com I've got a blog with them, free and easy to use.  happy blogging!|`|a97ef86751a8da88628994945c590653aa	A blog is basically an online journal to express your thoughts..updated regulary.

Per esempio io ho una connessione internet ad interfree ed il mio account  nomecognome@interfree.it. Farsi un account  fascile si fa gratuitamente in lenea.  Quando fai la registrazione, in linea, stai ben attenta a stampare tutte le pagine che riguardano il tuo nome utente, le configurazioni e tutto quello che poi ti servir, perch finita la registrazione e chiusa la pagina, addio.  A questo punto  si apre outlook, si scegle il men "strumenti", account nuovo account, e si incominciano a compilare tutti i campi che servono (che sono quelli che hai stampato prima durante la registrazione). Poi in propiet dell'account metti un segno di spunta per far si che lui sia "incluso" per la ricezione della posta. A questo punto il gioco  fatto ogni volta che apri outlook se hai messaggi di posta nella tua casella, dalla web mail ti verranno direttamente "consegnati" su out look e di li puoi rispondere, .

Choose SUM(Above).  This will add all the cell values.  The formula will look like this: {=SUM(ABOVE)}    2) Using same WORD table, copy the numbers to a different column and try inserting a new formula.  This time choose a formula from the formula list.  I recommend AVERAGE.  Then the formula looks like this {AVERAGE(BELOW)}.    To view the formulae described above, highlight the result cell, right click, choose toggle field codes.  Repeat to return it to result.    For auto-text:    1) Click INSERT, choose, AutoText, then choose which you want to use.  I presume that page numbering is probably most commonly used.

AA12341420	Well, like you said - allofmp3.com is the cheapest, but no one's completely sure whether it's legal or not.  They're based in Russia, I believe and seem to get away with selling mp3 songs at dirt cheap because the RIAA can't get to them there and Russia's laws are loose or vague.    After them, eMusic is fairly priced and you can get unprotected mp3s from them.  Then $0.99 a song is pretty much industry standard, but whatever you buy is DRM protected.  There's nothing as cheap (even close) to allofmp3.com.|`|2db1770977cd3ca235973435e1ec5b74aa	download ares galaxy and all would be free|`|AA11647503	well if u want to download songs to an mp3 player (not and ipod) then use yahoo! unlimited its 5bucks a month for an unlimited amount of songs... you dont need to buy them unless you are going to make a cd out of the songs.... well at least that i use and my sister boyfriends uses and my sister it works great give it try|`|AA11018224	Better use Yahoo Music engine,most of the latest songs are  starts from $0.99cents.Same way Microsoft -MSN also offered songs for downloads,Apple and some other \s also offer some free music down loads.If you are a user of pod you can one song every week free of cost.No matter where you are in the world.

No hace falta ser religioso o familiar para ser hermanos. Todos somos hermanos(as) en Cristo.    Contestanto tu pregunta sobre la punta del ratn:  Yo pienso que debe de ser para un mejor control sobre los objetos en tu pantalla. Por ejemplo, si colocas la punta del raton sobre la esquina superior izquierda, veras que se adapta perfectamente a esa esquina. Imaginate ahora si la punta del raton fuera completamente vertical. ?Te imaginas lo tedioso o raro que sentirias si quisieras seleccionar una imagen que empezara desde esa esquina hasta la esquina de la parte inferior derecha?. Si intentas ir mas alla de la esquina superior izquierda notars que no se puede, por lo tanto, no podrias seleccionar una imagen de tal magnitud, puesto que la punta de dicha flecha le indica a tu computadora las coordenadas (x, y) en las cuales se encuentra apuntando el usuario.

Questa impostazione di default implica ovviamente un ritardo nel trasferimento dei dati da periferica USB a PC (in quanto il sistema operativo controlla continuamente lo stato della porta USB per vedere se sei in procinto di disattivarla). Nel computer che hai utilizzato l'ultima volta per trasferire i tuoi dati USB probabilmente non vi era l'impostazione RIMOZIONE VELOCE DELL'HARDWARE oppure sei stato un lampo nel rimuovere la penna dal PC. Questo vuol dire che se il computer in quel momento stava scrivendo nella Tabella di Allocazione File l'indirizzo dell'ultimo file in corso di copiatura e questo  stato improvvisamente interrotto (dalla velocit della tua mano) la presente tabella termina con dei caratteri errati. Quello che ha fatto il S.O. quando hai inserito nuovamente la penna  stato quello di creare una nuova File Allocation Table vuota (poich non ha saputo ricostruire e ripristinare la precedente). Se tu pertanto non hai scritto ancora nessun file sulla periferica USB tutti i dati sono ancora all'interno, e non hai quindi perso neppure un file, tranne quello che stavi ricopiando! Per recuperarlo esistono diversi software (alcuni in prova, altri gratuiti, altri a pagamento): quello che ti consiglio io, in quanto ha un'interfaccia che potrebbe utilizzare anche un bambino  Ontrack EasyRecovery Professional, facile da trovare peraltro nei negozi o scaricabile a pagamento :-D da internet. Ovviamente dovrai utilizzare un FormatRecovery dato che la tua tabella di allocazione file  stata ricreata ovvero come se ci avesso fatto una formattazione.

Visto che spesso il cd del sistema non li forniscono, consiglierei di utilizzare qualche strumento tipo PartitionMagic sotto windows. Sarebbe meglio che tu lo formattassi da capo, ma se hai dati importati, lascia stare. Informati se i cd di ripristino sono cancellano tutte le partizioni(di solito no). Se  cos sposta i dati importanti sulla partizione "sicura" o masterizzali. Dopo (per me  cos) basta che ripristini il sistema con i cd che ti danno. Se invece hai i dischi di windows, fai pure come ti spiegato Paolo B. Io comunque rimango dell'idea che Linux  bello, ma solo sotto macchina virtuale o computer pulito. Non mi piace la convivenza di 2 sistemi operativi (guarda che sono un fan di Ubuntu!).

Da Du ja auch mit Strg+Alt+Entf ins Internet gekommen bist, versuch mal folgendes:    - STRG+Alt+Ent drcken  - im unteren Bereich des sich ?ffnenden Fensters (Task-Manager) auf "Neuer Task.." klicken  - in dem sich ?ffnenden Fenster "explorer" eingeben  - mit "ok" best?tigen    Viel Erfolg      Nachtrag    0,5 Sekunden..... schon besser als nichts .... ist halt was fr schnelle Finger... :-))    Dann versuch folgendes:    - Strg+Alt+Entf. drcken  - Reiterleiste "Prozesse" w?hlen  - in dem Fenster nach "explorer.exe" suchen und mit linker Maustaste markieren  - unter dem Fenster "Prozess beenden" w?hlen  - in der Liste nachsehen, ob noch ein Prozess "explorer.exe" l?uft  - falls ja, den auch beenden  - dann wieder in Reiterleiste "Anwendungen" wechseln - neuer task - explorer.exe starten (wie oben)    Wenn das auch nicht hilft, f?llt mir per "Ferndiagnose" eigentlich nur noch ein evtl. besch?digtes Benutzerprofil ein. Um das zu testen, msstest Du einen neuen Benutzer anlegen, damit ein Standardprofil erstellt wird, und Dich dann mit dem Benutzer anmelden und sehen, was passiert.    - Windows-Taste + E ?ffnet den Arbeitplatz  - dort "Systemsteuerung" ausw?hlen  - "Benutzerkonten" ausw?hlen  - "neues Konto erstellen ausw?hlen"  - Neuen Benutzernamen eintragen und die folgenden Fenster best?tigen  - Strg+Alt+Entf drcken  - in der Menleiste "Herunterfahren" ausw?hlen  - ""xxx" abmelden" ausw?hlen  - dann mit dem neu erstellten Benutzer anmelden    (bei der Anmeldung wird dann ein neues Profil fr den erstellten Benutzer angelegt..... vielleicht funktioniert das...)    Wenn das auch nicht hilft, hast Du Dir irgend etwas "eingefangen" oder installiert, dass den Explorer am Starten hindert.   Dies ist dann per Ferndiagnose sehr schlecht zu beheben.

0199ffbf2e6166cf58216c6925008f01aa	The X in AJAX is for XML.  Data in an AJAX transaction is in XML format.    AJAX allows the client to communicate with the server without a postback (reloading the page).    XML and AJAX aren't specific to the ASP.NET language.|`|daed7e2d70a08a77c340c4b21e914b72aa	Its actually pretty simple. Ajax allows your web applications to change small sections of a page without reloading the entire page.  This allows pages to load faster (after the first load), and make a web application feel like a computer application.     The XML part of Ajax is just a way to carry the data from whatever back end system you are using (doesn't have to be ASP; I do most of my work in PHP) to the front end (Javascript).  For really simple apps (changing the content of a page based on a link click for example) it is just as easy to send back the raw HTML to the Ajax script as it is to send XML.|`|AA10002884	First of all, this isn't limited to ASP.NET. It can be for PHP, JSP, etc.    Ajax, Asynchronous Javascript And XML, is a technique in which you can call a server-side script, from the client-side (javascript) and have data/text/information returned to you. It can be returned in Text, JSON, XML. Then, again on the client-side using javascript, you can dynamically add/update information based on your return data. This prevents having to refresh/reload an entire page, only what is necessary.    As for XML, it is just a standard in which to transmit information.    See the source lists, for more information.|`|7b41e57aff6709972fd8abb99a8be026aa	asp stands for active server pages. it fors websites w/ login, message boards, chat rooms, or stories that have to react off of a database. if u look at the extensions of most websites its asp

Windows Server (NT, 2000, 2003) allow many more concurrent connections.  Windows Server has better tools for running a server, supporting large disks, RAID, etc.    Windows NT predates Windows 95, so it's incredibly obsolete.|`|5224ddea4198f584cbde8867f0de3c96aa	The biggest feature of NT 4.0 Server - important distinction - is that it has a very small footprint on the hard drive. It will carry more than 10 concurrent connections - that figure is for NT 4.0 workstation when being used as a "server".     NT 4.0 Server can run on a slower computer with less memory, ect, while 2000 Server will require considerably more system resources.    Also, 2000 is more "up to date" and you are less likely to run into compatibility problems.    These are a few of many differences. I would look on the   www.microsoft.com site. It is beyond a doubt the most complete reference for their operating systems, and the most accurate.|`|eec730788eb59cfd45b6ca0c04e287ebaa	Windows NT 4.0 does NOT predate Windows 95, nor is it limited to 10 connections. Ignore that last posting.     The newer versions of Windows Server (2000 and 2003) are still based on the NT concept with some improvements and added security features. The biggest change is probably the Active Directory structure.    More importantly Microsoft has discontinued support for Windows NT.

If you do not have the instructions, you could look it up online with the manufacturer (e.g Netgear or Linksys) and model number.  In the instructions look up the parts on how to set up WEP (wireless encryption).  It is really simple.  Basically you will need to click a box to enable WEP then enter a password.  You will need to do this both on the wireless access point and your computer's wireless card configuration.  This basically is like putting a padlock to secure something.  It is a good thing to have and will deter people from using you as a "sweet spot".|`|AA10093905	When you purchase a wireless router, instruction manual comes with it, it tells you security encryption, so that no one else can use it.|`|9b2f6e02113dc310e785a170d2eda668aa	Good luck - you can't get a step by step without telling us what kind of router you have - INCLUDING model.

What application is this for?|`|e76539c4e5af0b008ab44ad840fdd40baa	A network topology is the pattern of links connecting pairs of nodes of a network. It's the shape of a LAN or other communications system. A given node has one or more links to others, and the links can appear in a variety of different shapes. The simplest connection is a one-way link between two devices. A second return link can be added for two-way communication. Modern communications cables usually include more than one wire in order to facilitate this, although very simple bus-based networks have two-way communication on a single wire.    Network topology is determined only by the configuration of connections between nodes; it is therefore a part of graph theory. Distances between nodes, physical interconnections, transmission rates, and/or signal types are not a matter of network topology, although they may be affected by it in an actual physical network.    Read about Network Topologies at the link|`|08c1e15228b31e8ce38f4fb3478c95f4aa	Star topology,bus topology,ring topology are some of the topologies   used in networking.|`|AA11477882	I think the most commonly used one today would be the star topology, i believe it's most practical in general.

Modem stands for modulator/demodulator. Conversion is necessary because telephone lines were initially designed to handle the analog nature of the human voice, not data.     The speed at which a modem transmits data is measured in units called bits per second or bps. The first modems ran at even less than 300 bps. Now 1200, 2400, and 9600 bps modems are considered slow. The faster models reach speeds of 14,400 and 28,800 bps. The faster the modem, the faster the data (for example, images from the Web) appear. Even a 28,800 bps modem, however, cannot compare to the several million bps speed that a campus Ethernet connection gives you.

f9e770ce7acedfbe26ea2888a0df7103aa	A modern Internet e-mail address (using SMTP or Usenet) is   a string of the form jsmith@example.com. It should be read   as "jsmith at example dot com". The part before the @ sign   is the local-part of the address, often the username of the recipient, and the part after the @ sign is a domain name whi  -ch can be looked up in the Domain Name System to find the Mail transfer agent or Mail eXchangers (MXs) accepting e-mail  for that address.Addresses found in the headers of e-mail   should not be considered authoritative, because SMTP has no generally required mechanisms for authentication.

But if you want to do this, start with this information:    Network Bridge overview    Network Bridge provides an inexpensive and easy way to connect local area network (LAN) segments. A LAN segment is a single section of network media that connects computers. For example, suppose you have three computers: computer A, computer B, and computer C. Computer A has two Ethernet network adapters, and computers B and C have one Ethernet network adapter each. An Ethernet cable connecting A to B creates one LAN segment. Another Ethernet cable connecting A to C creates another LAN segment.     Traditionally, if you want a network with more than one segment, you have two options: routing or bridging. IP routing is a common solution for connecting network segments. However, to set up IP routing you either must buy hardware routers or set up the computers at the junctions between segments to operate as routers. IP routing requires difficult IP addressing configuration for each computer on each network segment, and each network segment must be configured as a separate subnet. IP routing is a good solution for large networks, where scalability is important, and where there is an experienced staff to configure and maintain the network. A bridge does not require difficult configurations, but you must purchase additional hardware bridges. Neither of these options are ideal if you have a home or small office network, do not want to purchase expensive bridging hardware, and do not have experienced staff to administer an IP routing network.     With Network Bridge, you can connect LAN segments by selecting the appropriate network connection icons and clicking Bridge Connections. Equally easily, you can enable the bridge and add connections to it. The network bridge manages your network segments and creates a single subnet for the entire network. There is no configuration required, and you do not need to purchase additional hardware such as routers or bridges. IP addressing, address allocation, and name resolution is easy to do in a single subnet IP network.     The network bridge can create connections between different types of network media. In a traditional network, if you are using mixed media types you need a separate subnet for each type of media, and packet forwarding is required for each one of the network's multiple subnets. Packet forwarding is required because different protocols are used for different types of media. Network Bridge automates the configuration required to forward information from one type of media to another.     Only one bridge can exist on a computer running Windows XP, but you can use it to bridge as many network connections as the computer can physically accommodate. For information about creating a network bridge, see Bridge Connections.     Spanning tree algorithm    Network Bridge uses the IEEE spanning tree algorithm (STA) to establish a loop-free forwarding topology. When there are multiple paths in a bridged network, loops can form and the simple forwarding rules of a bridge can cause forwarding storms, a condition in which the same frame is relayed endlessly from one bridge to another. STA provides an automated mechanism to selectively disable bridge forwarding on individual ports as necessary to ensure that the forwarding topology is loop-free. You do not need to configure Network Bridge for the spanning tree algorithm.       In todays world a Wireless Home network is best and not that expensive. Just know there are security and safe issues you need to be aware of.    There is a lot to doing this in order to do it right. I highly recommend Linksys hardware.     Using Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G Router Setup    Basic Diagram:    +--------+  |High     |  |Speed  |  |Modem|  +--------+       |  +----------+  |Linksys   |   +------+  |WRT54G|->|PC-A|  |Router    |   +------+  +----------+       |  +------+  |PC-B |  +------+    Setup Procedures:    Before you start you will need some important information!!!

This means integrated graphics. While the Radeon Xpress 200 may have a small amount of built-in memory (unlike Intel integrated graphics), it will still be borrowing memory from your RAM (the 1024mb) to use for graphics. It may be okay for older games, or games that don't require a lot of 3D, but newer games might be pretty slow. Almost any dedicated graphics card would provide better performance in games. A decent graphics card should be available for as little as $100. (Less if you're willing to use an older and/or lower-end card.)

For example,consider the database to store student records.In DBMS,all details like name,roll,marks,street,city ,state,phone will be stored in a single table.But in Rdbms,the database is splitted something like the name,marks,roll under the 'student details' table and the street,city,state,phone under the 'Contacts' table.Any information to be obtained is done by the properly relating  the 'student details' and 'contacts' tables.DBMS offers a very limited scope for data retrieval using queries when compared to Rdbms.Examples of Rdbms-Oracle,MS-Access.

Try changing that 20px part.    One other note: I would consider replacing your hard-coded IP addresses with a domain name since your IP may change at some point.  If you have a static IP, then it probably doesn't matter.  Plus you save a DNS lookup :-)

MSSQL is Microsoft's expensive database program.|`|9b2f6e02113dc310e785a170d2eda668aa	SQL, as noted by others stands for Structured Query Language.  There are MANY databases available that use SQL, including:    *MySQL  *Microsoft SQL (which includes the FREE MSDE/SQL Express and the EXPENSIVE SQL Server 2000/2005)  *IBM's DB2  *Oracle  *PostgreSQL  *Informix    All the above (and some others) support SQL, however, they often use their own dialect.  Just like people in the USA, Australia, and Britain all speak english, each is a dialect of english.  For example, in Britain (and maybe Australia) people commonly use the word "Lift" for "Elevator", which is used in the united states.  Well, SQL has variations as well.  For example, using Microsoft SQL, if you wanted to retrieve ALL fields of the first 5 records by last name, you would use:  SELECT TOP 5 * FROM TableName ORDER BY LastNameField    But using MySQL, you would say:  SELECT * FROM TableName LIMIT 5 ORDER BY LastNameField    As you can see, they are similar, but different - MSSQL would not understand LIMIT while MySQL would not understand TOP.|`|AA10041448	SQL is Structured Query Language    MySQL is the name for one SQL manufacturer's product.|`|f7ff1852ce251f5b03f528fdf133ae6faa	SQL and mySQL has same set of everything.

Now:  It is possible that you didn't connect the card properly (didn't "click" completely") so there was a short-circuit/spark and something has definitely "died".  Do you have another card to plug-in and try?

RJ-45 cables (also called ethernet cables, cat5 or cat6 cables or patch cables) come in two types: straight-through and cross-over.   A cross-over cable is called that because the 8 individual strands inside the cable are put in the reverse order at one end compared to the other.   This is only used in special situations such as connecting two PCs' ethernet ports directly together, and in the past when connecting network hubs to each other.    If I can assume that your reference to an 'RJ45 cross cable' means a cross-over cable, then the answer is 'no'; if it's a normal straight-through cable then yes (provided you've some form of network hub/switch/router which is itself connected to the internet in some way!).    It should say clearly on the plastic whether or not it's a crossover or straight through

c83bdb2fcdb62c5d54606661b6ee483baa	Definitions:    (a) DMA = Direct Memory Access, where a peripheral sends data direct to "MAIN MEMORY", bypassing the CPU.    (b) Main Memory i.e. RAM (Random Access Memory): It is a type of data store used in computers that allows the stored data to be accessed in any order. RAM in a computer is considered main memory or primary storage: the working area used for  LOADING,  DISPLAYING and MANIPULATING APPLICATIONS & DATA.  ______________________________________...  Coming back to the question    1. HDD and Optical drive support DMA as well as UDMA operations.  (UDMA = Ultra DMA mode)    2. FDD is a popular example for DMA    3. PSU, CPU Fan, Power Button don't need the MAIN MEMORY, so no question of DMA over here.    Explanation for 3:  (i) PSU = Power Supply Unit doesn't need the RAM since supplying power to Motherboard and other drives doesn't have any relation with the RAM.  (ii) CPU FAN is controlled by the motherboard (it depends upon the usage of the CPU; if the temprature is high it may run faster or if CPU usage is low it may slow down)  (iii) Power Button in old computers (AT form factor) was just another ON-OFF button i.e. either O or 1.  In ATX form factors, it is little more automatic. But again, its motherboard controlling it, no RAM involvement.    Hence, i'll say that PSU, POWER SW and CPU FAN don't use DMA  ______________________________________...  Please correct me if I am wrong anywhere... :)|`|42c1a337017d6f43964a7e568c1b5478aa	far as I know, the only one that does is the cd,    hard drive and floppy use irq's    powerbutton,  power supply , and fan don't use motherboard resources

Usually while buying service your ISP offers some theoretical speeds lat say   3 mbps (mega bytes per second) downstream speed  1 mbps  upload speed.    Factual speed of connection however usually varies during day and is depended from general traffic on Internet eventually some local troubles as for instance some ISPs servers down.    To make analogy to water pipe, width of pipe determines how fast you can transfer water through it. Wider the connecting pipe the more water can flow through it and less time it will take to fill let say bucket than from narrow pipe.

You dont need a core duo or a dual core prossessor. All they do is give muti tasking users an extra boost. Windows is design to use one core/prossessor for every action or group. As in other words.

If the service was running at full speed you would get 1 megabyte (which is 8 megabits), which is only 100KB more than you seem to be getting.    The two factors here are firstly that the speed test is probably telling you the speed in kiloBYTES not kiloBITS and the speed from your ISP is measure in megaBITS.  The difference is a factor of 8.    At that rate of 900 kiloBYTES, that would be 7.2 megaBITS per second, which is a very good speed.  You must be very near your exchange.    The second factor is that the service can be anything between 2Mbits and 8Mbits because it depends on your distance from the exchange.  It's not a guaranteed speed.  Most people on an 'up to' 8Mbit service get between 4Mbits and 6Mbits per second.    I hope that helps explain it.  Don't be disheartened - you're getting a very good speed!

0199ffbf2e6166cf58216c6925008f01aa	Web servers are usually public-facing website servers whereas app servers are usually inside the firewall and serve apps to local users.|`|50e362ae82fc0f80c3bfb53ce68d10f5aa	The Web server  A Web server handles the HTTP protocol. When the Web server receives an HTTP request, it responds with an HTTP response, such as sending back an HTML page. To process a request, a Web server may respond with a static HTML page or image, send a redirect, or delegate the dynamic response generation to some other program such as CGI scripts, JSPs (JavaServer Pages), servlets, ASPs (Active Server Pages), server-side JavaScripts, or some other server-side technology. Whatever their purpose, such server-side programs generate a response, most often in HTML, for viewing in a Web browser.     Understand that a Web server's delegation model is fairly simple. When a request comes into the Web server, the Web server simply passes the request to the program best able to handle it. The Web server doesn't provide any functionality beyond simply providing an environment in which the server-side program can execute and pass back the generated responses. The server-side program usually provides for itself such functions as transaction processing, database connectivity, and messaging.     While a Web server may not itself support transactions or database connection pooling, it may employ various strategies for fault tolerance and scalability such as load balancing, caching, and clusteringfeatures oftentimes erroneously assigned as features reserved only for application servers.     The application server  As for the application server, according to our definition, an application server exposes business logic to client applications through various protocols, possibly including HTTP. While a Web server mainly deals with sending HTML for display in a Web browser, an application server provides access to business logic for use by client application programs. The application program can use this logic just as it would call a method on an object (or a function in the procedural world).     Such application server clients can include GUIs (graphical user interface) running on a PC, a Web server, or even other application servers. The information traveling back and forth between an application server and its client is not restricted to simple display markup. Instead, the information is program logic. Since the logic takes the form of data and method calls and not static HTML, the client can employ the exposed business logic however it wants.     In most cases, the server exposes this business logic through a component API, such as the EJB (Enterprise JavaBean) component model found on J2EE (Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition) application servers. Moreover, the application server manages its own resources. Such gate-keeping duties include security, transaction processing, resource pooling, and messaging. Like a Web server, an application server may also employ various scalability and fault-tolerance techniques.      An example  As an example, consider an online store that provides real-time pricing and availability information. Most likely, the site will provide a form with which you can choose a product. When you submit your query, the site performs a lookup and returns the results embedded within an HTML page. The site may implement this functionality in numerous ways. I'll show you one scenario that doesn't use an application server and another that does. Seeing how these scenarios differ will help you to see the application server's function.     Scenario 1: Web server without an application server  In the first scenario, a Web server alone provides the online store's functionality. The Web server takes your request, then passes it to a server-side program able to handle the request. The server-side program looks up the pricing information from a database or a flat file. Once retrieved, the server-side program uses the information to formulate the HTML response, then the Web server sends it back to your Web browser.     To summarize, a Web server simply processes HTTP requests by responding with HTML pages.    Scenario 2: Web server with an application server  Scenario 2 resembles Scenario 1 in that the Web server still delegates the response generation to a script. However, you can now put the business logic for the pricing lookup onto an application server. With that change, instead of the script knowing how to look up the data and formulate a response, the script can simply call the application server's lookup service. The script can then use the service's result when the script generates its HTML response.     In this scenario, the application server serves the business logic for looking up a product's pricing information. That functionality doesn't say anything about display or how the client must use the information. Instead, the client and application server send data back and forth. When a client calls the application server's lookup service, the service simply looks up the information and returns it to the client.     By separating the pricing logic from the HTML response-generating code, the pricing logic becomes far more reusable between applications. A second client, such as a cash register, could also call the same service as a clerk checks out a customer. In contrast, in Scenario 1 the pricing lookup service is not reusable because the information is embedded within the HTML page. To summarize, in Scenario 2's model, the Web server handles HTTP requests by replying with an HTML page while the application server serves application logic by processing pricing and availability requests.     Caveats  Recently, XML Web services have blurred the line between application servers and Web servers. By passing an XML payload to a Web server, the Web server can now process the data and respond much as application servers have in the past.     Additionally, most application servers also contain a Web server, meaning you can consider a Web server a subset of an |`|AA11359967	application server has all the s/w and database of your product,  web server connects the internet securely.|`|af045a81874f09bbe3a387f00c4bbf4aaa	A web server (also called HTTP server) only serves HTTP request on port 80 (like apache, IIS) whereas an application server can serve application request from sent by a webserver.     for instance PHP, JSP, ASP.NET and ASP are example of application request which HTTP Server/web server pass on to the Application server to handle. In turn, the app server will process it, generate HTML result and hands it off back to web server to send to the browser.     So web server can receive an HTTP request and send out HTML result back to the browser    I hope this helps

Cable Internet technology allows for transfer rates as high as 30Mbps (megabits per second, or 30 million bits per second; contrast that to phone modems at 56 thousand bits per second). However, that bandwidth is commonly divided up among all subscribers in a defined area, such as a neighborhood or a subdivision. Because of this, real world transfer rates are anywhere from 256Kbps to 4Mbps. The most common way to link to the cable modem is through an Ethernet 10BASE-T connection.     The term "cable modem" implies that it functions like a plain old telephone modem. This is not the case. A cable modem Internet connection is always on. You don't dial up anymore; just having the computer turned on is enough to be connected. Most users familiar with Ethernet should treat a computer connected through a cable modem exactly as they do one connected to an Ethernet network.    Increasingly, things are changing so that a cable modem isn't really a modem any longer; that is, it's not a device that modulates and demodulates a signal between an analog network and a digital end device. For example, a phone modem modulates a digital signal from the computer into an analog signal for the phone lines, and demodulates the analog phone signal into a digital one. The first cable modems did the same thing, except with a cable TV signal. But now, things are changing. Many cable Internet service providers (ISPs) are migrating towards a fully digital network for everything, including their television signals. This means that cable modems on those systems will no longer be modems; they will more properly be called media converters or cable terminal devices (this is the term the cable TV industry says is the proper one).

Introduced in 1995, Fast Ethernet is no longer the fastest form of Ethernet: gigabit Ethernet and the new 10 gigabit Ethernet standards are 10 and 100 times faster, respectively.          Ethernet uses different protocols than does serial communication, and unlike serial devices Ethernet devices are used to move data not acquire it. Thus, while you can ethernet enable your Printer (meaning you use an ethernet hub with a parallel port to which you connect the printer) you will never have and ethernet-based printer, one that plugs directly into the Ethernet port (unless the printer itself contains an Ethernet hub--and such devices are rare and expensive.) However, there are great advantages to being able to access devices that were traditionally accessible only from a single PC.    A serial device server, such as Quatech's ThinQ line, allows individual serial devices such as printers, simple terminals, medical monitoring equipment, CNC machines, etc., that were previously accessible only via a direct link to be accessible from any Internet enabled computer. According to Dataquest, a device server is a "specialized network-based hardware device designed to perform a single or specialized set of functions with client access independent of any operating system or proprietary protocol." In practical terms, this means that by using a serial device server you can connect any serial device to your network by connecting the device to a serial port on the SDS and connecting the Ethernet port on your SDS to your network. Once the connection is made, any PC or dumb terminal can transparently access the device as if it were accessing a native COM port.    a serial port is a serial communication physical interface through which information transfers in or out one bit at a time (contrast parallel port). Throughout most of the history of personal computers, data transfer through serial ports connected the computer to devices such as terminals or modems. Mice, keyboards, and other peripheral devices also connected in this way.    http://www.quatech.com/support/comm-over...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Ethern...  http://computer.howstuffworks.com/serial...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port|`|c2d4376ec546145cbf5b76d91a3de370aa	In computer networking, Fast Ethernet is a collective term for a number of Ethernet standards that carry traffic at the nominal rate of 100 Mbit/s, against the original Ethernet speed of 10 Mbit/s.    Introduced in 1995, Fast Ethernet is no longer the fastest form of Ethernet: gigabit Ethernet and the new 10 gigabit Ethernet standards are 10 and 100 times faster, respectively.    In computing, a serial port is a serial communication physical interface through which information transfers in or out one bit at a time (contrast parallel port). Throughout most of the history of personal computers, data transfer through serial ports connected the computer to devices such as terminals or modems. Mice, keyboards, and other peripheral devices also connected in this way.    While such interfaces as Ethernet, FireWire, and USB all send data as a serial stream, the term "serial port" usually identifies hardware more or less compliant to the RS-232 standard, intended to interface with a modem or with a similar communication device.

In the cells adjacent to the right, key in the numerical value of each letter.  Sort the listing in ascending order after creating the list to be certain it is properly sorted.

AMD has better performance/price ratio(you get more bang for the buck from AMD in that range). As for the high end, currently, it is Intel( for the last three yrs, it was AMD, but that changed last June)    Off course, things could change by mid next year(some say even sooner). There is a 60% chance AMD might win back the high end crown.    With regard to laptops, laptops from AMD with Turion X2 and graphics card from ATI(now owned by AMD) should be able to run Vista w o problems and should allow you to play modern games.    Most of the laptops that have Intel newer chips come with integrated graphics which fail at playing games and also at running Vista graphics.    The performance of the the Turion X 2 is not as strong as that of the Intel chips, but it does offer longer battery life.

There are times when you cant open certain pages or visit particular sites that you were previously able to access. There are several fixes for this type of problem and you only need a starting place and work your way toward the solution to your problem. First of all, every site you visit implants a cookie from that site onto your hard drive, which enables it to load more quickly the next time you visit that site. Unfortunately all cookies eventually get stale and will no longer allow you to access those sites. Once a week or so, you should delete all of the cookies in your system so that they will "refresh" themselves the next time you access those particular sites. "Disk Cleanup" is the best way to accomplish that. It removes all of the old, stale and unused cookies from the "Cache" and  allows you a fresh start. Immediately, you'll notice that your machine speeds up and oporates much better.  2nd. Sometimes when you're downloading programs or tunes from a site, you'll find that some of your "Security" settings have been changed, and often without your knowledge or permission. These changes can also keep you from reaching sites that you normally have no problems accessing. Simply go into your "Control Panel" "Add/remove programs". The 2nd tab at the top of the page is "Security." Click on it and on the next page you'll notice at the top, 4 instances of internet, the first one will already be highlighted for you. Look at the bottom of the page and make sure the Security level isn't set to "Custom". If so, this will prevent you from getting to your sites. To remedy this, click on the "Default Button" which will change it to the proper setting. Then click on "apply." Then highlight the next instance of internet at the top of the page and do the very same thing, click the "Default" button and then on "Apply." Do this for each of the four instances of internet, being sure on the last one to click on "Apply" and then on "Ok." It's important at this stage to restart your computer so that the new changes will take effect. 3rd. You may have a "Popup Blocker" that is keeping you from the sites you're trying to access. You can always disable your popup blocker temporarily to see if this helps. 4th. Last of all, your "Firewall" may be the one blocking you from certain sites. In every Firewall Program, you'll find an area that lets you "allow" or "block" sites. Simply type in the sites that you're having problems reaching and then click on "allow". After listing all of the sites that you frequent, be sure to restart the computer so that the new changes can take effect. Good luck, Larry Radio Shack 019590

When you click the Star icon to display favorites, you are given an option to 'Pin' the Favorites Center by clicking the icon in the top right corner (it has a small green arrow and displays the text "Pin the Favorites Center" when you hover over it with  your mouse).    Once it's Pinned, simply hover your mouse pointer over the border or edge of the Favorites Center until it changes into a black double-ended arrow, click and hold the left mouse button, and drag the center until it is the appropriate size.

If not, try the next one.    1) Turn off your router and then turn it back on.  2) Right click your wireless connection on your laptop, and hit repair. Then wait a few seconds.  3) Drop to DOS. Type "ipconfig /renew". Wait a few seconds.  4) Bring up wireless connections. Get a list of available ones and make sure that you're connecting to your router and not your neighbor's.  5) Bring up your router's page in a web browser (usually you can just type in 192.168.1.1 in the Address line). Find out if it's using WEP security or filtering by MAC address. (If it is, this would have been done intentionally.

6eca371c40835faa53a16f698cd120e3aa	It is a way to improve the rankings of your website on a search engine - e..g if your website is shown on Google on page 25, you optimise your page with meta titles and keywords to get to page 8 (improving your ranking).    Search engine optimization (SEO) is a subset of search engine marketing, and deals with improving the number and/or quality of visitors to a web site.    Search engines display different kinds of listings on a search engine results page (SERP), including paid advertising in the form of pay per click advertisements and paid inclusion listings, as well as unpaid organic search results and keywords specific listings, such as news stories, definitions, map locations, and images. SEO is concerned with improving the number and position of a site's listings in the organic search results.    SEO strategies vary widely, in accordance with the specific site. Broadly speaking, SEO may be geared towards increasing either, or both, the total number and quality of visitors from Search Engines. The quality of a visitor can be measured by how often a visitor using a specific keyword leads to a desired conversion action, such as making a purchase or requesting further information.    Search engine optimization is available as a stand-alone service or as a part of a larger marketing campaign. Because SEO often requires making changes to the source code of a site, it is often most effective when incorporated into the initial development and design of a site, leading to the use of the term "Search Engine Friendly" to describe designs, menus, Content management systems and shopping carts that can be optimized easily and effectively.|`|c0bb7db47873f4c10aec48db6f7c98a4aa	Did it ever occur to you to actually _use_ a search engine to find this out?

Trojan ou Cavalo de Tria  um programa que age como a lenda do cavalo de Tria, entrando no computador, e liberando uma porta para um possvel invasor.    O conceito nasceu de simples programas que se faziam passar por esquemas de autentica??o, em que o utilizador era obrigado a inserir as senhas, pensando que estas opera??es eram legtimas. Por exemplo, na autentica??o de uma shell, poderia ser um simples programa numa conta j aberta, e o utilizador que chegasse seria for?ado a introduzir a seu password. O trojan iria ent?o guardar o password e mascarar a conta (que seria do dono do trojan) para que parecesse legtima (a conta da vtima).

AA12303431	Here are some legal freeware programs to try;    http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/paint.net/  -Paint.net Paint with layers.  http://www.irfanview.com - useful graphics tool  http://www.download.com/Deep-Paint/3000-...  - Deep Paint  http://www.gimp.org - Like Photoshop 7  http://www.inkscape.org - vector image tool with a full manual.  http://www.blender.org - professional 3D rendering software plus manual.    The toucan could have been drawn and scanned in, then tidied up in something like Adobe Photoshop. (its about 500, but brilliant.) Then theres Adobe Illustrator, which is vector based art.   The Gimp is the legal freeware alternative.  The toucan has the look of a drawn pic rather than the totally smooth vector look. You can add that as an effect but its just as easy to draw it and scan it.    The dragon is 3D art, probably something like Maya; again pro software and very expensive. Blender is the freeware version but difficult to learn.|`|AA10140002	Here's a neat program for something you're searching for that would create what you described, though it's not free, it's not that expensive either:  http://www.daz3d.com/
AA10140002	Why not just use HTML and create the form on a webpage, and have the form information sent to you via email using a CGI formmail program script, once they click on the submit button?     Other than that, I believe that you would need to have a full version of the Adobe Acrobat program, have your visitors download the PDF file of your form, fill it out, then save it and resend it back to you. Seems like an awful lot of work to expect your website visitors to do.    If you can't do it with a PDF file, why not just create your questions in a word document file, allow them to download it, fill it out, and send it back. Seems easier (and cheaper) than using a PDF.|`|rTaOOcwNaa	You have to have the full version of acrobat.    I've heard of people being able to take a Word dot file and convert it to pdf like that, but I don't have any experience with that.    Good luck!

Su nombre lo dice: dar formato ha algo. Pero las personas comnmente se refieren a dar formato al Disco Duro,  diskette, CD-RW, DVD-RW, ZIP.... vaya... a cualquier medio de almacenamiento masivo para dar una estructura lgica para leer y escribir datos por el sistema operativo, CON LA CONSECUENCIA QUE PERDERN LOS DATOS guardados anteriormente antes del formato.  Dependiendo de esa estructura del formato; existen dos modos (si se le puede decir as)  - Formato rpido  - Formato Completo    El formato rpido solo prepara el medio de almacenamiento en la "Tabla de asignacin de archivos" (FAT) que es un espacio asignado por ste  para ubicar donde comienza y donde termina un archivo a nivel de bits fsicos y para localizar los espacios vacos o disponibles para guardar informacin.     El formato completo; aparte de dar un formato rpido tambin lo realiza a nivel de bits fsicos por todo el espacio particionado.     La ventaja de uno con respecto del otro, es que el primero todos los datos son recuperables; si ha permanecido intacto y sin uso. y es...vaya... rpido (en cuestion de segundos), mientras que el otro arregla errores en las pistas (en el caso de un Disco Duro) por falta de magnetizacin y otros diversos problemas.

So my answer is different and will give you number of a specific weekday by name.     For this to work, create a column of dates starting in A2 and continue down to A100.    In cell B2, put in this formula: =TEXT(A2,"dddd")    Copy this down in all cells to cell B100.  You should now see the weekday names in those cells.    In Cell C2 put this formula:   =COUNTIF (B2:B100, "Tuesday")     You can change the weekday name as desired or reference another cell with weekday name.

Sometimes companies just inflate the numbers, but others put more power on the +3.3V and +5V rails which don't power the video card, but do power your optical and hard drives. Personally I would choose something with a higher voltage single rail +12V at ~20amps (yours has two +12V rails at 14amps and 15amps), but this power supply will definitely work.

2GwKtnKTaa	Since HTML has been so widely used and works so well (with some weaknesses) I had to wonder what the advantages of using XML are. A few are listed below:        * You can define your own elements and thereby support a much wider variety of information display. XML may be used to describe chemical structures, or other scientific or artistic data that cannot be readily displayed using HTML.      * Documents may be better organized into structures to allow for easier reference using and generating items like a table of contents.      * XML allows elements to be used to sort through database information readily.     Implementations    There are many implementations of XML which utilize their own DTD (Document Type Definition). Many have different purposes such as writing technical documentation, math formulas, sheet music, and so forth. The biggest drawback to these various implementations of XML is that for the most part, it seems that you will need to read the DTD or read documentation about the XML implementation in order to use it. If this is required, it would be like learning HTML for each XML implementation. Therefore there should be supporting programs that allow users to use XML implementations without having to learn each implementation. I think there are some programs that allow users to create XML files for some XML implementations, but I'm not sure which ones provide for this. My prediction is that XML implementations not supported by user friendly programs, will likely fail (and should) fail to become popular.|`|21ae604731b9eb8ea264cc40f292a9ccaa	http://www.xml.com/pub/a/98/10/guide0.ht...|`|f5b69c4fd282252cab421932efc3269faa	extensible markup language  used to business to business  communication  convert object into byte stream|`|e25732a8dbc93e25f7478a65d5d449e8aa	Extensible Markup Language|`|175ed944a42e435ad83b433b846e793eaa	XML or eXtensible Markup Language is used to define diffent sets of data.

Know that also even if you do use a script, if someone really wants a photo, they'll get it - I would suggest as someone also said, to watermark your photo's so that they'll be useless to anyone copying them.    DianeD|`|8f2ef39a743231bcd2f97b8eb66ff1afaa	There's a 'no right click' code here:http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex... that will discourage people, but it is still possible to get the photos if someone really wanted them.    Also, there's a 'no right click' that ONLY works on photos here: http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex... but you'd still have the same issues.|`|AA11803569	um type up in text of the pics on ur site    once you set that up, set up a lil link on that text that takes users to another page in ur site to view that pic.    use a watermarked pic.      -WARNING-  it might discurage users. (might)    but it works

Unless I misunderstood the question and you're asking where to buy a paper someone else wrote.    If that's the case...I have no idea where to buy things like that.  it has been done though. Either way, you'll be cruising a search engine before long.

AA10140002	Well, unless you back up your files, there isn't much you can do. If you performed your editing online, you won't be able to undo anything since you saved and wrote over the old files. As a suggestion for the future, always ALWAYS do a back-up of your files BEFORE you edit them.
wC78NaFqaa	The correct way is:    It does not matter if you use capitals or not.  I don't think that you really need to use this tag but it won't hurt.  Regards, Zyfert  http://xsitepro.cybersprout.com|`|AA10140002	Some MetaTags are unimportant and not even needed. But to answer your question, yes, use the quotes.    http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.a...|`|ae06239e62818780ae57b9ae07468d3caa	No it doesn't matter.  And quotation marks are only necessary when the value has spaces.     For example name=distribution does not need quotation marks.  But name="big distribution" requires quotation marks.
bb3a36268c5ff13be021a8cfd1f1e559aa	Allora se non puoi installare programmi senza l'accesso con pw, procedi con l'inoltro email, nella sezione OPZIONI della tua webmail deve esserci la procedura di inoltro... Inoltra all'account di hotmail....  Oppure chiedi semplicemente all'amministratore di installare un programma, se  facilmente corruttibile.  Non mi sembra il caso di suggerirti di rubare la pw all'amministratore... nascono un sacco di problemi se ti scoprono...  -------------------------  Che account di posta possiedi? perch non fai un inoltro?  Mi spiego, utilizzi come principale l'indirizzo di hotmail, con cui entri in msn messenger. Poi accedi all'altro account, deve esserci la funzione Inoltra le email, Inoltri le email all'account di Hotmail e il gioco  fatto...    senza l'installazione di un altro programma non  possibile. Lo dico perch ho cercato dappertutto su MSN messenger, non  possibile neanche gestire due account hotmail, figurati un account esterno.      ----------------------------------  Ciao, ho trovato questo, spero che possa aiutarti:    Si chiama Messenger!Plus Live, un'estensione (non ufficiale, nel senso non sviluppato da Microsoft ma dagli utenti, un po' come il mod Counter-strike di Hal-life per intenderci). Per tanti ne usano perch ha moltissime funzionalit.  Posto qui il link del programma: http://www.msgpluslive.it/    1) se hai un account di posta Hotmail e un account di posta esterna, scarichi il programma, lo installi. Si configura come MSN Messenger Live per ti permette di aggiungere un account di posta esterna in modalit pop3. Cos puoi controllare il tuo account Hotmail e anche la posta di un altro provider.    2) se hai due account Hotmail,  ancora pi semplice. Messenger Plus permette di aprire due Messenger contemporaneamente quindi in uno entri con un account hotmail e nell'altro messenger l'altro nome utente hotmail. In questo modo hai due messenger, ognuno con il proprio nome utente che ti segnalano quando arriva una nuova posta.    Spero di essere di aiuto, se ci sono problemi fammi sapere.|`|8b637288acbd8af50a62ae331dfea9b7aa	che ci possano essere 2 account  sicuro, che si possano scaricare posta da pi account non saprei, ma penso di s.  Anzi, ho appena verificato ed  possibile!    Se usi thunderbird come programma x la tua posta e l'estensione webmail, puoi utilizzare i 2 account per ricevere la tua posta.|`|0199a486e42f928e4ca70934378cd78eaa	Ciao Fabio,    ho anch'io il tuo "problema". Stavo cercando tra i vari forum ed ho trovato che l'unica possibilit per fare quello che altri danno gratuitamente (aggiungere accounts, scarico su programmi di posta esterni...)  d'iscriversi a pagamento..     Spero d'essere contraddetto. Anch'io ho Yahoo come posta ma anche hotmail, infatti e per leggere la posta ogni volta....    Grazie a te.
3GSeuKzMaa	sata is newer and faster, plus the smaller cable allows for better airflow throughout your case. you should be able to use both if you need too, however before you go out and purchase a sata card, make sure you have the latest sata drivers for your mobo, and preinstall them. some motherboards are picky about booting up for the first time off of a sata drive, so without knowing what kind you have i have to offer you that general advice, although regardless it would be a good thing to do. also make sure in your bios you have sata enabled before you start pulling your hair out. lots of times on older motherboards this option comes pre disabled from the factory, for whatever reason i don't know. also it wouldnt hurt to check with your manufacturer. hope this helps.|`|7bd794308643a48ae46003172864a1f5aa	At the moment there is no real difference, the drives are identical except for the interface. The SATA interface can handle faster speeds than IDE but currently the speed of drives is not limited by the interface. SATA does have some benefits though, the cables are smaller, drives can be hot plugged and new technology will appear in SATA drives first.  You can use both types at the same time without any problems.  You should get SATA because your next motherboard may not support IDE.|`|DNeuIUJsaa	serial ata is faster access and you can in theory have as many hard drives fitted as you like that's the main difference between ide and sata|`|88498c66aa3d8910d38d5eb6e6365941aa	IDE|`|46da555bdbfa16545c7292b5f6a87072aa	SATA is faster.|`|95f86c751d2ca41a831a9719a71abc1eaa	SATA is better, Yes you can use both at the same time.

Only use an Administrative account to install specific software that you have downloaded from a trusted website from your Limited account.    Once your computer has been compromised, even after you have eliminated the spyware you will have to change all your passwords to every account you access via your computer; it's better to assume the spy has all your passwords.    The firewall is an important defense, but in many cases it will not detect the spy's uploading of data, if it is sent as an email or uploaded to a web page, since in most cases you won't want to restrict your access to email or the web.|`|9cc9d1b1db5e5452f3279720cee18e87aa	2 very usefull programs, update and run on a regular bases.  2 things download and run 1 at a time..  http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant...  http://www.superantispyware.com/|`|tJKiKq6xaa	scan it with antispyware malwarebytes|`|dkpIjt5jaa	To search for Malware that COULD be there, deeply rooting itself in your system, try the following steps.  Some nasty ones even hide in your router's firmware. Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    I would suggest getting the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware MAY block you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (spyware).    7) Get a good Virus scanner, I suggest Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).      If you already have a scanner, make sure its virus database is updated BUT do not use AVG free (Too many false positives).      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !      NOTE: If you do not have Spyware/Adware/Malware in your computer, these steps won't harm your machine but it will have made it cleaner and a little zippier in performance so "no loss to you"|`|R7mxReqcaa	I recommend looking up www.lavasoft.com and downloading Ad-Aware, its a free program that will help get rid of that.    If that doesnt do it, check out Spybot Search and Destroy, just search through yahoo, i can't remember the link for that one, its free as well.|`|YlLdIPRvaa	Get Ad-Aware from Lavasoft and run a scan.|`|1WaTRF3Caa	FIRST!!!  Go to a friends/families computer and download Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware    http://www.malwarebytes.org/    Download the program, then RENAME IT (VERY important, lots of spyware will prevent this program from installing). After renaming it, burn it to a CD. Now, goto your computer and restart it. Repeatedly press F8 before windows boots. A menu will come up asking you how you want to boot. Boot into "Safe Mode". Log on as the Administrator and install the program from the CD. After it is installed, run it and do a FULL SCAN of ALL hard-drives. After it is done scanning, remove all problems it finds. Now, shut off your computer. Turn it on again and press F8. This time boot into "Safe Mode with Networking" and log on as the Administrator. After it boots, open Anti-Malware. Connect to the internet and go to the update tab and update the program. Run another FULL SCAN of all hard drives. Repair anything it finds.    Hope this helps!
