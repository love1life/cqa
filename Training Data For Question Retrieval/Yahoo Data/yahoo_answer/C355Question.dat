I think it was a British film, I could be wrong. The movie is about aliens that are discovered while constuction is being done in an underground train station. They first find alien artifacts and a ship (I think). They try to drill through it but cant. The aliens start to take over peoples minds and images are shown of mass amounts of creatures that look like grasshoppers or locusts. Scientists get involved to help. I can see in my head some of the scenes but cant get a name or anything. Ive searched all I can on my PC. Please help. Thanks

Her older sisters knew that she had been murdered by her parents. They ended up going through hypnosis and therapy to forget it but the hypnosis ended up revealing a lot of information. The sisters remembered the color of her dress she was buried in, but each on said a different color (I think one said yellow on said lavender). They ended up digging up her body and testing the fabric of the dress. They found out that both had been right. It had been the one color with the other as, trim, or something. Then the parents (or father or someone) were convicted but they only had to serve like 5 years or something because they used the sentencing from the year she was murdered. I think the little girls name was Caroline but maybe I'm making that up. Please help. I really want to find out what this movie is...and if anyone knows where I could find it, that would be GREAT!

Both Buttafuoco, 53, and Fisher, 32, have been served with divorce papers from their current spouses.       Recent reports suggest that the former lovers are in talks to produce a TV reality show.       Connery said she was initially upset and angry when she heard about them getting together, but she's not surprised. Her ex-husband's motivation, she said, is simple.       "One word: money, money," she said. "Joe has lost everything. He doesn't have a business; he's been in jail more times than I can count. He has nothing. There's nothing in his life, and he's hit rock bottom, and so this is what he does."       The Buttafuocos and Fisher, dubbed the "Long Island Lolita," all gained instant notoriety after the shooting on May 19, 1992, and the details of the affair became public. Drew Barrymore even played Fisher in a made-for-TV movie of the events.       Joey Buttafuoco served time in jail for statutory rape, and Fisher served seven years

20070208083155AAxtoT8	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	I JUST REALIZED the KEY to picking up HOT beautiful women in any RANDOM public SETTING. Read to find out...?	I just realized this, 30 minutes ago, when I got too nervous to go up to a women in the streets of LA, before I got to work. She was so beautiful, but I was so nervous to approach her because I'm a stranger, and I didn't know what to say. I realized the key...and here it is:  Step 1: Glance at her with a smile on your face, and then look away.  Step 2: Ask a VERY RELEVANT question to the SETTING you are in. Example: see a HOT woman at a book store? Ask her "so, whatcha reading?". In the busy sidewalks of LA? So, what kind of work are you in?   Step 3: Ask her for her name. This is a personal thing, but not TOO personal. Now that you know her name, she can't just walk away.  Step 4: NUMB your mind to any type of rejection embarassment, etc. Use the 3 second rule (don't over think for more than 3 seconds), and then   Step 5: Ask her for lunch. Say: I have to get going pretty soon, but, I was wondering...you seem like a really sweet woman...wanna grab lunch sometime?     COMMENTS???

EL:-Tranquila amor, tranquila, duerme que soy yo, mi vida...   ELLA: -Y yo le creía, hasta que un día sin querer descubrí,   Que era todo mentira...

El llegó, yo no dormía, en silencio lo esperaba,   Cuando se acercó a abrazarme, puse fin allí a su vida,   Y vinieron a buscarme, estoy aquí desde aquel día,

Como me ocurre algunas veces, no entend bien el final... cuando la chica que ense?aba a los ****** a no ser ms esclavos, se da por vencida y huye....

Y con  la musica "Young american" de David Bowie. Si alguien me quiere dar una opinin sobre el final y esta parte, ser bienvenido!

He begins to drive with no destination going to places he's never been before, leaving behind lifetime of constellation, love, peace and lots of wars. But when i look through his red eyes, i start to see that he never really moved on. He tries to look through for anything that will make him turn around and go back home, its getting really cold and it was the only place he ever felt the warm, but when i look through his mind, i start to see that he is burning from the core. Why do they keep reminding him? And the same feelings starts to return, and he looks at pictures that he burnt and starts to wish he was never born. Why is it easy to forgive than forgive? And why are we unfair to ourselves, when nothing really matters, nothing can wrong, our hearts will never shatter, like we did before. Go down the road your friend has gone, he is now on top with his fights won. We should start to think like one, but never like before, its now just more right. ALRIGHT PLZ LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU  THINK

20090131131814AAjEhpx	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Next Tomb Raider movie suggestion?	I see all this fuss about choosing an actress for the next Tomb Raider movie....Angelina Jolie's the only actress that fits the role,perfectly.Megan Fox looks to skanky to be Lara,sorry,but she does.We need an actress which looks more classy,since Lara's a British aristocrat.Angie's both exotic enough AND classy looking enough for the role,but she's too busy with her new family life.Plus,the actresses can't pull off Lara's stunts,not even with the doubles they have,because her stunts are very difficult or even impossible.    So,i was thinking,a 3D movie would be great,wouldn't it? It's show us the real Lara as we want her to be and look,the stunts she perfoms,the magic,eerie places she visits as they are in the games exactly as they are 3D....You know,all that.I want a Tomb Raider movie to give me that Tomb Raider feeling i get when playing.    So,what do you think?    Try to be not post anything rude,this is an opinion question.    Thanks.:)

20090131131127AAFOqZU	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Tomboys and sun sign - or applicable placements/aspects?	What sun signs/aspects would make a girl be on the "Tomboyish" side?  I have noticed that Geminis are often tomboys, and that Sags like sports, but also really like to dress up.  I would also think that Aries suns bend this way with their natural need for action.      However, I do believe that the Mars sign (governing sports, competions, and physcial activity) and House V (Recreational and Leisure Activities) accentuate-add to your preferences re sporty-physical activities.        Me:  Scorpio Sun, Leo Mars, Pisces House V.  Not a tomboy.  Swimming was my preference, which to me makes sense, as the Leo in Mars makes me naturally physical, and my Pisces House V wants serenty -- so swimming gives me the physical release, and allows me to go off into dreamland.       Are you/were you on the Tomboyish side, and what's your Sun, Mars, and House V placements?  Or were you very much the opposite, and what's your Sun, Mars, and House V placements?

I haven't the time to track down each issue separately so I have been reading the different x-men series in compilation books and cd's like 40 years of X-Men. The series I really want to find though is the 90's run just titled X-Men, sometimes called Adjectiveless X-Men, and currently renamed X-Men Legacy. Anyone know where I can find this series in a compilation starting from the beginning? Thanks in advance!

20090131123509AAybyzs	Entertainment & Music;Television;Drama	Is it in Angel or Buffy the Vampire Slayer?	Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. I've only seen the whole buffy series, but I've also seen bits and pieces of Angel, so I'm confused. There's two episodes I'm thinking of, and I was wondering if someone could tell me which series I'm thinking of.      So one is when Angel turns mortal for a day, and then at the end of the day time rewinds and buffy forgets everything that happened. Is that one in Buffy or Angel? Which season is it, also?      the second one is when buffy and angel get married. This one I'm not sure happened, but I've seen clips of it somewhere, so I hope it was an actual episode. Again, which series, and which season?       Any help would be very very helpful!

20090131122950AAu7nVO	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	What's a great romance anime with these qualities?	Well first off, I've already watched Kodocha. Pretear, Neo Angelique Abyss (along with the second age), Shugo Chara, Gakuen Alice Academy, Full Moon wo Sagashite, InuYasha, DearS, and Fushi Yuugi.      I'm looking for an anime series with a girl main character, and for it to be a medium length, or long length. I also like the kind with good art, and cute attitudes for the girl main character. ^^ Other themes besides romance could be drama, comedy, or science fiction. I'd love for it to make me cry, laugh, and make my heart race. ^^      I don't like really short animes, they are usually so good, but they end too fast. I also don't like the Mecha or Galactic (space or starship) type.      I've tried Kirarin Revoulition, but I can't find the episodes. If you suggest that one for me, it would be helpful for you to give me a site that has the episodes (working) on it. ^^      Please give me some answers! I never get anough anime these days, lolz. ^.^

20090131133254AA50hNp	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Since when is R&P a hangout for playground bullies?	Normally, we here in R&P are relatively supportive and for the most part, respectful and smart. However, I've been noticing that there's a lot of hate going around here, like a virus. Just because someone has a different opinion than yours, doesn't mean you have to call them an idiot. Just because someone likes music that "sucks", doesn't mean you have to tell them that they are an inferior human being. I can't stand MCR (I believe most of you agree) but, if I see a question titled "MCR fans ONLY" or "What are MCR's Tour Dates?" I'll ignore it. Many people, however, will be blatantly and unnecessarily disrespectful and (for lack of a better word) mean to the questioner. Is it the 2 points? Are you willing to answer a questionm that you don't agree with, in a completely harsh way for 2 points, when you don't have to answer it at all? I think people may be braver, when talking to people here, than in "real life" because if you say something nasty, the other person can't really defend themselves and they can't very well smack you through your computer screen. Let's start spreading the love. Whaddaya say?

It seems what's left of my human side   Is slowly changing ... in me   (Will you give in to me?)      3: Run and tell all of the angels   This could take all night   Think I need a devil to help me   Get things right      Hook me up a new revolution   Cos this one is a lie   We sat around laughing   And watch the last one die      4: (You wanted to)   Grab a brush and put on a little makeup   (You wanted to)   Hide the scars to fade away the shake up   (You wanted to)   Why'd you leave the keys up on the table?

Years of pain still haunt us all, we saw the last sunrise,   Take me home, in freedom, for a lifetime...

I imagine it going down like this: we pick either a song that everyone has to cover or an album that everyone must pick a song off of to cover. we give participants a couple weeks or a month to prepare and then we all post are results. we would leave the results question open for a week and then let everyone vote.      MQ: anyone interested?   MQ2: any suggestions for how the challenge might go (if you dont like something about my preliminary idea)?   MQ3: any suggestions for what we should pick to cover?   I am thinking for the song... something that everyone more or less knows, something that takes well to being covered and something that is open to very diverse arrangements so people can do it in the style or genre that they are interested in.      Ok here is what I am thinking:      I think I should post this a few more time over the next week or so to make sure that everyone who might participate knows about it. I am thinking next Thursday in the Rock and Pop section (I’m putting these in several genres to get the biggest and most diverse turnout possible, but will have the actual question in Rock and Pop) I'll have a vote on what song to do.

They play it on Hip Hop Nation on Sirius Satellite Radio every night around the same time. It's driving me crazy trying to get the name or artist so I can download it.

The rapper were basically telling J Dilla what's going on in the world today since he left us. Any help is greatly appreciated thanks!
