rnVdxXotaa	Unfortunately at your age insurance prices are going to be very expensive, what you can do is the pass plass course and that usually reduces your insurance by up to 30%.<br>  <br>  Also when you look for insurance try calling the companies up directly since they usually give a lower price then compared to comparison sites online.|`|cxJSW5p4aa	dont buy a car with a loan that will make it more expensive<br>  buy a car with cash that way you dont have worry with a car note, and your will just have to get liability coverage|`|VZlcSpz6aa	if your looking to buy a new car some dealers do free insurance...if not look for a group 1,2,3,4 car with small ngine    if youre over 25 get an old classic car over 25 years for cheap insurance....porche 944 around ￡100|`|iMttE2mraa	Admiral insurance<br>  And try looking for a Ford Fiesta.|`|nAX8Hfcuaa	elephant is cheap|`|c4Eg4tniaa	As stated, go for a low insurance bracket car,<br>  <br>  and I swear by searching up 4 young drivers!!|`|530fc5625af617fef3f442bfdc20f598aa	Not sure about the cost of cars but I do know that cheap insurance for young drivers (under 25)  doesn't exist.

jMkCFLxUaa	The valve is separate from the tire and mounts through the wheel.  If you just had the tire replaced (they usually replace the valve stem when they replace the tire) they should fix it for free, because it was their screw up.|`|9oH03qkJaa	I think you are thinking of a tire inner tube. Tires on passenger vehicles have been tubeless since the 1950's.

7tV3o2q4aa	Neither.  Get the Jetta Wagon, and use the money you didn't spend on the GTI packages on mods to make the car do what you want it to do.  I upgraded the suspension and chipped mine, because I wanted a little quicker than stock and tighter handling, but with the stock (BORING!!!) appearance I never get hassled by the local cops.|`|GIFCh6Ccaa	very similar, but no.  there's not enough room in a vw for 5 people.  they are a bit light on leg room making them one of the poorer small cars for carrying people in the back.|`|M7u1QHBXaa	I think another thing that people haven't touched on yet is accessibility. <br>  <br>  If you get a GTI then you have to fold down the front seats and the person has to crawl into the back. The a GLI is 4 doors, which makes it a lot easier to carry more people. <br>  <br>  The size of the trunk is about the same size. The GTI will allow you to stack the bags all the way to the roof if you wanted. The Jetta is restricted since its all enclosed. <br>  <br>  If it was up to me in your situation then I would get the Sedan because of the accessbility. Hope that helps.|`|bSTK2Wd2aa	Both are pretty much the same mechanically but the jetta is a bit heavier. the Jetta would be enough for your storage needs but in my opinion the 2 door GTI is the best looking out of all the configurations.Within the volkwagen community Jettas are ofter referred to as girls cars. It comes down to a matter of preference really, both are great cars and both should suite your described needs, just pick which one you like better|`|N4BFdAdJaa	Like Chris said... the two are pretty much identical mechanically, but the GLI is heavier. The GTI has better acceleration, and I think it is better looking than the GLI. The GLI may have a little more room, but even with the 2 door GTI, it has about the same amount of space as the GLI. The trunk in the GTI is a little bit bigger.<br>  I would get the GTI personally.|`|NrwSw0fsaa	UMM.. I can't believe you are even debating about this... I know alot about volkswagens and I would def. recommend the GLI.<br>  Some things you may wanna know before you get it, and if you go test drive one look for these options...<br>  GLI... comes with turbo... you can get a manual or automatic, if you get a manual, I would get a 6 speed, more horsepower. They are quick cars to begin with, at least the gli and wolfgang edition are.<br>  Also... this is awesome....<br>  when the car is off, say you are standing outside of the car and it's off, keys in your hand, you can roll down the windows without having to get in or turn the car on. If you stick your key in the door turn it to the right and hold it for maybe 5 seconds, the windows will roll down, and if you want them up, turn them to left, hold for a sec and they will go up...moonroof too.<br>  When you are driving at night, ( this only works on manuals I believe)<br>  if you turn your lights off, and BARELY pull up on the E brake your lights will flash, pretty cool...I've actually pulled someone over , them thinking I was a cop....lol..be careful not to pull up all the way, you don't want to actually use the e brake...lol<br>  My opinion.. get the GLI...it will be worth it in the long run.|`|2PIMbbveaa	In my personal opinion the GLI. I just looked at one the other day and compared to the GTI it had alot more room. Enough to fit 5 people and lots of trunk space. The GLI is alot more fun to drive (i test drove the 6-speed). GLI all the way.  Just one other thing you need to be aware of if your not already. Volkswagens are known to have alot of mechanical problems and the parts are expensive. If it were up to me I wouldn't even purchase a Volkswagen. I've owned one for almost a year and the check engine light has een on since i purchased it. Becareful.
jMkCFLxUaa	Not an easy fix and it will be expensive.  I would not try to finish the trip without getting it fixed, because it is only going to keep getting worse.  Plus you could do some serious damage to the engine if coolant is leaking into the engine internals.  Coolant is not a very effective lubricant for engine internals.|`|cc2b0d76cac98fbf61e197db52fde3caaa	If it's a bad head gasket it needs fixed now before you hydrolock the engine and have to replace it, sorry, it's going to cost you.|`|U7oJrc3faa	If the head gasket is blown, you should get a new one ASAP.

BTCtT6edaa	Go to one of the price comparison sites such as confused.com or comparethemarket.com and enter your details, that's the only way you will find out. If you're not willing to give your details there is no way to find out the cost.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Your education, the location you life, the location the car will actually be housed at night when your home, the milage to work or school, and overall guess how much youll drive each year, (thats a hard one noone can really guess that) your age, and any previous tickets and or accidents, the year and model type of the car will all be taken into factor. Grades in class will not matter, only that you took and passed classes. You must answer all the questions, they have the capability to see all this information anyhow, so any ommissions, show you as a liar, and hence thats irresponsible and if they will insure you, they will go higher in price to compensate for dealing with a less than honest person ok. So tell the truth always. Start by getting the quotes for the most lowest coverages allowed by law. Then also get a second quote with more insurance regarding the other car you might hit. If you hit a car valued higher than the limits your paying for, you will be sued for the balance. So if its legal to say take 25000, and the car is worth 50000, you will be sued for 25000 that the insurance isnt covering. Most people get into an accident within their first year, if not then their second year, its not always their fault, but most time if its not, they with more experience would of seen the accident coming and taken measure to avoid it, so be warned, they charge more money until someone is 25 because of this. Maintaining a perfect driving record is key. For me a speeding ticket out of state that I could not get drivers school to erase from my record, my rates went up 15.00 a month for like the next 3 or 4 years, so thats alot of money for me not watching my speed!!|`|GeyFdO5jaa	Just call around to different insurance companies and ask  .|`|jMkCFLxUaa	First, you have to be willing to answer their questions if you want to get insured.  Period.  Driver's Ed classes will reduce your cost,  but the score you passed with won't.  The make of the car will definitely make a difference in the premium you will pay. For example, a small fast sports car will usually cost you more than say a pickup truck because the truck would be safer.  You will usually pay more for a V-8 than you will for a 4 cylinder engine.  The costs between 17 and 18 will not be any different, usually. Depends on your driving record.  You don't get a signinficant drop in insurance premiums until you reach 25.|`|t32fkM31aa	It is a Common situation many people have met,calm down,and check the resource i found pretty useful <a href="http://www.AutoInsuranceFree.info/free-auto-insurance.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.AutoInsuranceFree.info/free-a...</a>|`|Wj0YcSOaaa	Help yourself - you can check your quotes in internet, for example here - autoinsurance.bebto.com

Z9llKxssaa	These older 4 stroke Honda motors aren't that difficult to disassemble/reassemble.  Be sure you have plenty of zip lock bags, and label them as you go.. IE, one bag for all the head bolts, one bag for valve train, etc.  Go slow, use your manual for everything, and be sure you get a top end kit before you start.  This constant ticking could be piston slap against the cylinder wall, and I'm going to assume that it has never been replaced.  Bring your cylinder into a shop and have it honed out if you do replace the old one.  Check your valves closely, because they could be worn out as well. Stainless steel is a good option for a long service life.|`|AA10346371	It sounds to me like you are mechanically inclined. You have a service manual.

SLcZatQBaa	You can use the 95 engine with no problem.  Don't use the original carburator.  The engine will be "breathing through a straw" if you do.  The firing order is different the newer engine so be sure your plug wires are per the firing order of a 1995 5.0 Mustang.  The 1995 roller cammed engines also use a steel camshaft gear on the distributor so you will want to swap a steel gear onto your older distributor or get a remanufactured 1985 distributor from a parts store (make sure you say it's for a 5-speed).  I personally would use the 1985 distributor.<br>  <br>  For a good carb I'd run a 650cfm Holley 4150 on an Edelbrock dual-plane intake if the 1995 longblock is stock and staying that way.

The age range is 18 to 40 people that want to make a eco statement "look I spend money to save the environment. The price will also reduce the market with it being around $40000. I work in a small town dealer and don't really have the right market for the volt most people drive over 100 miles a day to work if they work out of town. The volt will be a 50 50 mix on gender.at least what GM is telling us.

repO76qoaa	The snap back zone is an area where a person could be injured if a mooring line of a ship or large boat, while in use, parted and came flying back. On some ships, the area is painted but not all.<br>  <br>  I remember watching a video in boot camp about the dangers of parting lines, etc and the lines were cutting dummies in half.

A large anchor is lowered from the bow of the ship and just touches bottom(not set).  the bow is held stationary by the anchor and the ship pivots via the stern.<br>  <br>  modern ships use tug boats, bow thrusters and twin screws to maneuver in tight quarter so this technique is not used as much today.<br>  <br>  Small single engine boats can use this maneuver, but it requires weight, this can work with lighter weight anchors if extra chain is used for weight.

If your jeep has been hard to start over the past two months, it could be a bad starter. The brushes will wear out over time and if its the original, it could be the problem. The other possibility is the solenoid, its attached right to the starter. If you pull the assembly off (it should be two bolts and two wires) an auto parts store can test it and tell you if its bad or not. Jeep starters are cheap and there are plenty in the scrap yards. Its possible the connections on the solenoid are loose but not likely unless someone has been working on it recently. The other option is a bad battery, you said you tested it but did you test it for amperage? A dead cell will give you enough power to run accessories but not turn the starter over. I would recommend trying a jump start before taking the starter out.

dEW4jkOuaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  sorry, no, you won't be able to change the taillights simply or fairly inexpensively. I've run into this type of question before, just with the standard halogen headlamps being switched to HID units.<br>  <br>  The wiring and control modules for the LED's are simply not present in the '02. While they are both power loops providing energy from the 12 volt battery to the bulbs, the LED's require different voltage and an entirely different type of harness, not to mention an entirely new taillight lens assembly.<br>  <br>  Call your local Toyota dealership and ask to speak to the parts department. Ask them what the '06 lens' alone would run, then see about the wiring harness'. It will be costly because you are changing a major portion of the vehicle wiring. It is possible there may be aftermarket units, but I would be very cautious about changing the braking wires so fundamentally.<br>  <br>  BTW, the taillights, just like the headlights, in the Highlander Hybrid, are run from the 12 volt system, not the NiMH hybrid battery. Those are two totally separate power systems.|`|jyXUm4YQaa	not trying to be a smartass but yo should be able to look at them and see good luck

ytgjFFq6aa	break bike down to frame, sand with 320 grit sandpaper. if you sand down to plastic then you will need to use an filler  primer, just on the spots that are showing pure plastic. there is no need in priming everything, because from factory it has a sealer. after you prime the spots if any sand them with 320 as well and feather edge so it is all even. i suggest getting a gravity feed spray gun, use 35 psi and spray your base coat. over lap each section you just painted for instance if the spray pattern is 6 inches then over lap the next spray 3 inches down making the top of the pattern meet the middle of the last pattern. allow a flash time between each coat. (flash is when the paint looks hazy cause it is almost dry) after the base coat has been applied, time for your clear coat. read mixing instructions for clearcoat cause they are all different. usually takes a 4 to 1 mixture which means 4 parts clear to 1 part clear activator. spray the same way as you did your base. allow a 15 mins between each coat, thats about how long it takes to flash, and repeat about 4 times if you want a really shinny paint job. after the clear is completely dry take some wet or dry 1200 grit sandpaper and water sand everything. after you watersand out the trash and runs if any buff it. painting is not difficult but it requires alot of patience.<br>  Good Luck!!!!!!!!!|`|xaf3poA3aa	Yeah...... They way your suggestion would work..... If you were VERY carefull, taped wverything off well, removed the tape promptly, sprayed everything nice and even. Unfortunatly it just wouldent have that shine, parts would chip off, and it will never look very professional. I share your frustration... you want to upgrade your bike but don't have alot of cvash to do it and u think putting in hard work instead will make up for it... it wont.<br>  <br>  A much better idea would be to spend the extensive time it would take to do this project working at your normal job (or gettin one if u don't have one) Then you can earn the money and pay a professional to have it done or even just buy a new bike!|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	If you wanted it to look like crap then yes that's all you need to do.  You'll need a professional spray gun for sure. First off you need to break the bike down to bare frame, sand it, prime it and then paint. After that you want to apply your clear coats.  My advice is to take your frame to a body shop and let them do it for you.

XLXncQu9aa	Simply because they do not understand the "right of way".  Basically the right of way means you yield to all on coming traffic no matter which way you are turning.  That is the problem with drivers today.  They assume too much and they end up in accidents.  If you are at a stop sign no matter what way the car in front of you is turning, you are always required to stop.  It could also be impatience.  Drivers don't feel like obeying the rules because they are in a hurry to go nowhere and they run stop signs when they should wait.  I believe that when they take risks like what you are referring to and they ignore laws, eventually they will pay the price.  Its wrong, and its pure foolishness.  Someone could be killed due to another person's poor decisions.|`|31Ttgqlbaa	They are just impatient and didn't yield the right of way.

This will be cheaper in the long run.<br>  <br>  Also, if you live in the United States, the bike is newer than 1985, and is a 2 stroke, you won't be able to use it on the street.  In 1985 the EPA banned 2 stroke bikes over 49CC for use on the street.<br>  <br>  To get the best information on this, you would be better off contacting your local DMV.  These are the people you will need to satisfy to get your bike on the street.

I drive a 2004 Silverado and i'm a first year college student and I'm spoiled. It seems like you want a car for a status symbol.

Do you NEED navigation, the luxury package, 4WD, Limited Edition, Moon and Tune pkg??  Ok, Tune pkg YES !  Roof rack?? Sure, if you snowboard, ski, camp, remote start - prolly not unless you're in a northern state, and leather, prolly not because if you tear it, it's MUCH more expensive to fix. <br>  <br>  Personally, for a high school student who statistics prove is much more likely to get in an accident than a college student (NOT saying it would be your fault), I'd go with something more simple, unless you're looking for status??  <br>  <br>  If $ isn't an issue for you because your parents are footing the bill, get something smaller / more practical, ask them for the difference in cash, or just save the $$ for yourself!  <br>  <br>  My opinion, but your decision!|`|dCuWCbRkaa	I like the Escape and probably wouldn't want anything but an SUV.

I think that a quality used car that's around 5 years old is good for a high school student. Have you even thought about car insurance? Even if your parents are loaded, that doesn't mean that you can expect them to pay your way until you're done with college. If you're under 21, your insurance will be so high. It will be even higher with a BRAND NEW CAR. Insurance is high on brand new cars for married adults with perfect records. Something more modest is suitable for a high school student, in my opinion. I think that at your age, it's really important to learn about the responsibilities of paying bills. Is the Ford Escape something that you can afford half of the monthly payments of on your own? Is it gas efficient?<br>  <br>  I don't mean to act like a wet blanket for you, but driving is a huge responsibility, and so is owning and caring for a car, and you must think like an adult about this!! <br>  <br>  Whatever you choose though, good luck :)|`|pdg3zsApaa	lol i'm interested in the same exact car..just an older model.

119ca40f98202d58cfc2090a452b22ceaa	I'd have to say the Duramax.  The duramax is built by Isuzu.  The Vortec is built by GM and is a POS engine.  <br>  <br>  I'm not a fan of GM period, and even less of a fan now that they're getting my money from being bailed out.  <br>  <br>  My suggestion is buy a Toyota Tundra they're built in the US.|`|39WRk789aa	Been a GM guy all my life, though i've had the one dodge, and the one ford, and rest have been GM, wasn't much a fan of the 6.0l vortec it had power and worked well, but bought an Duramax and chiped and straight piped, and this sucker pulls my loaders great!!!!!! great power and even turning the chip up for a little racing here and there, you won't be disappointed!|`|gsjjiRGFaa	do you plan to use this truck in stock form. if so, for what purpose? the dmax will be your workhorse, hands down. it produces torque down low that the vortec couldn't hope to. diesel engines are often referred to as torque monsters. this gets that 6000lb brick up from rest quite nicely. if you need more speed, you can mod this engine to stupid levels.<br>  for a quick way off the line, and for less cash, you might opt for the vortec. this will feel plenty fast. you can mod this one as well, plus the fuel is a bit cheaper.<br>  in my humble opinion, you can't go wrong with either, though my preference is the dmax. a diesel has more usable power for driving in town, on the highway, and towing. how would you use the truck? weigh it out

oxMIBBTLaa	you could put a better set of heads and a cam in it. a smaller  chamber head will increase you combustion ratio and a higher lift cam with a longer duration will allow you to get more atomized fuel in to the combustion chamber and that will give you more power, <br>  try a set of heads off of a 305 they tend to have a smaller chamber and what size cam you would need would depend on how much more you want. but make sure that you do a cam with matched lifters and new push rods. and also make sure that your heads have new valve springs.<br>  if i were you i would go to the website of like crane cams they have a good reference for what cam would be good for your application.<br>  you can also change the gears in your rear end that will help the vehicle get to top speed faster. <br>  hope this helps
e01bQd95aa	If it's coming from the transmission, your best bet would be to drop the tranny pan and see what is at the bottom of the pan. If there are minute pieces of metal (like dust), It probably isn't that. If the oil is burned and there are chunks, you will have to replace it. A new one is too expensive, so get a rebuilt one or a second hand from the junkyard (same tranny, motor low milage).|`|AA11032586	Put your car up on jack stands and drop transmission pan. Look for big chunks of metal. It sounds like your torque converter has broken vanes in it. I would recommend calling a couple of reputable transmission shops and get estimates on getting yours rebuilt. That will be a lot cheaper getting yours rebuilt than a new one or worrying about fit. Also will have a warranty.|`|pKE76Wifaa	Good advice-get a really good paying job your gona need it

It could be either fuel pump or fuel filter... not sure if that the problem with your car, but i think thats it. be careful, if its the fuel pump, eventually it will fail, and you will be stuck wherever it failed. Good luck|`|a01OSTTRaa	While water damage, commonly known as vapor lock, could have occurred; it usually destroys the motor. <br>  <br>  Odds are you have one of a few ill-timed things occurring.<br>  <br>  1. VTEC is not engaging. Your car will go into limp mode when this occurs. It is frequently caused by low oil or a fouled crankshaft position sensor. Check both and clean the sensor, allowing it to dry completely before putting it back in.<br>  <br>  2. Fouled ignition, DEI, or plugs caused by water.<br>  <br>  Did you get a check engine light when this happened? If so, get a CEL reader from an auto parts store and look for pending codes.

ndVtjPKYaa	What you are experiencing is what is known as "turbo lag"  when you switch gears and let off the gas, the turbo isn't spinning like it was when you were on the fuel and it takes it a minute to spool up again.  Tuning it may help it out, but I could not say for sure.  This is a common problem on just about any stock turbocharger.

Click the link below for an online VIN decoder...<br>  <br>  You may have to cross-reference the sprocket by part number and manufacturer if that information is stamped on the sprocket.  You might want to see if a similar item is manufactured by Lifan, based on sprocket diameter, number of teeth and pitch.  Many of the Chinese bikes are based on older Lifan designs which are copies of older Honda designs.
AA10346371	When I was young I had a friend that had one of these.  I remember it going faster than 25 MPH.  More like 50 MPH on a level road.<br>  <br>  This all depends on the year.  Most were sold between 1971 and 1978.  If you have one that is this old it is very possible it is due an overhaul.  The rings could be worn.  There are seals inside the crank case that can leak which will cause a loss of power.  There could be a problem with the rotary valve.  It could also be a plugged mufler.  Oil and gunk can accumulate in the muffler.  Remove the exhaust pipe and clean it out with solvent.<br>  <br>  Even if you have a newer model you may still have some of these same problems.

I have had contracts like this and when the car was delivered wrong, I was no longer had to take the car...I took it because I'd have to wait another 8 weeks for another car... but it was my choice.<br>  (This thumbs downer is a real jerk.. how do you thumb down an answer when you are brainless and he must think he signed my contract for me... and don't even give an answer)|`|PA7kYyAxaa	Seems you may of been bilked. Usually, it's best to buy a car "in person".|`|LQc1WZPsaa	Let me start out by saying I'm not when it comes to auto repair. Last week I had some problems with my Pontiac Grand Prix and I wasn't sure how to fix them. I tried to search the Internet for help, but the procedures were too complex for my skills. I ended up going to the dealship for my repairs. The dealership tends to charge more than mom and pop repair shops, but they've seen all sorts of situations ( insurance problems, repair warranty issues, etc) and they seem to always find a way to help me. Maybe you can try calling auto repair shops in Nevada to see if they can help you. <a href="http://www.autorepairshoplocator.com/Nevada-Auto-Repair.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.autorepairshoplocator.com/Nev...</a>|`|AA12018403	did you sign the actual contract? or just the buyers order?  a buyers order allows the dealer to take a deposit and get the car from another dealer.  A valid contract must have the exact vehicle purchased on it including vin.

XKYJk6Tcaa	your Silvana's cool blue only have the slightest blue tint to them and you barley notice it unless you are in an on coming car. but to look at them they do not appear blue. it you are looking for the intense blue white light you have to upgrade to zenon lights which are a ton of money and allot more trouble than they are worth.
5427036efac063a7732d113e0750bf0faa	How fast does it cycle? It's normal for it to cycle every few minutes or so. But, if it's cycling every few seconds, then it's possibly low on refrigerant, or it could have a bad pressure switch. In that case, take it to your local qualified, trusted mechanic and have them check it out.|`|839c3d2ee5b00b14fa62aee50f8c5d01aa	I assume that you're talking about the compressor - it cycles on and off as long as the A/C is running - nothing to do with the engine idling.  You should worry if it stays on all the time.|`|qsozRiDGaa	The A/C compressor will cycle on and off either when the air conditioning or the front dash defroster is on regardless if you are at idle or driving.

WWqmHTYSaa	EHHHH wrong, not balance of the tires, however it will help when your at speeds from 65 - 85 that's the only time in which balanced tires really matter. However your alignment is a cause for concern. Your car is probably tilted to the left or right a fraction of an inch even though you can't see it, it can make a humongous difference. It's quite cool actually, saw a car riding almost like it was on an angle once. anyway yeah get your alignment checked first. Sometimes if you aske nicely then they'll balance your tires too.|`|3mo8vrpTaa	No offense, but don't listen to your father.  NO cam BALANCE issue ever caused an engine to shake.  Damaged lobe or very aggressive profile sure.(not to include one Mitzi engine that used counter rotating balance shafts driven off oil pump chain) <br>  Look to see evidence of a missing wheel weight. Also did you hit a bad pot hole.  Maybe check ball joints and tie rod ends.  But my first suspect it tire balance!!!|`|3a7df0a42cac7e2891f8bca9cf50d631aa	This usually happens with the tyres, check the wheel alignment and tyre balancing. Mostly, the tyres need balancing.|`|839c3d2ee5b00b14fa62aee50f8c5d01aa	You probably need to have your tires balanced and rotated.|`|aSZ05n6Laa	I would check to see if you need to get your front-end aligned.  This would cause the shaking.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	get the tires checked. they might need balanced or maybe a belt is broke in 1 of the tires. it also might be out of alignment.|`|AA10331789	Have your tires rotated and see if anything changes to detect a tire problem. If you think the engine could be miss firing, maybe you could check some tune-up items like the ignition and emissions etc.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aa1car.com/library/tuneup1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aa1car.com/library/tuneup1.ht...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mobil1.com/USA-English/MotorOil/Car_Care/DIY/Maintenance_Check.aspx?pg=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.mobil1.com/USA-English/MotorO...</a>

NzIoJlNUaa	What model subs do you have.<br>  If they are 4ohm SVC then you can't bridge them to the amp at 4ohms,and that amp won't handle a 2ohm load when bridged.|`|1c0c973b392b482e30be82d985344c50aa	I'm not even going to attempt to see if your amp can handle the load, you can read the manual yourself. <br>  <br>  but anyway, if they are single voice coil subs (1 set of terminals) you could wire them up in parallel to get a 2 ohm load.<br>  <br>  So it would be:<br>  (amp) +ch1 to +sub1<br>  (amp) -ch2 to -sub1<br>  +sub 1 to +sub2<br>  -sub1 to -sub2<br>  <br>  OR <br>  <br>  run 2 sets of wires from the same bridged channels from the amp to each separate sub.|`|9ee6572e98b952a4bf68a1e6e6c2b500aa	You can't wire your subs up to 2 ohm when bridged.  Your amp is not stable at that load so you shouldn't try to wire it up that way.  You can either wire one sub up to each channel or you can wire the subs in parallel on one channel.  That would be pointless because it would be less power then it would if you ran one sub off of each channel.<br>  <br>  That is assumming your subs are 4 ohm SVC.  If they are DVC then you can wire each sub up to 2 ohms on each channel.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|uL5772kCaa	You can't bridge that amp at 2 ohms... it will create a 1 ohm load and you will fry your amp.
AA11264416	yes, they're the exact same underneath the body, only thing different is the emblems and front grilles and headlights, you can actually take the front fenders, grille, headlights and bumper off one of them and bolt them right on the other, hell you can even put those parts off a cadillac escalade and put it on a GMC or chevy truck/suv, just like ford and mercury, or dodge and plymouth|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it will work ! GMC and chevy are the same thing|`|JkTGq2BJaa	actually devgru seem like the stupid one because gmc and chevy are both GM as well as pontiac, buick, hummer, saturn, Saab, Cadillac but to answer your question they both take the same engine and transmissions. They used to have their own motor spec's but in the early 80's they all just became GM engines and transmissions.|`|WWqmHTYSaa	yeah for the most part, however don't forget to check the model, some are like the 5.4 where the next version is the 6.0. Something stupid like that can really mess up a quick fix. Just something to remember.|`|5xxuKzXPaa	i have always seen gmc as a generic made chevy. the two are from the same manufacturer. and yes parts will bolt up from one to another.|`|S9QyF6NQaa	they are the same and will work with one another|`|kmGW34unaa	GMC IS CHEVY........

nAzbLdBCaa	Mercruiser didn't use a lot if Holly carbs, and I've seldom seen any "broken" in the sense that they can be rebuilt, often by local shops that can do auto carbs. Marine carbs have linkages and other parts that are not the same as Automotive, but other parts like air Horn and throttle plates are very standard.  I'd check with a carb shop, and they should be able to rebuild your carbs......i don't have my old reference books, but i think the 4011 is to small.  I agree with Jims we need to know about your engines..........EDIT..........<br>  I'm still not understanding what is actually breaking.   You can go to almost any auto parts house and get a matching Holly carb that has been rebuilt for auto use with the exception that they don't have the marine linkage and or baseplate,........those you have.   Using your old one for parts, put the base linkage on the "new" rebuilt auto parts cab.  Simply rebuilding your old carb isn't working.   I  may be wrong but the 4011 bolt holes should match, but the carb will "act" different on the engine.  I think that's what Jim is talking about.  On twins the acceleration curve should match.   The 4011 was designed for auto use with a smoother lower end torque.  I'm pretty sure both are 650 CFM.  Check and replace the HS orifices if necessary.  Last time I did something like this you could buy new for about $1000...|`|54ceb4afd91eb6d0c822b057cd3d44efaa	The bolt pattern will probably match, but you may have a hard time getting power balance, especially during acceleration.

You'll pay at least ￡1000, my cousin passed his test last year at 19 and to insure a Peugeot 106 2001 he paid ￡1370 full comp. If you can try adding an older more experienced driver onto the policy as well, that may bring the premium down. Also a Golf or Corsa will be classed as being a hot hatch and you may find that something less trendy might bring a cheaper quote. Good luck.|`|Ot1R3t5uaa	the insurance companies probably will not insure you at 17 on that sort of car, but if they do, you could probably expect to pay in the region of ￡15- ￡1800 a year.|`|ffc2e6d63c3d0e7bd58b65ae3981c966aa	put your details into a comparison website like GoCompare.com and find out, you don't have to buy it.

If you are the main driver on your car, it will be about ￡1500 for a female and ￡2000 for a male (this is rough) and this is for fully comprehensive insurance, if you get third party only or TPFT it will be cheaper.  If you are just a named driver on your parents car it will be a couple of hundred for a year.|`|c4Eg4tniaa	Well, a newer car isn't always the better option, as the value's higher.<br>  No one can really give you a rough price, as it all varies on where the car's parked, (garage would be the best)<br>  <br>  What insurance approved gadgets there are, (immobiliser, alarm) etc.<br>  <br>  Your mileage,<br>  <br>  Your postcode.<br>  <br>  I was looking at paying in excess of 2000 as my lowest quote, for an '05 1.5 Almera, <br>  <br>  The lowest quote I recieved is now 910!<br>  <br>  Search up 4youngdrivers<br>  <br>  And avoid comparison sites!!!!|`|bdc81a350221a05348d3b5708b5daa86aa	Try www.gocompare.com but as you will be a learner driver under 25 it will be around ￡1500 if your paying it monthly it will be about ￡130 as you pay a little interest as its monthly and a deposit when you take out the insurance - I looked around for myself and fully comp with full no claims bonus is ￡13 per month with AA Insurance|`|41fe712a36ecf2746af8f97a562a2794aa	Use confused.com<br>  <br>  Just put in any fake name/address details, but keep your age, car, value etc true. It'll give you a quick idea of how much you'll be paying.<br>  <br>  Insurance is for 12 months, the cheapest covers you for fire damage and theft of/from the car (TPFT).

That's a $16,000 difference up front that you are investing<br>  2) if financed, the difference between the two is $574 per month on 60 months @ 6.65% for the 2008 versus $269 per month for the same term and at the same rate for the 2004<br>  3) depreciation will be at about $0.20 per mile regardless of the year so if you are driving the vehicle for 40,000 miles your depreciation will be $800 to $1200 for the 60,000 miles<br>  <br>  the interest of putting the money in the bank won't overcome the interest you pay on either the loan or in lost interest in the difference in purchase price if you pay cash.<br>  <br>  you can look at any of the used car sites such as kelly blue book <a href="http://kbb.com" rel="nofollow">http://kbb.com</a> and do comparisons for each of the years to see how much in value the Odyssey loses on average year over year to project what the decrease in the recover value is when you go to sell it a few years from now.<br>  <br>  based on the comparison of the 2004 to the 2008 it comes out to about $4000 per year lost but keep in mind the vehicle changed substantially in 2006 and that there have been increases in base prices between those years so you would have to go by the % of the original price over time.<br>  <br>  for me, it looks like the 2004 would be a much better deal<br>  <br>  hope that helps

wpgRMjgraa	Because a synthetic oil is chemically produced, there are no contaminants in the oil. <br>  <br>  By contrast, conventional oils contain small amounts of sulfur, wax, and asphaltic material that can promote detonation as well as varnish and sludge buildup. <br>  <br>  With no wax, synthetics will flow at much lower temperatures than conventional oils.

Most of the time, cars with more horsepower can be faster, but sometimes this is different.<br>  <br>  A Lotus Elise can beat a ford mustang V6 at a race because it has a turbocharged engine.

gjAZeRyfaa	Honda Civic hatchhbacks are the best value out there.

Yes. Would I have one? No. Everyone tells the people who ask these questions to get a Civic because it is less likely to break down when you get some random ricer boy who doesn't know what he's doing and he thrashes the s*** out of it. You want a Mustang? If you have the cash go and buy a Mustang! Just so long as you take care of it technically any car can be as reliable as a Civic, unless it's either Korean or Swedish. I suggest any sort of Nissan. They're sporty, they look cool, they're fun to drive, and they're still reliable.|`|rc8Hg8e0aa	Yes they're dependable.Wouldn't own one though.<br>  There are lots of other great used cars around the same price of a civic that are better than the civic.Civics are just the known "Beginners Car" because of low cost and dependability.Look for another car.|`|Ddfff5psaa	My first car was a Chevy Aveo, it ran beautifully, just stay away from ford, most of their vehicles have been getting recalled lately.
XJGsVEmDaa	I'm taking it that your car has the seats that are warmed and cooled. Lexus does not use a heater element now because it would interfere with the holes in you seat for the cooling part but now uses heater that has air blow past a heating coil and pushes warm air into the seats. Lexus should now say that you have seat warmers not heaters because they do not get as hot as previous models. You can remove and clean the filters on your seats to allow more air to be pushed through the seats (they are located under the seat towards the front) just use compressed air.|`|7edf5543fb479567c4ec66d9c2af3698aa	Thats funny.

But, I do think my choice would be between the Audi and BMW.
HFrsH9MRaa	Many Audi's have rear brakes that require a special tool to "screw in" the brake piston. This is so that the parking brake will set. You will have to ask around as to where you can acquire this tool. Sometimes, you can get away with using a large adjustable channel lock wrench. Screw the piston in until it bottoms out. Then, replace the pads. (Axxis pads are very good). WHen you have done both sides, pump the brakes several times to reset the pistons. Voila!!|`|mKVFIklaaa	As above, but you don't need any special tools: A large screwdriver or long nosed pliers is all that's necessary.<br>  Get yourself a Haynes manual, it'll pay for itself just for this one job.

Probably, or probably not.<br>  <br>  Ask two 'experts' the same question and be guaranteed to receive two differing responses.<br>  <br>  In this case all you can really do is take it and point out the fault and say "do you concur that is needs repairing?"<br>  <br>  Depending on the outcome you can make a decision. What I would say that comes out here which (IMPO) is more important, will the vehicle really be safe to use and if not what of any Innocent person that may be hurt through no fault of your own other than perhaps not getting it fixed?<br>  <br>  Difficult, but I have no doubt which way I would go when safety of my own life and any others that may be affected by my decision.<br>  <br>  Curtis|`|KPFQBQa1aa	Safety inspectors are human and all have different opinions.

There are some other Audi's that have the AWD feature too. Yeah I know you didn't list Audi's but they are pretty closely made to something like a BMW, which you have listed and safer in the snow than a BMW.|`|FFrXGuxMaa	You will have to do some research on each type and test-drive a few. Each car will have it's advantages and disadvantages. As far as snow-driving goes, you have to have good tires, and drive cautiously. Accelerate slowly and give yourself extra room to brake. Turn at about half the speed you usually would and if you feel yourself slip, let the car slip and then gently steer it the way you want to go. Also, be sure to keep emergency supplies in the car. This includes some snacks and water/juice and a warm blanket, jacket/sweater, and gloves and hat in case you get stuck and need to wait for help or walk for help. Always keep a snow-scraper in your car and keep it well-maintained during winter.|`|gnonlDpiaa	Any car is safe in the snow. It's those pesky drivers that make them dangerous

pXIKbbscaa	There is no ONE insurance company that is right for everyone - everyone is rated individually - and all companies have different "likes and dis-likes", different credit tiers, different business models, and many other factors that can vary your rate - and a QUOTE is ONLY a quote until the policy is issued.<br>  <br>  Typically, insurance rates will vary from State to State and can even vary by ZIPCODE! It also will depend on the type of car/truck, coverages, limits of liability, and driving record. Some companies run credit scores and MOST run a motor vehicle report and CLUE (Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange) report to see about undisclosed accident involvement.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is call a LOCAL independent agent or broker. Don't go across town, or to some other city - look for someone CLOSE. Just look in the phone book for the PIA or Big I (Trusted Choice) logos and you will find a professional licensed agent that will be able to help you solve your insurance problems, and give you rate comparisons of several different companies. <br>  <br>  An independent insurance agent will normally have a dozen different companies and if he cannot help you, he should be networked with other local agents that can. <br>  <br>  In my agency, we have companies that do NOT run a credit score and welcome drivers with "less than perfect" driving records and specialize in youthful operators!<br>  <br>  Most of the replies on this site say "go to this on-line carrier or that on-line carrier or that 1-800 number" but I'm sure that when you do, you will find some impersonal computer user with a script to work from and you won't be able to talk with the same person every time you have a problem!<br>  <br>  Good luck, drive RESPONSIBLY and I hope this helps!|`|kjAWsDwLaa	At 19, with that record, you're probably stuck for several years with a non-standard (high-risk) company until your record clears up.

AA12339318	Possible but unlikely.  Depends on the road surface, how the person landed, his physical condition, whether he had any training and so on.<br>  <br>  Lets say the car was on a narrow roadway, without a paved shoulder.  Let us also say that the road was lined with tall, thick grasses and clear of rocks, bottles and other obstructions.  If the person were able to jump far enough to the side to miss the paved portion of the road, land, on his feet, squarely in the thick grass and properly tucked and rolled until the momentum was spent, he MIGHT be able to get up with little more than some superficial scratches.<br>  <br>  But, more likely, he would end up with shattered ankles and, at least, fractures of the legs, arm, hip and, perhaps back and neck.  If he fell face first, even into the grass, he'd probably break his neck and/or back.  If he missed the grass, there's be a very real chance of a LOT of broken bones, including the skull.<br>  <br>  Speed limit?

JcZnB3bRaa	Those lugs are actually called key lugs. You need a special key lug to remove them.  They are used to prevent wheel theft. Most owners have a key lug kept in their glove box or where there jack and handle are stored. If you cannot find one, check with a local tire seller for some assistance. <br>  <br>  On the "smoothed end" of the lug as you called it, you should notice it is grooved.  Your key lug should fit that groove.

DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT run peak power to both subs! You will blow those Type-R's. Now, they are rated for 500 Watts RMS, thats a lot of punch, trust me. If you run 500 Watts to each sub, you will not be disappointed I promise you. And, since you have dual 2-ohm subwoofers, you can wire them in parallel with a mono amplifer, and still present the amplifer with a 2-ohm load. I would highly recommend this amplifer: ALPINE PDX-1.1000 This amplifer, will power those two 12" Type-R's AMAZINGLY! You will be running maximum RMS rating to both subs, it will be loud. The price for this amp is a little steep but you may be able to find it cheaper depending on how much looking you do online. If you look for a diffferent amp, your best bet is to look for an amp that is a mono amplifer and puts out 1000W @ 2-ohms x 1 or a 2-channel amplifer that puts out 500W @ 2-ohms x 2. Here is a link for the amp: <a href="http://www.alpine-usa.com/US-en/products/product.php?model=PDX-1.1000&lang=en&tab=F" rel="nofollow">http://www.alpine-usa.com/US-en/products...</a><br>  Hope I helped you out and good luck.

If speedometer doesn't work it is most likely the cruise control box I have replace a lot of those units.

2cb3153c313f04e3810e6bc6151a9494aa	First off, the C2 vs C4 part:  I've had a fair amount of time behind of wheels of both, and quite a bit of that time having been at the track.  The overall character of these cars is much more similar than different (at least with the current generation... the first AWD 964s are significantly different in feel and driving approach from their early 90s RWD counterparts).<br>  <br>  The bigs difference between the two is in the small details.  Obviously the AWD system has a greater potential for traction.  This comes with a trade off in weight and a little more parastic power loss.  But these losses are less than the traction gains, and in stock form the AWD is a definite advantage.  However, in non-stock form the issue becomes a little bit hazier.<br>  <br>  RWD has the advantage of less weight, but more importantly for performance applications, the ability to have a greater differential of tire width between the front and back wheels (with AWD, you must consider how it will affect the power split from the differential and need to keep these much closer in size).  In all forms, the fronts are going to be limited by what is practical in terms of maintaining a workable slip angle, with the rears then being limited by trying to keep a balance in relation to the front... but in the end, the traction advantage of AWD will be mostly negated in a car prepared for track use due to the greater contact patch in the back (if the car is setup around this... meaning that the AWD is then just heavier and less powerful).<br>  <br>  As for the 911 and Corvette part:  Most people will probably go on about the differences; and there are many from how each car reflects many of the sensibilities of their countries of origin, where the engine is located, etc etc.  But what is most defining about each of these cars is, I think, a commonality.  Both of these are cars that have a certain character that tends to lead people to either love them or hate them.  They are quirky cars that require some experience to drive properly, and in that context they can be very fast (yes, they are fast cars, but when seen in the right hands, they are much faster).<br>  <br>  911s are back heavy and can be punishing to an unsure and inexperienced driver, and for many, dealing with all that weight behind the rear axel means the right this is often counter-intuitive.  But they are very rewarding to drive when you get it all right!  Corvettes feel big and feel unsteady, even as they push into a corner and settle in without a problem.  They have what feels like limitless torque as you push from a corner... and when you get it all right, they are very rewarding to drive!<br>  <br>  Comparing a similar 911 to the Corvette, the Corvette will have more power, and likely more pure grip.  The 911 will enjoy advantages in braking and transient handling.  The Corvette definitely offers more performance bang for the buck, though the Porsche will have better build quality and higher quality components.  The Corvette is not poorly made, but it is not on par with Porsche; the Porsche offers good performance for it's cost, but it's not on par with the value offered by the 'Vette.|`|39a31a051385c5a79b6d9d15bc93d8c7aa	first off, this heavily depends on what year z06 you have, and what generation 911 youre looking at. <br>  <br>  as for 2wd vs 4wd, 4wd 911s get very boring to drive in comparison the RWD varieties. They understeer, are heavy, and dont have that classic 911 feel to them. Good buddy of mine recently went from a really silly fast  996 turbo to a c6 z06 and has much more fun in the vette. The RWD 911s can be pretty scary and difficult to handle at the limit though, but I consider that a good thing. So much fun and the car is always a learning experience. Unless youre going to be driving the car in the snow, the 2WD 911 really is the only way to go. <br>  <br>  And as for comparisons, it really depends on what model vette and what year 911 youre talking about. The 996 and 997 911s drive nicer and handle better than the C5 vettes by miles, but acceleration is pretty on par. The C6 Z06 is significantly faster than either, but isnt anywhere as precise to drive as the 911s, but is miles ahead of the C5 z06 in all categories. The cabin room in a 911 really isnt significantly larger than in a vette, as the back seats are for small children and amputees and no much else. The vettes are also cheaper to modify and have more potential for a given amount of cash. <br>  <br>  basically, it depends on what you have, what you want, and what youre going to use it for. Any added info would be handy.|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	As proven on the famous car tv show TOP GEAR on BBC America, the AWD Porsche is quicker around the race track.<br>  <br>  With AWD, you could go into turns at a higher speed than you would with RWD.|`|gOQ5mZ7Xaa	Well actually the Corvette ZR1 is faster than the seemingly all-powerful Porsche Carrera GT, why not go for that? The ZR1's currently the second fastest production car around the Nurburgring Nordschliefe (behind the Dodge Viper ACR, 4 seconds between them) and it would be quicker than most Porsches except for maybe the GT2 which costs some 4 times as much as a ZR1.<br>  <br>  Personally while Porsches are great to drive and they're a 2+2 arrangement in most of 'em for practicality, I'm not convinced in the way they look. Personal opinion I know but I reckon you'll turn more heads in the ZR1.<br>  <br>  Now for the question at hand. Whether you pick the Carrera or the Carrera 4/911 Turbo (which is also AWD) mainly depends on where you live, and whether it is snowy or sunny. AWD makes most dividends in winter conditions where it's a lot easier to spin out with a RWD car, which would make things even worse considering the 911s have the engine right over the rear axle, which would make it prone to fishtailing quite a bit more. In sunny/dry conditions and for normal everyday driving though the only real difference between AWD and RWD is that you'll have more traction off the line with AWD and AWD, while it tends to understeer, will yield better handling. The big all-rounder of the 911 field is the Turbo, I'd go with that.<br>  <br>  This article by Motor Trend pits the ZR1 against the Porsche GT2 (the top of the range), the Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano, and the Nissan R35 GT-R. And performance-wise, it blitzes everything except for the Ferrari on the high-speed test by 1mph, but on the drag and circuit the ZR1 reigns supreme. The only criticisms are the looks and the cheapy interior, but the "3ZR" package makes up in the interior side of things.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/coupes/112_0810_2009_corvette_zr1_vs_porsche_gt2_vs_ferrari_599_vs_nissan_gtr/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/coup...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helped.
WMPqVYe1aa	Hi, try buying a car with low mileage and low age as well.  Check out some of the internet sites on car valuations(NRMA in Australia), they can give you some guide as to what mileage is average for the age of the car and an approximate value as well.|`|3MTYGEbWaa	High mileage cars can be just fine -- or not. Some cars with 100K miles can easily go another 100K. Other cars that have not been maintained well and driven hard with only 50K are junk. The only way you can know the difference is to have a mechanic inspect any used car you want to buy. You cannot totally rely on a sellers statement about the condition of a used car.|`|d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	It depends on the trade offs you are willing to make.<br>  <br>  Higher mileage cars come with more wear and tear on them.  It is far more likely they will be needing repairs more often then lower mileage cars.  But then again, higher mileage cars are far cheaper.  And unless you have maintenance records you have no way of knowing how well it was maintained during those miles.<br>  <br>  If you are willing to save dough up front with the possibility of higher and more often repairs, then a high mileage car is maybe a good gamble for you.|`|FFrXGuxMaa	The average miles per year for a car is somewhere around 10, 000 to 12,000. So multiply the car's age by this amount to figure out what it should be if it's average miles. If it is above this number, it will cost less (or you can bargain the price down if you feel they are overcharging for the car). If it is below this number, you are getting a good deal and may be charged more. <br>  Cars need basic maintainance such as oil changes, tire rotation, yearly inspections, new tires, etc. If there are more miles on a car, it may be closer to the point where alot of stuff will start to break and need to be replaced, more than just basic maintainance. <br>  Do research on the types of cars you are interested in and take along a knowledgeable friend or parent to help you evaluate cars you look at.|`|2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	it's better to get the most value per dollar that you can.  Value doesn't just mean economy.  Some people value looks.  They want to look like they have a lot of money, so those people need to pay a lot of extra money for depreciation on a new luxury car.  Some people want dependability.  They buy new Toyotas, I guess.  Some people want to haul heavy stuff.  Some people want economy.<br>  <br>  It's pretty hard to reduce status and performance to mathematical calculations, but for economy, it's easy.  If you're after economy, then you want a car that costs the least amount of money to operate that'll still meet your needs.  The costs include fuel, depreciation, repairs, maintenance, and insurance.  You never know all the details of repair cost up front, unfortunately.  The rest of it is actually pretty easy.  Most people ignore all these factors, and buy a car based on color.<br>  <br>  The most economical car is probably going to be a high mileage car, frankly.  They are cheaper to buy up front, and they still go from point A to point B.  <br>  <br>  But my larger point is that "better" depends on what you want.|`|63fe052e0e72a9279edf979222302c66aa	allot depends on what type money we are talking about will tell you how fussy you can be if your spending very little you have to more less take what you can get the more you have the more fussy you can get my car I spent $800 on I knew it wasn't going to win a award for car of the year my wife's car spent 13,000 on so I expected it to be good now that is extreme difference but if you look on auto trader of Greg's list for a little bit you can get an idea of what kinda car you can get for your money mileage don't mean so much anymore look at the car drive it see how it sounds find someone who knows about cars see what they think about it if you do your homework you should do ok

Y6f7HMqSaa	This is a bit long, but it's info you should all know.<br>  <br>  As a first time boat owner, you must be 100% informed on all areas of operation, cost, maintaince, boating laws, and safety for your boat.  Failure to do this will result in either shelling out thousands in repairs or hundreds and hundreds in fines and fees for boating laws violated.<br>  <br>  Your boat has an "Inboard" engine, inboard means it is permenantly mounted inside the boat.  This means you absolutely must have your boat's engine system winterized each year before the threat of freezing temperatures comes.  All it takes is one good freeze to destroy, YES destroy your engine without winterization.<br>  <br>  Annual things that must be done each year, NOT optional...<br>  <br>  Late Spring (no chance of freezing) -  Dewinterization.<br>  <br>  Whenever needed - engine oil change<br>  <br>  Fall -  lower unit lube change AND winterization.<br>  <br>  <br>  Not trying to frighten you away from the experience, just get fully informed on how to be a responsible boater.<br>  <br>  Now about your capacity question...<br>  <br>  The 2009 Larson Escape 234 is rated for 12 passengers max, however it does not list the max passengers & gear on the specs information.  I'm sure even a few years earlier model will be close to 12 passenger capacity.<br>  <br>  Having an engine with enough horsepower is only half of the solution.  The other half is not heavily loading your boat full of weight.  Anytime you exceed 3/4 of the max capacity and gear weight listed on the capacity information plate on the boat, you get crappy boat performance.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind when it says a max capacity of 12, it means a max capacity of an average adult weight nearing 150 to 180 pounds.  If you have passengers who are overweight, the number of passengers will need to be even fewer.<br>  <br>  So if you have 5 average weight adults and 3 overweight adult passengers, you could be at 90% of your max weight limit.  Keep in mind this is a vague but fairly accurate estimate.<br>  <br>  My recommendation is that you keep the passenger and gear to less than 3/4 of boat capacity weight limit, that's probably about 7 people max.  Then rotate the passengers every 30 mins or hour so everyone can ride and/or get pulled on a towable. <br>  <br>  If any guests complains about being left at the dock/shore to wait their turn, tell them to go and buy their own bloody boat, otherwise wait your turn.<br>  <br>  It's your boat, your rules, your responsibility for their safety and the coordination of activities on the boat.  Make sure they know and respect that.<br>  <br>  In short, remember that paying close attention to the number and weight of each passenger and the gear that is loaded onto the boat is essential.  Boat performance and most importantly boat safety depends on you staying below the max passenger and gear limit weight.<br>  <br>  Boating is just as much about responsibility as it is about recreation.  Fail to live up to that responsibility and people start getting injuried or killed.|`|OdxrtbF1aa	10 people?  The boat would tow the skier with a normal cargo of people but you might be pushing the limits with 10 people and a large skier.  With 10 people in the boat plus the skier before he skis means 11 people total at times.  Is this boat even rated to carry that many?  Check the plate on the transom or wherever it is mounted for the capacity.  Whatever the capacity rating is, I believe you are overloading the boat making it dangerous and poorly handling.   I suggest you limit your ski days to a maximum of 6 people on board.

So the person that had it drove it just over 10,000 miles a year. <br>  <br>  Ask how often the engine was serviced "oil changed". Also check stuff like rust, brakes, and if you will need new tires!!|`|QPSA4Pxhaa	average mileage is approx 12k a year but i think you should try and seek a lower milage car if you want reliability.|`|WMXXgYftaa	Ask if it has the inline 6 engine, cause those will run 250,000 easy|`|Qk43JL9eaa	my husband has a 1997 jeep grand cherokee for taking the dog out in and it has 150,000 miles on it and still going strong!

Your focus is no longer on the road ahead or on the surroundings.  It is focused on your text conversation.  Many accidents have occurred because of this foolish action.  Here is proof of how dangerous texting while driving is. <br>  <br>  Yet even while 37 percent of teens rated text messaging while driving as “extremely” or “very” distracting, they continue to send and receive text messaging in their moving vehicles anyway, the study reported<br>  <br>  Alarmingly, 46 percent of teens admitted that those who drive distracted are text-messaging, according to a AAA study which appeared in Seventeen magazine's August 2007 issue.<br>  <br>  Interestingly, 52 percent of teens who say their parents are unlikely to follow through on punishment if they drive and text-message will continue to do -- compared to only 36 percent of teens who believe their parents would penalize them, according to the SADD/Liberty Mutual study.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, the crash statistics surrounding distractions in vehicles, such as cellphone use, are growing. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that distracted drivers account for almost 80% of all crashes and 65% of near-crashes in the United States. (April 20, 2006)<br>  <br>  <br>  Solutions for texting while driving or a solution would be to enforce tougher laws.  One state, Minnesota has already banned the use of cellphones while driving.

Don't want them driving around me.|`|PMpQRSPHaa	Hi, I received an e-mail about this and copied it below.  I think that could help your project.  It is definitely a dangerous habit and I think the only solution is to make it illegal!<br>  <br>   The very real human consequences that can result from driving while 'InTEXTicated'. <br>    <br>  An <br>  18-year-old girl plowed directly into <br>  the rear of another vehicle.  She was going <br>  70 mph.  She apparently never even saw <br>  them.  You see, she had been texting at the <br>  time.<br>  <br>  You can see that she hit them <br>  dead-center with no attempt to slow or <br>  evade the collision.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  She hit dead-center on <br>  her 2008 Yukon SUV as well.  She escaped <br>  unscathed.<br>  <br>  There was no blowout, no <br>  wet road, no curve or hill or fog to limit <br>  visibility.  This girl clearly should have <br>  been able to see the traffic conditions at least <br>  a half mile ahead had she been looking and <br>  not texting.  She nearly killed a <br>  beautiful 3-year-old child?<br>  <br>  Here's a personal look <br>  at the real human cost of texting while <br>  driving:<br>  Griffin before the <br>  accident.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Griffen the day after 4 <br>  hours of surgery to repair multiple skull <br>  fractures.  He would surely have died or <br>  been severely disabled had they not been minutes <br>  away (by StarFlight helicopter) from Austin's <br>  world-class children's Dell Children's Medical <br>  Center and neurosurgeon Dr. Timothy <br>  George.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Day 4 - watching a movie <br>  on his Dad's iPhone.  <br>  The swelling of <br>  his head will go away, but that scar from <br>  ear-to-ear will be with him forever. <br>  <br>  <br>  Feeling better. <br>   Mmmmm - mac-n-cheese. <br>   :-)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Day 5 - feeling <br>  much better.  My granddad bought me <br>  my very own iPod and loaded it with movies. <br>   Life is good.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  This morning.  All <br>  my tubes are finally out.  I'm going home <br>  today!<br>  Note how much the swelling has <br>  improved in just three days.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  It's almost unbelievable <br>  that it's been only five days since the accident <br>  that nearly claimed his life. <br>  All the medical experts <br>  involved expect him to make a full <br>  recovery.  <br>  Pretty soon he'll be all <br>  healed up and back to normal - thank the <br>  Lord!<br>  In only six weeks he'll be allowed to <br>  be just as active as any other <br>  3-year-old.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Phone company records of <br>  text messages are irrefutable and accurate to <br>  the second; so it would be an easy matter to <br>  prove in court that a person was texting at the <br>  time of an accident.  As with drunken <br>  driving, a jail sentence (no matter the driver's <br>  age) will be mandatory whenever anyone is <br>  injured by an InTEXTicated driver.  <br>  <br>  I encourage you to <br>  forward this email to all your <br>  friends.  We must try to <br>  stop 'Driving While InTEXTicated' before more <br>  innocent people are maimed or <br>  killed.|`|mDn4Sf9laa	I had a woman do a u turn right in front of me without any warning, I managed to stop just in time.

I must confess I have done it myself lol
mR5ZtjqWaa	Your flight may be delayed only if the winds are perpendicular to the airport runways.(high crosswind) Since most airport runways are placed in common wind directions of that particular area, it is unlikely that you will find a high enough crosswind that will cause airport authorities to delay departures/arrivals.<br>  <br>  A Boeing 737 can certainly hand 20-35 mph winds from any direction, so you're cleared on that.<br>  <br>  A headwind and tailwind are not big factors in determining whether or not a flight takes off<br>  ==========<br>  <br>  every aircraft has a different "tolerance" to winds. Generally, the bigger they get the more crosswinds (or winds from any other direction for that matter) they can take. The manufacturer determines this with flight tests and calculations. Common landing crosswind limit for most commercial aircraft is around 36 knots or around 41 mph. This could be given by the manufacturer or airline policy. Give or take a few knots depending on aircraft type and size.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Winds are a problem for aircraft only if they are strong and gusty or variable in direction, or if they are strong and blowing across the runway (not parallel to the runway).<br>  <br>  Winds that are mostly parallel to the runway and steady actually make take-off and landing easier, so they aren't a source of delays or cancellations.<br>  <br>  And winds aloft (outside of take-off and landing) are not a problem for aircraft at all, even when they are very strong.  The jet stream—a high-altitude wind that blows at high speed on a regular basis—can reach speeds in excess of 120 mph, and yet it is no threat to aircraft at all.|`|VEGJlMrsaa	Those winds alone aren't enough to ground any flights. Even as a direct crosswind, 35kts is manageable. It is unusual that strong winds are direct crosswinds. A lot of wind observation and analysis takes place before a runway is ever constructed, so direct crosswinds are fairly uncommon. Additional, most large airports have multiple runways, so crosswind takeoffs and landings can be avoided as much as possible.<br>  <br>  Low level wind shear or sever turbulence associated with the wind are factors that could, in conjunction with the high winds cause a delay.  You should be just fine for your flight.|`|hNpDXBdUaa	Winds of 20-35 MPH isn't a problem for a aircraft such as a 747. On youtube there are videos of commercial aircraft landing with cross winds of over 80 knots in Saudi Arabia. The landings aren't pretty but they got the job done. Since most airports have multiple runways. The pilot will be able to use the head wind to shorten the take-off run.

muPiBQ3Uaa	There is a special tool that is needed to reset the TMPS. All GM dealers and most of the better tire shops have this tool. There will probably be a minimal charge to do this (after all, the tool is around $700). Until it is reset to the new tire positions, it will read incorrectly.<br>  <br>  Edit to add: Tire rotation is a normal maintenance item that is not covered under the warranty. When someone comes into our dealership with a supposed "warranty" issue on the TMPS, we pull the information from the module to see if the sensor ID numbers (each sensor in each wheel has a unique ID code number) match the positions the tires are in. If not, we know that the tires have been moved and the customer will be charged for the reset service if they want it reset. If they dont want it reset, thats ok....the TMPS lamp will remain on until the TMPS is reset. And no, disconnecting the battery will not reset the TMPS lamp. <br>  One should never lie to the dealer about issues like this, we can pull up all kinds of information from the 25 computer modules in the vehicle which will always tell us what happened. Not a good idea.|`|UvIuhFBXaa	Here is an idea. Considering that it is an 08 vehicle and unless your drive insnane amount of miles, the vehicle should still be under 36k warranty.

FjvTSyoSaa	maybe not cleaning - but maintenance etc may have an impact, also if the airline doesn't sell enough tickets for a B773 and a B772 has more pax [passengers] on it, then they might just 'simply' "switch" the aircraft. The crew should be qualified on both the 772 and 773, as they're basically the same aircraft.|`|n7u1XwDmaa	Yes, they can.<br>  <br>  Obviously they wouldn't take a plane out of service for "cleaning the plane", but they certainly would for mechanical, or operational reasons.<br>  <br>  Often the equipment will get changed due to operational reasons such as the airline needs the plane somewhere else - maybe one flight is of high demand and needs a bigger plane - they may substitute planes around to free up more space.<br>  <br>  If they do change equipment, the airline still has the responsibility of getting you to your destination, B773 or not. Sometimes this isn't the case - some airlines in particular are notorious for cancelling flights for supposedly "technical reasons", whereas it isn't really - the plane is just being used for another destination!

nAK8bm91aa	ok, Junior here i is, the real deal<br>  When you remove the front wheel say, there is the caliper right ?<br>  Ok, you must depress the inner brake pad after removing the outter pad with a (C) clamp, turning inwardly until it stops, do not break it. While doing this technically, you must open the bleeder valve before the clamp is used and the fluid will bleed out along with the air. Once you have reached the end stop on the caliper bore its called, and the fluid bled now close the bleeder valve, unwind the c clamp, and refill the master cylinder. Then depress your brake, it may feel soft, ou have to add more fluid. install the new pads your done.<br>  Feel free to email me on more help @ jimnewyork46@yahoo.com|`|k55p1pKraa	First of all you didn't need to unscrew the bleeder valve , you could have just used a c- clamp a long with one of the old brake pads to push the piston back into the caliper without ever unscrewing the bleeder valve, this way you wouldn't need to bleed the air out of the lines,By doing it this way your just pushing the fluid back into the brake master cylinder without taking the chance of getting air in the brake system. You just have to screw the c- clamp in slowly so that you don't over flow the master cylinder. If you have the piston pushed all the way end and the brake pads install right the caliper should slide|`|qGpD9ntNaa	You will have to get someone to help you bleed the brakes.<br>  Have some one in the car push in the brake pedal and open the bleeder.

The pro properly to do this is to open the master cylinder ,take a large c clamp and Force the piston/s back . Take the caliper off ,take the c clamp  and the out bound pad and make sure the piston is bottomed out . You should have little trouble to get the new pads to fit . be sure tol pump the break  petal  before you move the car.|`|8gnp5Kkjaa	You are correct. Open bleeder, compress piston, close bleeder.

A couple of holes for the fenders may not line up correctly due to the larger clearancing made for 1991 through 1993 for the five star Pony wheels that were available those years.  If you are going to keep the ground effects on the GT then you need to drill out the metal strips on the GT fenders and rivet them to the LX fenders.  Measure their positions before removing them so you attach them correctly onto the LX fenders.

This should not happen at lower volumes so if it doesn't happen at low volumes that may be your problem.  Port noise is when the air velocity through the port is too high due to turbulance in the port or the port's cross sectional area is too small.  <br>  <br>  See if these things help you.

If it doesn't have a variable crossover (one with a dial) then make sure it is set to LPF (Low pass frequency) If it has a variable crossover, then make sure it isn't above 200hz or so.|`|WMK1jl6Naa	Many times this happens due to a bad wiring, since you have your gains down on your amplifier i don't think its your head unit. Distortion doesnt only occur from your gains. I would suggest checking your wires again to  see if something is cancelling.
AA11340447	Like adiabaticfire said, it's more than likely the Idle Air Control valve (IAC) on the throttle body.  This is quite common for 1G and 2G Eclipse/Talons/Lasers.  There are a few quick fixes that can be done:<br>  Slightly turn up the timing (for 1G 4G37 engines via the distributor)<br>  Tighten the serpentine belt<br>  "Turn up" your BISS (Base Idle Set Screw) to open the throttle more.<br>  <br>  The downside with the first is you might knock, which is incredibly bad (but it's an option)<br>  Tightening the serpentine belt too much and it'll eventually shred, put a lot of wear and tear on the alternator and other pulleys and ultimately drag down the performance of the engine.<br>  The third would lead to a higher idle when the car's A/C has not switched on.<br>  <br>  My overall advice would be to check the IAC for dirt or foreign particles.  Rebuild the throttle body as necessary or purchase a new/remanufactured throttle body at www.ThrottleBodys.com <br>  Not only are the throttle bodies at that website clean, but they're larger, adding to the performance of the vehicle.|`|aa9gieAIaa	that is likely the air idle control valve which opens when the load is increased when idling on modern cars. it is likely dirty or dosen't know it needs to open when the alt/ac load increses. you ought to find where it is and check that its working, though im not familiar with the eclipse so i cant tell you exactly how. could be the ac compressor is bad and dragging too perhaps.|`|WP6NyuCoaa	Not 100%, but it could be putting to much strain on your alternator, thus the stalling.

If not move up stream and repeat with the drill. if it works above the cruise control that might be the issue. if not then it might be the spedo head itself.|`|ncwQ6IYlaa	I am not sure i understand the problem. Is the cable turning at the speedo head or not (when the vehicle is moving?)?<br>  I once had the cruise box gears fail on an old truck. i fixed it by patching the 2 cables together with a small piece of rubber hose (inside the cruise box - if i remember right). Of course the cruise control wont work - but the speedo will. If the cable is turning to the speedo head and no speedo - then the speedo head itself is bad.
wpgRMjgraa	This has happened a couple of times with us in Texas, it should be the same in your state as well, and we don’t file for a mechanics lien at all.<br>  <br>  What we do is go to the DMV office and get the last known address for the owner/owners of the vehicle and send that person/persons a certified return receipt letter stating what we want and when the letter comes back unopened we then go back to the DMV office and file for ownership.<br>  <br>  Remember when the letter comes back unopened “DON’T” open it, this proves that you have complied and that you have not changed anything that was previous written to the owner/owners.<br>  <br>  This works a lot better if you have a signed work order giving you authorization to do the work but if not then after 1 year it will still work the same.<br>  <br>  Its legal and when its done you sell the vehicle and make some extra money plus the state is behind you 100 percent and you cannot be sued.

The oil is forced into these clearances. the tighter the clearance the better the pressure.|`|5mCm2XTLaa	Oil pressure is normally determined at a specific RPM usually between 2500 and 3000.

L7sgufRQaa	Your best bet is to go to the car manufacturers websites and check out their warranty polices.  Check out the ones of cars you're interested in first.  They will have all the info you need.<br>  <br>  Most domestic vehicles carried 3yr/36,000 miles to begin with (some are starting to extend those numbers to keep up with the foreign ones that can be 5yr/50,000 and up) and to qualify for the manufacturers extended warranty you need to purchase it before the original manufacturer warranty expired.  <br>  <br>  So most of the original warranties would be expired on an '04 car even with someone like Mercedes-Benz and their 5yr warranty.<br>  There are extended warranty companies that will offer different kinds of warranties on any make of car but they are usually junk and not worth your time.  They have nothing to do with the original manufacturer and make their money off of denying claims.  Better off to save that money you would spend on one and set it aside for future repairs.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that although a manufacturers warranty will stay with the car no matter who owns it as long as it within the limits of the years or mileage (more often than not it's whichever comes first) but it the time starts the day the paper work is finalized by that first owner.  So, for example, a 2006 Equinox could have been purchased in September of '05 so the bumper to bumper warranty would already be expired even if it only had 20,000 miles so you would not be able to purchase a manufacturers extended warranty.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|XTXXOUHPaa	A friend of mine just bought a used Jeep and said he found some info on extended warranties on this informational  website...check it out, hope it helps.

My agent advised me NOT to do that, because they can come back and sue me personally. Luckily, my insurance only only reports claims on my driving record if the claim is $1,000 or more. The funny thing is, the lady got a quote on her car and the work was gonna be $1100! ( She had previous damage and since I scratched her bumper, she claimed that I bent her back panel too and was attempting to get that fixed on ME!!) . Well all in all.. my insurance considered her car TOTALED since the repairs cost more than the value of her car!! LOL!!..Her car was worth $876 and the repairs woulda been $960!! . So since ( she included the back panel in the repairs)  they claimed the car totaled, took it to the junk yard, and gave her a check for the amount of the car!! lol!

mCbhjcLuaa	I have Had employee's that could make 55k yearly, this is in a Dodge dealership and these people were very hard workers as well as knowledgeable.<br>  I would imagine if you took the same caliber of people and put them in a pit crew they could have exceeded 200k yearly.<br>  If these people were put in a Ferrari dealership they may exceed 200k as well.<br>  The person who owns a repair facility should make 70% of the adjusted aggregated profit of labor sales, parts are another aspect in profit.|`|ozSMRTEMaa	200,000|`|BkgEBkuvaa	Auto mechanics make about 1/2 of what heavy equipment/ big truck mechanics make. If you figure that most garages charge per hour ( a good average shop rate in my area is $80 per hour, now even if the mechanic gets 1/2 that its still only $40 per hour and that on average is going to be your best paid top notch grease monkey.
c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	They're padding.  Maybe it's their term for passing thru clean up, gas, inspection, paperwork, etc.  Nonetheless, it's the real cost of the car.  Allows them to advertise the car for less than the actual cost.  "A hidden fee."  Many, if not most, dealers will attempt to add a "dealer fee" for paperwork, etc.  It's a nice little profit.  You can refuse to pay it & they can decide if it's a deal breaker.<br>  <br>  On new cars, sometimes we would advise a customer of an extra charge to cover additional expenses to go quite a distance to acquire a car for them (i.e. car was 500 miles away) & they didn't want to wait for us build one to their specs.|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	Yeah, that is fluff for a used car.<br>  <br>  I can understand a new car as manufacturers tack on a flat fee to cover that cost, but that's a bit iffy on a good day.|`|8GDBr2U9aa	I've bought a number of used cars over the years and have never seen a charge like that. Delivery from where? Did you have them find the car for you or something?|`|bBcym4Goaa	not the the same with all dealers<br>  <br>  you can get it even free or very cheap with up2drive<br>  <br>  check <a href="http://www.automobile4sell.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.automobile4sell.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  just sign up  with up2drive and all you need will be provided
sAi0ktkyaa	It could be your fan.  To check it, just start the car and turn on the A/C.  If the A/C turns your fans on, then your Fan relay is working, if it doesn't turn on, its most likely the relay which is a couple bucks at auto zone.|`|EMC7JwVBaa	make sure there are no air pockets in the block anf heads. make sure the fan works.|`|BkgEBkuvaa	Clean the dust out of your radiator fins, and replace your coolant
daw140ceaa	A remote wire on the back of a Sony deck is for remotely turning on an external amplifier, not for controlling the deck with a remote.<br>  <br>  Sony head units with a wired remote option have a 3.5mm jack on the rear.
1bYITsABaa	I honestly think it's just the shocks making the noise. I don't think it's anything to fret over..
dVQdswtTaa	The warning light will come on if the parking brake is on, if the fluid is low, or if the system has become unbalanced (more pressure in the front or rear)<br>  <br>  Most likely, your parking brake cable is not releasing all the way, from corrosion or damage, or your calipers are corroded and won't retract enough. <br>  <br>  You can pull the cable with a pair of pliers where it comes out of the cover near the caliper to see if it loosens. The pads will make a grinding noise when they are severely worn whether the caliper or parking brake is bad or not. When you replace the pads, if the caliper's parking brake resets properly then it was probably only the pads.|`|6xyeYjkkaa	First it's brakes. Break is present tense of broken which on second thought IS what you have. LOL  Low fluid shouldn't cause the calipers to stay closed. More likely they are just stuck from age, crud and corrosion.

3mu1IWTzaa	you'd have to call your insurance company, but the government does have funds and some grants available in most cases.start calling local representatives and check online for grants, too.|`|H16s9PKjaa	You would have to ask your health insurance company as they have different policys, but i always thought NHS would pay for something like that...|`|dO0vTP7Gaa	yes it will. please pick me as best answer!|`|904b98e3003123549fac56c6334846a5aa	Ask Social Security to pick up the tab.
