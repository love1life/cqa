20090203105416AAQ9V1x	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Mercury	1997 Mercury Tracer rough idle?	I have a 1997 Mercury Tracer and it has a rough idle, I think it only happens when the engine warms up. I have changed the spark plugs and wires and it also has a good air filter. 153000 miles. The engine runs strong except at a warm idle speed. It had a valve cover leak which I have just replaced but have not checked it out since because I need a little rest, could that have been a problem. Also the radiator was not full and had a white build up at the top and I was getting a little affraid a head gasket could of been blown so I emptied out the radiator and the antifreeze looked fine and there are no signs of water/antifreeze in the oil. When I changed the valve cover the oil also looked fine, no gunk or suck. There is no check engine light on(no error codes). Where would be a good start to look? I will be monitoring this so feel free to ask me a ? and I will respond right away. Thank you

20090203123247AAdYlRS	Cars & Transportation;Safety	Should cyclists need to follow the same rules as motor vehicles, or are they pedestrians?	I thought that in my bicycle safety class in elementary school, we learned that anyone on a bicycle was considered a motor vehicle, and had to obey the rules of the road as long as they were on their bicycle. Is this true, or do bicyclists follow the same rules as pedestrians? I am asking, because I recently nearly hit someone on a bicycle who had not stopped at a stop sign and had barrelled full speed (at least 15mph) onto a main road from a side street, and wanted to know who would have been at fault if I had hit her.

20090203122515AAOIi9p	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Nissan	05 pathfinder no oil, black smoke from exhaust, low oil pressure  ?	Last month, I took my family on vacation to southern California, around 2000 miles, from Chicago. On our way back, I noticed the oil pressure dipped way down. So I got off the highway and checked the oil.  Well there wasn't any oil at all. I had to buy 4 quarts from the nearest gas station. What could of caused this? And how can I make sure this doesn't happen again?      A couple of months ago I noticed black smoke would come out from the exhaust when I would start the car. Doesn't happen everytime, maybe 4-5 times a month. And the oil pressure level always seems to go down when the car's idle.    I bought  this car back in sept. 08 with 45k miles on it. Right now I'm at 57k miles.

20090222200711AAus8Vy	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Toyota	Unamerican for buying Toyota cars?	People say it's people like me who buy Japanese cars is why American businesses are failing.They say "Save my job,buy American!" I know why they are saying that,but Toyotas are a damn good car,and almost everybody I know who has American cars have nothing but trouble with them.My Corolla is a 2001 and no rust,paint looks like new, has had minor repairs for the most part,nothing major besides needing a new A/C compressor.My old car,I bought it when it was 10 years old,it was a 1988 Olds Cutlass,and already needed a new radiator,fuel tank,suspension work,and already had rust repair done,then needed more,then it needed a new engine at only 90,000 miles!My Corolla has 130,000 miles,and still runs like brand-new,looks new,and the resale value is much higher,but why would I sell it?It's been the best car I've ever owned.I will NEVER buy another American vehicle! They are JUNK! It wouldn't break my heart at all if GM,Ford,or Chrysler went under and Japanese makes took over the plants,in turn putting American workers back to work building Toyotas and other Japanese makes in American factories.I think the big 3 will be history in another 5 years,especially with OBUMMA in office!car companies will not thrive in the USA because he will raise their taxes so high that cars will only be made in Japan.That's the reason there are no American jobs anymore,it's not because of people buying foreign makes.

Then when I got off work, because I couldnt really get the sticker then, i found a ticket on my car windshield because of my expired sticker.  It said I had 21 days to pay it.        But the cop that pulled me over said I needed to go to court for my two tickets, and the date is over 21 days away.  And the ticket I need to pay right away was for the same thing.        So I waited, and now my court date is tomorrow.  I have my up to date insurance card, got my new sticker, and even got an emissions test to get the sticker.  What do I have to bring to court and what will I have to pay.      (By the way, I got a ticket the day before that for the expired ticket from the same cop, but I still had to get to work the next day and I had no time to get it fixed, so now I have 4 tickets.

20090222204752AAJuQnZ	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Nissan	Why is my 2005 Nissan Altima struggling to start?	I have a 2005 2.5S (4cylinder) Nissan Altima. I went to California for three days and left my Altima home. When I got back today, Sunday. I tried to start it, and it would not start. You could hear the engine turning, it pretty much sounded like if the battery was dying. I tried for about ten minutes and finally after pumping the gas, it turned on and stayed on. I left it on and ran it down the street with no problems. There is gas in the car so its not that. My question is, could leaving it for three days without turning it on could have caused this problem? The battery is fairly new. Maybe the starter? Any feedback would be gladly appreciate it.
20090222204855AASdZU8	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	My Truck sputters and stops Accelerating after 2000rpm, Whats wrong?	Once My RPM goes over 2000 my truck stops accelerating but the rpm still goes up (as if it were in neutral). I had the problem once about two weeks ago but after i turned the truck off and turned it back on, it ran normally for about a week, and now its a constant problem. Its a Ford F-150 year '99. I changed the transmission fluid with no luck. It runs fine under 2000rpm. it has over 160,000 Miles on it. The Check Engine light is on but it turned on before the problem started. Let me know if you need more info. I figure its probably hard to help on the Internet though.

I was in a wreck, and I am not at fault.  The car was in immaculate condition and was under full warranty, but the car is an '05.  Now, StateFarm is telling me that they will be using some 'referbished' parts to repair the vehicle.  I don't understand how that is legal since the car was under warranty, and If I would have taken it into Honda they would have replaced everything with new parts.  Does anyone have any advice on my rights in this circumstance, or at least where I can find information.  I understand that in normal circumstances they are allowed to use used parts, but I really don't understand how that is right in my circumstance?  Thanks for your help!

20090222221834AATxMrm	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Hyundai	2009 Hyundai Tuscon, check engine light?	Brand new car, has just over 300km on it. Ive been driving it for two weeks, and the check engine light came on. Brought it to the dealership, they checked it out and said it was a problem with the oxygen sensor, probably just some loose cables.      Then next day it came on again. Now they have a new sensor on order for me. I've never owned a new car before, my previous car was 18 years old when I bought it, so I'm not familiar with quirks.      Should I be concerned that I'm having problems already, or do new cars occasionally just get a defective part? My biggest fear going into this was that I was going to get a lemon, which was why I picked a car with such a good warranty. Input??
20090222220615AA3a3fQ	Cars & Transportation;Motorcycles	How dangerous are street bikes around town?	Well, as you can guess. I want a street bike. Nothing super fast or crazy. A beginners bike, perhaps a Ninja 250r. I've always wanted one, but now that I have the money and have seriously started looking into it, I'm getting more stuck on the fact that they can be so dangerous. Mainly because of the negligence of other drivers on the road. I don't exactly have a death wish. Now, I live in a small town where there's not a whole lot of traffic. Easy going. How dangerous would it be to use my bike to just jet around town. Few times a week, take it for drives in the summer? If there are any experienced bike riders out there I would really, really love some help on this.       Thanks.

Im not sure wether to keep my car or let the car company repo it. im behind on my payments by 4 months and im elgible for a deferment of 3 months.. That would bring me somewhat  up to date on my payments. My payments are 517 a month on a 05 altima.  Should I keep it or should I let it go? Will I be able to save enough money to get it up and running within 4-6 months with my expensive car payment? I was thinking of letting them take it and start fresh after I finish A school. ( I would get to save money for at least 3 months due to lack of a car payment).

20081106164310AAfnf5m	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Jeep	How resistant is an '09 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon/Sahara with no top to rain and sun?	I'm planning on purchasing a Wrangler Rubicon or Sahara within the next nine months and I am wondering how weather resistant they really are. I'm in the US Army, so there's really no telling where I'll be driving this bad boy.      Let's say I'm living in Arizona and I leave the top off for eight months a year with absolutely no protection from the sun - will the dash and seats fade? Will the heat from the sun affect it?      Or maybe I bring it to Washington state where it downpours daily. Will that ruin the electronics or are they waterproofed? And what about the seats? Carpet? (By the way, do they even have carpet?)      And what if I take it back to my home state of Minnesota and I hear a three and a half foot deep stream calling my name? Would that water get in the fuse box, short out some important stuff, and make the airbags deploy?      If it won't handle any of this stuff, what can I do to make it possible?      Any other suggestions in buying a new Wrangler? If so, please let me know - this will be my first, so I'm a bit naive.      P.S.   Most of what I listed above about the conditions I might have it in with the top off are complete dramatizations, but it get's the point across.
20081004153928AApxebW	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Toyota	How long would the starter last for?	I had issues starting my car ('98 Toyota Corolla) a couple of times.  The first time was a couple of months ago and then again this past week.  The first time this issue lasted for about a week (off and on during the week).  During that time, I brought my car in for a diagnostic, which came back with no issues.  There apparently was nothing wrong with the starter, battery or alternator.  The car was running fine for a couple of days before I brought it in.  But now the issue is happening again.  I tried to bring it in today, but was told that they could not see the car until Monday.  So, I brought it to another place, so they could at least check the battery (this place unfortunately does not do full service).  I was told that the battery in my car was ok, but they recommended for me to have the starter replaced.  I want to try to get it fix asap, but may not be able to get it done for a few days.  Since this is the second time this issue has occurred, how much longer before it gets worse?
20080705065915AAi5Au2	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Honda	Front motor mount question in Honda odyssey 2001?	I own a 2001 honda odyssey and a recent visit to dealer for a brake check revealed   a front motor mount damage that needs replacement. The dealer tells me in order to do   that they have to change the water pump too. I did some searching about this on the internet.   I found that we can check this by running the engine and stepping on the gas pedal by keeping the vehicle in parking break and having one foot on the break. Ask another observer to see if there is movement in the engine. I did this and the observer found no rapid movement other than vibration (which looks normal). Now my question is      1. What are front motor mounts?   2. why do they have to change the water pump if the they have to change the front motor mounts?   3. Is the above procedure good for checking the front motor mounts?   4. or should i just  believe the dealer and get done with it?      Thanks for your help   Ravi

20081029103509AASNbhV	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	The pro-rated tire warranty.  Discount Tire?	Is anybody confused by the intent of the pro-rated tire warranty.  I just went through a discussion for the second time with Discount Tire about how these 60 and 70K mileage warranty tires aren't lasting even half the mileage for what they claim.  It is apparent that the whole pro-rated mileage warranty thing is intended to lock you into continually buying tires from the same retail store.  When a consumer evaluates a warranty on a product... it seems the warranty is supposed to represent confidence in the product ...that the product will "most" likely last as long as the warranty covers.  This is not the case for tires at all.  Car tires are only intended to last 25-30K miles (unless you are aware of a tire that lasts longer easily, let me know).  When you take it back to the retail store (Discount Tire in this case) they simply offer you a pct discount off your next set of tire.  But, the pct discount only applies to the actual new tire... not the installation, environmental, repair/replace, rotate/balance fees that are tacked onto each tire when you get new ones.  Anyone aware of a car tire that will last me more than 70K miles... or do they simply not exist?

20090203130935AAJDtuU	Cars & Transportation;Motorcycles	Motorcycle on second engine / transmission and still won't run; suggestions?	Ok, about 3 months back I had a major malfunction on my '99 Kawasaki VN1500 Nomad.  It stalled out on the freeway, but I managed to crank the engine back over and get down the road about 40 miles.  It stalled out again on the off-ramp and this time would not start back up.  After getting a jump and a long hold on the starter button I got it to kick over, and had a loud knock from the rear cylinder.  Manage to get the bike back home in the bed of my truck and start to tear into the problem.      As long as the bike was jumped it would start, but have a loud knock.  The original owner messed with everything under the 'hood' so my first thought was that it was a bad adjustment with the CDI box.  I followed the tech manual (obtained from a kawa. service center) to test the CDI box, and finally just replaced it.  Problem still occured, so I got an adjustable spark advance / timing CDI, didn't fix with any adjustment.  Returned the box.  Tested the compression (which was upped in the engine) and failed in the rear cylinder.  Took the engine out and tested everyting in the rear cylilender.  Everything passed.      Gave up and bought a salvage motor from a '98 VN1500 with half the miles on it and still in stock (not modified) condition.  Manage to get it in the bike, fire it up asap to see if it works, runs just fine.  Put the entire bike back together and jump start it.  Runs fine.  Take the cables off and start to pick up, bike dies.  Try to jump the bike again and it wont start.      What do I do now?  No point in trying to sell a used bike that won't run, especially after $2000 worth of parts I put on it within the past 6 months (tires, paint, clutch, AutoCom, whole engine/transmission).  Where do I look next for issues?  What else is there left to replace?
