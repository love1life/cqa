215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	My daughter will be 3 on March 10th. She did the same exact thing when I put underwear on her, just pee or poop in them and it didn't seem to bother her at all that she was dirty and wet. I put a maxi pad in her underwear instead of letting her go back to diapers, it made less of a mess and she could still feel the wetness. This seemed to help with her feeling the wetness and recognizing that she went in her pants. The only thing that seem to work for my daughter was time. We did not push, we just let her decide she was ready to be potty trained. We have her tons of praise and treats/stickers when she did go on the potty and showed her where her poop and pee is suppose to go when she went in her pants. One day about 2 weeks ago she woke up and decided that it was time and has not even had one accident since then. She did it on her own on her own time. It sounds as though maybe this is what is going to happen to your son. I felt like my daughter was going to be the only 3 year old not potty trained but that was all just my worry there are plenty of 3 year olds out there not potty trained, I have several friends and family members who have children that are 3 that are still working on it, so don't worry! Best of luck to you!|`|DrbzkoSfaa	Try playing a game with him. i.e., put a little water in his potty and put a few cheerios in there. when you take him to the potty tell him to "target practice" by hitting the cheerios with his pee. He'll think its a game and possibly look forward to going potty.  Good Luck..<br>  <br>  Edit: this will also help him with his aim for when he is ready for the big boy toilet.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	well you dont decide when he is ready, he does, you are just there to help him. i recommend training pants, they do help alot.<br>  Sit him on the potty frequently and reward him when he uses it.... Boys do take a little longer to train and there will be accidents. If he uses the potty as a reward system from you, he will be more apt to using it... try a money jar, everytime he uses it give him a quarter, every time he pees in his pants, take one away, at the end of the week he spends his money as he wishes.|`|l8Ntr0ERaa	Well boys do tend to train slower and wait longer. The average is 3 I think. The light at the end of the tunnel is that no matter how frustrating it is now you can rest assured that he will not go to collage in diapers. I think when kids are ready they will "tell" you and then it will be really quick. Ask him if he wants to use baby diapers or pull ups. If he wants to use pull ups but is not fully ready for the all day and poop part that is OK. Most times this happens in parts, first going in the Am (your case) and then on to something else. Just try to relax and remember that when he's ready it won't be a struggle.|`|8RfmosODaa	I made a chart for my son and each time he would pee he got to put a sticker on the chart. After a few stickers he got a prize. Good Luck!
FA1rRzUxaa	I got my BFP on Saturday, am around 5 weeks pregnant. From the week leading up to when my period was due until a couple of days ago my boobs were agony. Now my boobs tend to hurt during the day but not so much in the evening.|`|Gf6V3vDBaa	Not at the moment!|`|BO28Mn8haa	i get the same every month during my period it sucks|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	Same here!! LOL!!!!|`|le0LsiVUaa	It happens just get someone to massage them for you;)|`|AA11661793	mine do that and i'm 16 weeks 3 days lol|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	Mine do they were sore 5 mins ago throbbing now their not. Happens all the time off and on. Im 12weeks...
T0gv52CDaa	Try feeding her before she gets hungry.  I know that it is harder to get my son t latch on if he is screaming because he is really hungry than if I just offer the breast to him when I know it has been a couple of hours since he last ate and that he will be getting hungary soon.<br>  <br>  Grapes & blueberries are the best snack food.  They require no work other than rinsing them off when you first bring them home, and my 2 year old can go into the refrigerator and get them himself without me having to cut anything up or heat something up.<br>  <br>  Meal replacement drinks don't provide nearly enough calories to support you and your baby.  In order to make milk, your body needs water, fat, & protein.  They tend to be really short on the fat & protein.  They are fine as a quick snack until you can get a real meal, but don't use them to replace a meal.|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	Breastfeeding - are you giving her a bottle? If so then this is probably the problem. If not please give more information about the breastfeeding - what is the problem?<br>  Meal replacements drinks - they are ok for a snack - vitamines, ect. but you should still consume three regular meals a day.|`|5jjGo6XTaa	if you are uncoffy wile breastfeeding so will the baby  im surprised your milk is still in if its been 9weeks and having problems you should invest in a breast pump|`|9b579e5d0c20c6295a54289ea1d57053aa	Hi there, I am a mom of 2 boys and currently breastfeeding my 6 month old and have been since birth. I breastfed my 1st son till he was 9 months old (he self weaned). I am a larger woman with large breasts and I find the best way to breastfeed is to lay down and do it. I lay on my side and bring my son in really close and he lays on his side and nurses away! When he was born I used a chair and one of those nursing pillows to prop him up and used the football or cadle position. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://video.about.com/breastfeeding/Breast-Feeding-Positions.htm" rel="nofollow">http://video.about.com/breastfeeding/Bre...</a><br>  <br>  As for snacks for you I would eat lots of fruits and veggies, granola bars, lots of water, milk, juice, yogurts, cheese, toast. Eat what you would normally eat but have a few extra calories. As for those meal replacements, I am not sure if they are good for you while nursing. I would ask a doctor on that one or maybe even a pharmacist. I also have a 3 yr old and he is a picky eater too. I have to force him to eat most of the time. He loves those small yogurts and cheese strings. He'll eat sandwich meats and loves pancakes. Right now I just make him what he likes so I know he's eating. I also give him a kids vitamin.|`|YEqQZgs5aa	You already got alot of great ans.. as far as meal replacement drinks.. as long as your still eating they are actually really good - throught my pregnancy I had 1 or 2 a day and now the baby is 4 months I still drink them - on top of eating to be sure I am getting enough calories and because they have a ton of viatmins in them too...<br>  <br>  BUT you dont want to drink say the slim fast ones - or ones for weight loss... Buy Ensure or Boost - those have around 250 calories in them.. and the Ensure Plus has 350 per drink...  I have actually been buying the walmart brand and I like them better than the ensure.. im not a fan of the boost ones!
WPI0Z47saa	Two years is the recommedation. One year is supposed to be important since you will just have to buy formula until then anyway. But the real answer is to let the child decide. I really wanted to get to the two year point but my son stopped on his own at 18 months. You do it as long as you and your child are comfortable doing it.|`|ft8t98Pnaa	as long as you want to feed her the milk... I mean its time for her to start eating baby food.. but she can still drink breast milk too.. I know people who have given their child breast milk until they were 3-4|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	Okay so how long do you breastfeed for??? As long as you want to. Most recommendations are for at least a year. <br>  For support groups call your local la lehce league. Remember that there is way more benefits then just creating a bond. The health benefits are not only for the baby but there is also health benefits for yourself and the longer you breastfeed (or pump) the better the benefits are.|`|KncPJwIaaa	Nine months and stop|`|sG00ks0Raa	umm my mom went to 10 months with me and im very healthy im 13 and have never had chicken pocks or any of that stuff i was a very healthy baby|`|FKR45WLPaa	If you feel like pumping is interfering with your time with her, stop.  And don't feel guilty about it.  She has gotten more nourishment than a lot of babies already.  I don't know of any support groups that are pump exclusive.  Go with your gut, you know better than the lactation nurses and doctors what is best for your daughter and yourself.|`|USoSsng6aa	The longer you do it, the healthier and better off she'll be. Some people do this until two years, so I'd say go for it and keep on until she's weaned if you can. If you can't, it's not the end of the world, but you're going to be switching breastmilk for formula and be spending time making that instead.|`|791NVofcaa	studies show that at least one year of nursing is the most beneficial...two years is better. in my opinion, you've been doing for 6 months now. what's the use in quitting!? it's the best thing for baby. and consider, too, that around one year of age they can start getting more of their nutrients from solids. you won't have to pump as much. don't give up mama!|`|jhPlVj0oaa	Try this site....
1279d49c535d896b11b907453f4ed733aa	I have not personally gone through this situation; although you do have my sympathies... it pains me to hear that a new life can't be appreciated by someone who helped to create it.  <br>  That being said - you (and your son) are probably better off.  If he puts drinking, parties and whatnot as a priority before the 2 of you, who knows what your son will grow up learning?!  Keep in mind though, that your son is depending on you now... you have to take care of yourself so that you can take care of him.  <br>  Also, just like they say... "If you wait until you are financially ready to have kids - you never will".  Same holds true for being emotionally (and - let's face it...) mentally ready to have kids.  Apparently this man was not/is not prepared to be a dad.  Best to find out now while your son really can't comprehend that; instead of when he's 5, 6 or even 10 or 11 years old (then you run into the "was it my fault he left" questions).  <br>  Just remember, any man can be a father - it takes something special to be a dad.  This man obviously doesn't have it (at least right now).  You can't force him into it.  Let him go - like you said, it's best that he's leaving anyway.  Concentrate on the 'new man' in your life :-)... take care of him the best you can... raise him to take responsibility for the choices he makes; to be the man you would like to see him become.  <br>  I wish you and your son the best of luck.|`|u94HOVz7aa	my husband went through this stage after our first one, got over it mostly we decided to have a second baby.  then when all his friends, who don't have babies, kept going out drinking, parting and what nots he got that itch.  there was nothing i could say or do that was right. he just got tired of having his life revolve around the kids.  i told him it wasn't doing me or the kids any good having him here miserable and mean all the time because he wanted to live the "single life"  so he left.  after a month he realized how much  he loved all of us and asked to come back.  i told him no he had to prove he was ready to come back i couldn't handle him getting that itch again.  it wouldn't be good for the children either to be bouncing in and out as he wanted or was convenient for him.  i told him he could come over and be around as much as he wanted, but i wanted him to be sure that is what he wanted before he came back.  well it wasn't long before he started telling his friends that going out was fun and all, but his family was more important. now he takes one weekend a month were he is "unattached" and can go out with his friends to do what ever and the rest of the time he is a wonderfully devoted husband and father. I don't know if that helps at all, but i wanted you to know that you are not alone some men get that way.|`|0viZhxi6aa	Not personally, but I know a guy who's 33 and acts the same way. He has 2 kids with the same woman but would rather spend time with his 25 year old friends drinking and smoking pot. They break up and get back together all the freaking time and it has those poor kids so screwed up, so I advise you to make up your mind one way or the other and stick with it. Or your kid will suffer................Good luck!|`|791NVofcaa	i haven't been in that exact situation, but my husband wasn't "all there" during my son's first 6 months. he had a computer game addiction (i'm being dead serious) and was playing 8 to 12 hours a day. we were on the brink of divorce and that eventually woke him up. if you feel that you have done what you can to get your significant other to realize what he has and he hasn't changed, move on. if he wants to become a father, he will come back at some point. but don't wait for him any longer. you should expect him to help out financially, however.|`|eq59nZJHaa	I know EXACTLY what you are saying, though my now husband was 21 when our daughter was born.  I tolerated it only for so long.  The best thing you can do is to be strong, stand firm and let him know that that lifestyle is not acceptable for you or your kid and that so long as he chooses that he isn't welcome to the family life.  Lay it out to him as a choice, if you want to live a single life, fine, be single then, but if you want to be with me it needs to be a family life, because that's what I'm looking for.  Express that you love him but need to do what's best for you and the baby and let him know if he decides to grow up you can't garuntee that he's still welcome but to let you know anyhow.  By playing totally cool about it and letting him figure it out for himself, it wont take long before he realizes where he needs to be.  I give him two weeks tops if he's worth it.  Something about not having the woman around to pick up the pieces makes them realize real quick that the single life isn't all it's cracked up to be.
uFrqC4Y2aa	Drink cold water or orange juice and lay on your side. Look for movements. I freak out often because I don't feel my daughter move.|`|kT7GVOosaa	at 19 weeks your boy still has lots of room to move without touching any part of you. not to mention that he isn't very big so many movements will go un noticed. another reason for no movement is that babies are only human. they have up and down days just like you. some days you want to do everything and other days you want to sit on the couch and do nothing. don't worry to much. stress isn't good for baby.|`|LFXTpqfdaa	Don't worry. At 19 weeks, the baby is still small and has a lot of room to float around. If he's facing your backbone or the placenta, you won't feel his kicks the way you will when he's facing your belly. <br>  <br>  Those pains you felt are just round ligament pains and are completely normal.<br>  <br>  Feel free to call your doctor to set your mind at ease.|`|AA11661793	He's still pretty small he could just be in a different spot, maybe behind something. If you are really worried about it call and check with your doctor.|`|3EiOobEVaa	I would probably make an appointment to see the doctor...but there is a possibility that the baby might be in a different place and you cant feel the baby move|`|le0LsiVUaa	I'd get checked asap. Even if it is okay it's best to be certain xx|`|eJMIazhLaa	If your baby is usually active during the day and you haven't felt him move much, then I would maybe make an appointment to be seen.  I was told that during the day, when you're more active and up walking around, the baby tends to sleep because there is a rocking motion with your movements.  If it's something that you're really worried about then make the appointment.|`|CjwIAvuwaa	Hi, I would get it checked out even if it turns out there is nothing wrong. Its best to be on the safe side. I have been feeling my baby move nearly every day but i know if you don't you start to worry, i have been prodding my belly to try and make it move.<br>  Hope everything turns out ok. x|`|ZvkX9uNraa	I am 19 weeks too, and some days my daughter is all over the place and some days I do not really feel her move at all. My OB told me not to expect to feel normal movements until 22-24 weeks so we are feeling the movements before we technically should. This is normal and all is likely well with your son. Good luck!|`|7a21abcf50668faa413ff2b682d8ddc2aa	dont panic. drink some orange juice or ice water, and lay on your left side and see if you can feel him move. 19 weeks is still a little early to feel constant baby movement. good luck. if the oj doesn't work, call the doctor, just to put your mind at ease!
VY4LqfLpaa	our son was born 2 months early so I'm glad I got a travel system.  I would just hook his carseat on for a while...but then I think at around 3 months when he was about 10 lbs I would put him in the stroller itself (reclined of course) for short periods of time.  He's 8 months old now and about 16.5 lbs and HATES to be in that carseat in the stroller...he likes to see where he is going...he actually hates to be in that little carseat period.  We started putting him in a convertable seat around 5 months old when he was about 13 lbs.|`|u94HOVz7aa	at any age you feel comfortable placing them there, i would suggest using the seat belt though.  most have a reclining seat for if your baby cant sit up by themselves or they fall asleep.|`|CE3bmj65aa	My son has hated being leaned back even the slightest bit, so starting about 2 months he would not ride well in the stroller unless he was in the actual stroller part so that I could sit him up a little more.  He has had great head control since he was born so I wasn't worried about that.  I even had to switch him to a convertible car seat because his infant seat reclines too much and he would just scream every time I went somewhere in the car.  I would say you could put a baby in at almost any age, but depending on the age and stability of the Baby's head would depend on how much you lean it back or sit it up.  I know my stroller seat goes flat, so a newborn baby could ride in it.|`|qsjGSXaRaa	My baby is almost 4-months old now and about 16lbs. We started using the stroller instead of the carseat because she seems to fuss less when we're out when she can see what's going on around her. It seems to me though, that even with a weeks-old baby, the stroller could be used if placed in the lowest reclined position so that the baby is fully laying down. We didn't do that but it does seem that it could safely be done since there's a full harness system just like in the carseat.<br>  <br>  We have the Eddie Bauer Endeavor Travel System btw,  which I don't recommend at all since it's way too bulky and difficult to maneuver.|`|TrUjyEJAaa	As long as a baby has strong neck support he can sit in the large stroller. At 5 months, I'm sure he is more than ready. If it looks like he is uncomfortable, you can always use blankets as added support or recline the seat a little bit. I started putting my daughter in the big stroller around 4.5 months. She seems way more comfy and loves being able to look out at the world while we walk.|`|2n0B4cY6aa	some pushchairs are from 3 months and others 6 months. I would type into google the pushchair you have and have a read on it|`|MCiSrm2Vaa	my daughter is 8 month old and 20lbs and she just started sitting in the stroller alone last month(so at about 7 months)
xwZKouCIaa	i'd say you hav epretty good chances of gettin pregnant being as tho you are currently in your most fertile days.. so go for it!  good luck!!
aJLx0nhNaa	Your body has been through the ringer recently.  My postpartum bleeding stopped and started several times. Adding on top of that that you've started the pill, recently stopped breastfeeding, and are dealing with the sleep deprivation/poor eating habits/stress of a new mom, it's really not surprising at all that you are bleeding sporadically.<br>  <br>  Bear in mind that it can take up to 8 weeks for your uterus to shrink back to normal size, depending on various factors including breast feeding.<br>  <br>  Ask your doctor, but I wouldn't stress too much.  There are too many totally understandable reasons why this would be happening.|`|O8MDQUrHaa	it could be anything, so u should ask your local dctor|`|lCs16a6kaa	the mini-pills dear<br>  <br>  a doctor once told me that the patients she had to put them on mini-pills are all walking around carrying pads in their bags cos they are expecting a bleeding at any time.<br>  <br>  the same happened to me and things didn't get back normal until i stopped them.<br>  <br>  Good luck

RKLFYS2Naa	Your son actually is trying to tell you that he is ready to move on and move out. He would like to get his own apartment, he's too old for you guys to keep babying him like this...<br>  <br>  I would suggest buying him a lamborghini and that way he can drive him self to and from his new place!! He would also like a pair of oakleys to match his new car...|`|Hf5doDxsaa	Maybe.  All babies learn at their own pace,  I would just work with him as much as you can.|`|OGCohFyNaa	My daughter was the same way. She didn't start crawling until 2 weeks after her first birthday and didn't start walking until she was 18 months old. I can't remember how old she was when she started rolling over and sitting up on her own, but it was MUCH later than what is considered "normal." <br>  We determined that there wasn't anything physically wrong with her and she didn't have any emotional problems that were causing it. She was overweight at the time, and my mother, who she stayed with for a while, catered to her every need rather than trying to help her gain some independence. Any time she would cry a bottle would be popped in her mouth immediately rather than seeing if she could figure out some problem solving skills and/or find ways to entertain herself. <br>  We talked with her pediatrician on multiple occasions and finally decided to enroll her in a state-funded program that is called Sooner Start. (I'm sure that they've got it all over, but what it's called elsewhere I couldn't tell you.)<br>  Basically what the people from Sooner Start did was this: At first they came to our home and ran a couple tests to determine where the exact problem was - whether it was her small motor skills or this or that... Then they came back periodically (at first it was once every 2 weeks, then once a month, etc) and worked with my daughter on the areas she was having problems with. They also showed us different techniques to strengthen her legs and arms, etc so she would start crawling and walking, etc. <br>  It helped out quite a bit. I would suggest talking to your pediatrician to see if there is something like that available in your area. <br>  Just a heads-up... My daughter just turned 4 last month and is 100% where she's supposed to be in terms of development. <br>  Best of luck!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I wouldn't call it laziness.  Maybe he just prefers looking around.
5RvTXdmUaa	Hi,<br>  If you are on the depo-provera shot, it is VERY unlikely that you are pregnant. Wait another coupe of days and if you don't start your period, and are too impatient to wait until your blood test Thursday, then take a home pregnancy test. By then, it should be accurate.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|eJB3gVYMaa	i'm not quiet understanding your question.. ok you think you might be pregnant but the tests are coming back negative, it could be a few things it could be that your preganancy hormone level is to low and it's not picking up enough  just wait for your next appoinment i'm sure things will turn out ok good luck!|`|mqNxYMuUaa	very confusing to read
d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	A woman is most fertile 14 days after the first day of her last period and sperm can live in the woman's body for up to 7 days if conditions are right. So if you have your period for 7-10 days, have unprotected sex the next day (say..day 11 after the first day of your period) there could still be live sperm inside you when you ovulate a couple days later. Plus of course our bodies are not perfect and we can technically ovulate at anytime during our cycle. I wouldn't say your chances are great, but def. there is a chance. if you don't want to be pregnant, use protection every time!|`|S4DNQkFraa	If you DON'T want to have a baby, then KEEP YOUR LEGS CLOSED! It's as simple as that.<br>  I'm getting so sick and tired of girls coming on here, freaking out! If you have sex, there is a chance of pregnancy. All you can do is wait til you miss your next period.|`|HjYP8YSNaa	you usually ovulate around a week after your period to a week before your period. This means you are probably LESS likely to get pregnant right after or right before your period. However, your period might not be that regular. Ovulation can occur at any time, even while you are on your period. Actually, no time is "safe" to have unprotected sex if you don't want a pregnancy.<br>  Hope it helps..|`|4KoeRr8naa	There's a chance, but it's small. <br>  <br>  But if I were you, I'd still be getting some Plan B, and then making an appointment at the local Planned Parenthood to talk about my birth control options.|`|afbab52ed0180d2887c29993b4dbdb8eaa	PLAN B... lol why not<br>  <br>  the new pill
AA11100890	Wow I just answered a similar question.  Yes, my baby and my cousin's had chorion cysts on their brain in their first ultrasounds.  You'd have to google chorion cysts because I forget what they actually are composed of- spinal fluid I think.  <br>  Anyways, they almost always go away by 28 weeks.  A repeat ultrasound can check on them.  If they don't go away, they can be an indicator of Trisomy 18- and this is where we moms get freaked out because the syndrome is really bad.  However, Trisomy 18 would have other physical problems that would show up on an ultrasound such as a cleft lip/palate, heart deformities, missing/extra toes or fingers etc.  <br>  If you've had one or two ultrasounds and are 20-some weeks along and no other abnormalities have showed up you baby is probably perfect.<br>  The cysts are really common and cause no problems- except for making moms worry for no reason.  Both my cousin's baby and mine are beautiful and have no health problems.  Enjoy your little baby and good luck with the rest of your pregnancy.|`|AA10315542	This happened to a friend of mine and her baby was fine, don't worry.
iP863XM6aa	Nope, it doesnt hurt. Obviously, not the most confortable thing, but no pain.<br>  They just make you lie back on a table with your feet held up by these feet holder thingys (dont know what its called :p) and then they  just insert this plasticky thing in your vagina to open up entry (its smaller than a penis so it should not hurt at all) and then they just take this large looking Q-tip and go inside and swab. Thats it :) (just like a pap test if youve had one done)<br>  Then they call you if the results are bad.

AA10247494	You should not have cramping with implantation. The most that people feel is a slightly pinching feeling that doesn't last very long. <br>  <br>  The most likely possibility is that you are just having a change in cycle and your period is starting early. <br>  <br>  If you don't get any more blood or very little and the cramps continue or if you start bleeding bright red blood and the cramps get very strong (more than normal) then you may be having a misscarriage. <br>  <br>  If the bleeding and cramps stop and you don't have your period next week you may be pregnant. <br>  <br>  The only way to know for sure is to see your doctor or if the pain increases go to the ER.<br>  <br>  EDIT - Seriously I've had 4 miscarriages. If you start soaking more than one tampon/pad an hour or your cramps get crazy extreme GO TO THE ER!|`|Dypm4U6eaa	Calm down hun...if you notice brown blood this morning and you are not suppose to start until next thursday you are spotting. There is a definite possibility that you may be pregnant. There is also a definite possibility that your body could be resisting to pregnancy which means that if there is a chance that you could be pregnant but for some reason your body is fighting it off could explain why you are cramping. I suggest that you wait another couple of days and see what happens because if you continue to cramp then you may have miss the pregnancy but if you continue to spot you need to take a test.=)|`|axBjKTJLaa	I just had the same thing this past week ---- brown blood barely noticeable --- and a lot of cramping that was very odd at six days before period. I just took a pregnancy test and it is positive. it may be implantation bleeding that you are experiencing. I had mine 6 days prior to my period---- so it was very odd. My period is due on Sunday, but not according to a digital pregnancy test--- <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|GmqyCkpjaa	what is implantation?
rBPi6N2daa	at 27 weeks my baby was 2 lb 12 oz, and they say she feels normal size, im 35 weeks now.  BUT IM JEALOUS! i want mine out, and you might have yours before mine!! im due april 1st. i am guessing my baby is around 6 lbs now.|`|VHHis05Naa	I'd get ready just in case, due to your history.  I have no idea how big she'll be, but you can ask your doctor for their best estimate.|`|qfNK5aDEaa	You should be ready by now..Have yours and the babys clothes packed cause since your other 3 children came out early it is more than likely that the same will happen this time..|`|2B2fgmw9aa	If you have a history of going ealry, then plan to go again...Better to be safe than sorry!|`|c0a5c8943ce6f1d0df1e342f2f780150aa	Nah- wait until the very last second.|`|URvhlHmeaa	4 girls? how sweet|`|46PSDx1raa	If you know that there is a chance that she may came early than you should definitely have things ready by the end of March just in case. I'm not sure if she will definitely came early but if that's how your other three children have come than it is more likely that she will follow in their footsteps.

I have been going out of my mind waiting. I take short walks during the day, relax and take nice long baths, watch movies, take naps, and just rest while waiting for her. I'm trying to enjoy the last days of quiet and not running around like a chicken with it's head cut off. Sometimes I get really anxious and can't sit still, so I go into her nursery and rearrange things, set out her first outfits, arrange her closet in order of size, color, and season. Then I wash and refold clothes, blankets, and sheets. That way I feel like I'm somewhat preparing for her to come. I guess it's my way of mentally preparing and hopefully telling my body "ok, I'm ready now, let her out".|`|r1KS5GsDaa	i knew when i was going to have daughter cus i was going to be induced..i found ut on a wednesday that the following tuesay was going to be the day. those 6 days were the longest 6 days of my life. or so i thought. i was in the hospital for 38 hours before meeting my daughter. i just slept the time i waited. or shopped. there was really nothing lse i had to do.<br>  good luck and the time will pass quick enough.|`|w9xx0SPaaa	I am 28 weeks pregnant and have been on strict bedrest since i was 5 weeks pregnant!!! oh my days go by extremly slow with my boyfriend being an accountant and its his busy time of year and he works 15 hour days!!! and i still have awhile to go but congrats on your baby hope everything goes great for you and the little one!!!|`|XVljoYZ5aa	That would be hard! My sister-in-law had the same antzy feeling. She got a 3D ultrasound so she could see it. Early in pregnancy you have so much to look forward to, hearing the heartbeat, feeling the baby move, finding out the sex, but near the end you just wanna meet him/her! Good luck!
a402885910549caddf0eb474b891f438aa	Very low. Most miscarriages happen about between 8-10 wks or before|`|96HWpdkFaa	After 12 weeks the risk goes down dramatically. =)|`|cj7sSPZEaa	There is always a chance that something could happen at any point during the pregnancy for any woman, but the chances drop drastically after week 12.  Don't stress yourself out about it.  You have no history and you are into your 13th week.   You are doing great!  Relax and worry about other things- like where you can go at midnight for ice cream.  If you have any bleeding, cramping more than usual or any other questions at all, then call your doctor.  They can ease your mind.|`|AA11920812	Your out of the woods. At 12 weeks your risks go down considerably. Then, down to almost nothing when you hear the baby`s heartbeat.<br>  <br>  Congratulations!!|`|wLBsgNKAaa	At 13 weeks, you are "out of the woods" as they say.  You have a 97% chance of carrying to full term now.  Best wishes!|`|75c742d5acd622a0bb5f444e18bb5853aa	1% or less.|`|nQyJFOMZaa	After your first trimester (0-12weeks) The chances of miscarriage drop almost to nothing. There is still a slim chance (like1-100000000) but you are fine. Most people feel comfortable after the 1st trimester is over and start telling family and friends about their pregnancy because the risk of miscarriage is gone.|`|OMbXazFFaa	It depends on a lot of things. Miscarriage occurs due to a chromosomal error in the egg or sperm. Between 10 and 70% of all pregnancies end in miscarriage. The main factor affecting miscarriage is age. The older you are the more likely you'll experience one. It's simply due to the female body and the egg's ability to properly implant itself and survive. Other outside factors include excessive smoking and drinking alcohol. But basically it's up to your body and Mother Nature unfortunately. Good luck!!|`|MvMT8TD3aa	They say when you get to 12 weeks you have gone past the "worst". Try to enjoy your pregnancy. Good Luck xox
cj7sSPZEaa	About 12 years ago.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	about 1997
AcxMUPdsaa	I work in a very busy office as well (all social workers).  The office is predominately women, so you know they have that instinct.  I have a private cubicle and would silently throw up in the small garbage (it works).  If you have a small garbage, I suggest that you bring some alcohol (kills the smell).  I eventually had to say something because the first trimester is full of all kinds of dr's appointments.  You can try to be honest and let your superiors know the deal so you won't feel tooembarrassed.  I hope this helps a little.  Eventually you won't be embarrassed because it's going to be second nature to throw up, wipe your mouth, and keep it going ( not to be so graphic).  Good Luck and don't worry it won't last too long ( I used to hate when people said it to me but it's true, 16 weeks prego and finally able to eat this week).|`|01vMpHkWaa	i threw up on the public train a few times<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EMBARRASSING! lol i dont know what to tell you though sorry..just wanted to let you know i know how it feels to be embarrassed when they dont know its because your pregnant|`|ntdGOZqGaa	I felt like this, its better to get it out bc if not you will just make it worse. Plus no one is going to be in there long if you are puking your guts out, more then likely they will just come back once your done. just tell them that you have some type of stomach bud. hope this helps
AA11100890	I think you are referring to chorion cysts.  DON"T WORRY.  MY baby and my cousin's had them too.  I also wasn't told about them right away.  They waited 3 more weeks until my next appointment to tell me my ultrasound was abnormal.  The thing they don't tell you about the cysts, and should, is that if they appear early on, they almost always disappear by 28 weeks.  Only if they don't disappear, or are accompanied by heart defects or other major physical problems do they indicate Trisomy 18- which is the horrible genetic syndrome you are referring to.  <br>  What I want to know is- if they almost always disappear, why do the doctors not tell us this- why do they let us worry?  When I first researched them I found an article by an OB/GYN "Chorion Cysts- How to terrify a mother to be".  He was saying the same thing.  Anything growing on our babies brain is going to panic us.  <br>  If the cysts resolved and both ultrasounds showed no other problems your baby is perfectly fine.  <br>  Believe me, I freaked out too, especially after reading about trisomy 18, but after my second ultrasound when everything was fine I relaxed.  Now my 1 month old is napping and he's perfect.  <br>  Have a great rest of you pregnancy and enjoy your little one.|`|VHHis05Naa	I'd consider changing care providers.  That is one serious mistake to make.  <br>  <br>  All of my hope and warmest wishes that your baby is ok.|`|96HWpdkFaa	Maybe you should switch doctors.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	that's really odd. my DR told me at one of my first visits about the quad screen and with you having the issue with the ultrasound i am shocked that your DR didn't recommend you go for on right away. i would ask your dR why and let him know that you are concerned about the issue now. you should let him know how you feel and if you are really unsure about this DR now maybe you can find someone else to see.|`|vygYFdsSaa	Gosh I can imagine your frustration. I'd go to a different doctor (perhaps a specialist) ASAP and see if they can give you a 2nd opinion and possibly test your baby. I'm so sorry and I hope you don't worry too much.|`|yKS2UI87aa	Yeah, I'd be mad too. But if the Dr. who did the ultrasound said your baby was fine then breathe a sigh of relief; afterall a healthy baby is what we all want. I would tell the Dr. who never said anything about your disappointment with their office.|`|lwlZMhiqaa	I'd definitley get a second opinion from another doctor.  See if there are any fetal specialists in your area you can see.  You cannot stress for the next 18 weeks it's not good for you or your little girl.
POs5TeUDaa	when the doc stick the needle in for the first try i guess it was too close to the baby so he pulled it out right away, that one i felt a little pinch. then the second try, my god, felt like he stabbed me with the needle. what was the worse when they started to suck the fluid out, i started sweating lol. <br>  <br>  that was by far the most painful experience ever in my life. now im horrified knowing that giving birth would be x100 more the pain..<br>  <br>  oh and i was hospitalized that night and the day after because i thought was leading fluid (it was actually excess discharge, soo embarrassing) and i had a couple contractions when the nurses were checking me out.
AA11920812	I just got my first scan (dating scan) on Wednesday. Basically it was just to check for any problems or abnormalities. This way no one is suprised at 20 weeks to find out you have twins or there is a problem. Also, it rules out ectopic pregnancy and it is one of the biggest causes of death while a woman is pregnant.<br>  <br>  Also, he took measurements to make sure my due date was correct. I do ovulate early and I did gain an extra three days - which fits my ovulation day perfectly. Still, its so exciting to see my little blob and her (or his) little heart beating. *heavy sigh*<br>  <br>  It`ll be great! If your like me, have a tissue ready, lol.|`|UaL28atDaa	This will explain everything that's going on at this point in your pregnancy.

The lady doing the scan measured the baby, showed me the picture and I saw the heartbeat on the screen...um I got two pictures and I left. my next scan will be at 12 weeks. I am now 9 weeks. =) I'm excited.<br>  CONGRATS AND GOOD LUCK!|`|AA11510511	Yes .  They will take a couple of measurements on your 12 week scan. From this, they can tell how far gone you are.  It will be your 20 weeks scan, that they will go more in depth with measuring more things, and look for any abnormalites.  The 20 week scan could also sex the baby.|`|MR9iBgafaa	UK:<br>  <br>  It's fairly quick - about 10 mins. You can tell it's a baby and you should get a picture, though at my hospital you had to pay ￡4.  The baby's around 2 inches long but looks like a little baby on the pic.  They can't tell you the sex though but will show you the beating heart. <br>  <br>  In a way it's a better pic than the 20 week scan as the whole body fits onto the 1 picture, rather than just showing the waist upwards.<br>  <br>  Good luck - you'll absolutely love it!|`|46PSDx1raa	They don't usually ask you anything during the ultrasound/scan but you're doctor will ask you questions after wards just to see how you are feeling and he/she will also talk about the ultrasound with you. You can indeed see that it's a baby but you won't be able to see fingers/toes or a facial profile until the next ultrasound.|`|mqNxYMuUaa	on your first scan they see how far gone you are to the exect day such as 12 wks 3days. you can usually see its nose and stuff at this stage if you get a good picture. good luck xx dont worry about it, just make sure you drink  the pint/s of water before you go so they can get a good picture of baby x x they just tend to ask general questions but you will defo have all the answers x|`|suPTA1eNaa	At 12 weeks it will look like a baby, i had mine really early arond 5 weeks and it looked like a blob!  Think its called a dating scan because the make sure that the due date is right for babys size.  Good luck|`|VHHis05Naa	Yes, you can tell it's a baby at 12 weeks.  My dating scans have all been between 6-8 weeks, so it might be a bit different for you.  I did have a growth scan at 13.5 weeks and that was an external u/s, so it's likely that you'd have an external by then.  You just lay down while they measure the baby and determine your due date by those measurements.  They don't ask questions, really, but just tell you what they are doing.  Here is your baby's heart, head, etc.  They take some pictures and usually give you some as well.  Try to get them to take a full length profile shot so you can check for gender using Nub Theory.  <br>  <br>  Enjoy it, and congrats!  :)|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	Go here to see examples of what the US will look like:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pregnancy.about.com/od/fetus/a/12ultrasound.htm" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancy.about.com/od/fetus/a/12...</a><br>  <br>  They will ask you when your last menstrual period started- that's pretty much it. They'll do some measurements and usually tell you right there what your due date is based on your measurements. That's it!
HTKSoWLTaa	In the perfect world, a woman will ovulate for 24 hours, and sperm will live inside the uterus for 3 days. However, everyone's body varies. And the fact of the matter is a woman's uterus does not like foriegn objects inside it's walls, and it has a natural sperm-acide, which makes it harder for them to live. Out of the billions of sperm that is created in one ejactulation, only about a quarter of them will actually live past 5 minutes. <br>  The normal ovulation time is 10 days after the start of your period, which would put you at Feb. 28th to be your ovulation date. So, there is a good chance that this month will be your month!!<br>  That myth about only having sex every other day if you want to get pregnant is not true. Having sex every day will increase your chances on getting pregnant.<br>  Also, those ovulation testers really do work. They will let you know the day you are ovulating. <br>  <br>  I wish you all the best, and the one advise I can give is don't stress. Your body will react to the stress as a sign that a baby can not be born in a world with lots of stress, and it will make it 10 times harder to get pregnant.|`|HocTLdleaa	Sound like you are playing Russian roulette. I have a 28 day cycle and got pregnant around the 20th day.  I always thought I ovulated around the 14th day but you cannot predict the exact time you will. <br>  If you are not planning to start a family right now, maybe you should look in to getting the morning after pill from your pharmacy since you did just have sex today.  Then go talk to your doctor about birth control.|`|nQyJFOMZaa	Sperm can actually live inside you for 5 days. Your chances of becoming pregnant is the same as any month.|`|S1YGHrRzaa	One word: CONDOM!<br>  Remember?! It has no side effects as opposed to THE PILL...<br>  Make him wear his night cap... It'll be better for him AND you.<br>  So once again... what was the word?!|`|a402885910549caddf0eb474b891f438aa	Very possible. Got get the plan-B pill if you dont want to be.
1G3XPiq3aa	It would be very, very, very unlikely she's pregnant. Sperm doesn't live long outside of the body. If she really wants to waste the money on a test, wait until a week after her next period is due, and then take it first thing in the morning when the pregnancy hormone is at it's highest level. Any earlier and it's likely to give a negative result anyway.|`|AI2VoFP4aa	its not likely, sperm can only live outside the body for a few hours. she can take a first response ten days before a missed period but like i said i highly doubt that he had live sperm on his hand.|`|MvMT8TD3aa	Unless he actually ejaculated inside your friend i dont think she will be pregnant. Best time to do a test is before your period. xox|`|7pYyXSBUaa	lol! <br>  Omg! She isn't and can't be pregnant!
vygYFdsSaa	It is so unlikely its hardly even worth asking|`|UU1YR1Kaaa	zero, and if you have to ask that question like someone said before, then you do not need to have sex.|`|SMXuQF9oaa	there is like a 1/100 chance you are, but  the only safe way to make sure that you are not pregnant is to not have sex.|`|anm4YpZzaa	have u seen the size of my *****
rdpZrBc9aa	Some tests work before your period.  The box will tell you.  However, the sooner you test, the more likely you are to get a false negative if in fact you are pregnant.  Wait as long as you can stand it, and be sure to use your first morning urine.|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	You can take a test now. First response early result are great tests and they show lines anywhere from 9 to 12 days past ovulation. Tons of babydust sent your way!!!!
3Oiwh3Ivaa	You probably ovulated late! I'm assuming your period is irregular. I wouldn't worry to much since it's so early. When you go to the Dr. again you should at least be able to see a gestational sac.  It will be alright try not to worry to much. God Bless You and Your Unborn Child!|`|44ccf078ecbbb80711e26204438034abaa	Well ectopic read low on the HCG test... So aren't detectable as easily as normal old uterus pregnancies. But of course eventually they will start showing up on pregnancy tests. <br>  <br>  But with that said beings you didn't test positive till feb 25 I'd say you O'd late more than likely... and even though your period was that late you still aren't that far along. Not far enough to see anything yet on an ultrasound. <br>  <br>  If I was you I'd be somewhat concerned and would insist that my OB further explore it. I would suggest HCG tests every other day to see if you are doubling properly and see if your HCG is in the normal range. Then of course when they think you are far along to see the gestational sac on a ultrasound I'd get one!<br>  <br>  Also if you ever start feeling shoulder pain... then I'd call my doctor. Plus severe, and I do mean severe, pain on one side or the other then eventually it will usually migrate across your entire reproductive area. Or extreme sudden onset bleeding... RUN do not walk to the ER and tell them your suspicions. Might save your tube or even your life. <br>  <br>  But with all that caution put forth they are rare and unless you have one of the risk factors for Ectopics (Pelvic inflamatory disease, STDs, endometriosis and some others)  it shouldn't be much of a concern. Plus I believe you said you were 10 weeks... well if that the case most Ectopics rupture by 8 weeks. Yours would have more than likely already shown it's ugly face if you had one. Just keep an eye on it. It's MUCH more likely you just ovulated late. <br>  <br>  Oh and best of luck to you!

ApyrV5J9aa	There is still a possibility that you are pregnant but if so it would be WAY too soon for pregnancy symptoms since technically it is too soon for the fertilized egg to have implanted in the uterus, hence you are not pregnant, YET. That takes at least a week after ovulation for implantation to occur and at that point your body would begin producing pregnancy hormones and you would experience symptoms. Like I said, you could have gotten pregnant this month but technically it is too soon for you to actually be pregnant. The symptoms you suggest also can indicate an upcoming period, even if its not your norm. Wait until your period should start and take a test to be sure.|`|6ndM8fNLaa	You could possibly be pregnant. Take a pregnancy test to get that question cleared up.|`|gYkQc8Lraa	you might be pregnant|`|xy5UNiELaa	You could've conceived; however, I don't believe you would have symptoms this early.  Is AF close?  You may have PMS symptoms.  Pregnancy symptoms tend to mimic those of PMS.  Take a test about 14 days after you had sex (that may have led to conception).  Hope you get the answer you want!

clNss9sEaa	I don't think it really matters what you put the baby in, they don't care yet.  I used to dress my 1st girl in cute little pink and purple dresses and people still said what a cute little boy you have.  By the 2nd girl I dressed her in everything and she always looked cute, either way you still need to correct people and tell them if you have a boy or a girl.  With my son we did his room in a sports theme, and he loves pretty girls, staring at them and talking to them, on the other hand when he is playing with his sisters he ends up in dresses and dress shoes.  He is still a normal healthy little boy.|`|03f100b7d34df8ee17796e093fefa637aa	We didn't find out what we are having for one of those main reasons.  When people find out what you are having all they want to buy you is pink or blue.  No neutral stuff.  We are due with our first baby on March 24th and we have all kinds of neutral things for the baby considering we don't know what we are having and we are happy with that.|`|7Ox0nYH7aa	its only important as a courtesy to the poor people who will be expected to admire the baby.unless their in pink or blue,i ALWAYS guess wrong-"oh,he's cute" to a girl baby,or "she's adorable" to a boy.i cant freakin tell!neither can any1 else except the parents and grandparents.and everyone seems very offended when i get the gender wrong!it would be even worse,tho,if i said "its so cute"now i just say"what a nice baby".honestly,if u promise not to get mad at well meaning people who get the gender wrong,go ahead and forget pink or blue.but if u know deep down u would be mad if someone says "what a bruiser!he'll be a football lineback someday!" to ur girl baby,then please,give us a clue!i suspect the pink/blue thing evolved out of just that-it provides an unambiguous clue to onlookers,giving them clues on how to react without fear of offending.(all babies look like winston churchill,anyway......)|`|NpSVEC2naa	i dress my daughter in pink so that people know she's a girl. "is it a girl or boy" is an awkward question for people to ask. i have blue things for her but every time she wears blue she looks weird, almost like a different baby. plus there's nothing wrong with having a little princess or prince.|`|yrF1q1mdaa	I don't think so. I hate Girls in Pink and everything pink so if I was having a girl I wanted to make everything green and let her wear whatever I thought was cute. Even though I'm having a boy I'm making everything bright blue, green, and orange.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	well my dughter ha a pink room with butterflies i cant imagine a boy having that...clothes anything but i will admit if shes wearing white or anything ill put a pink or lilac hat on her just so i dont get anycomments like aaaw hat a cute boy you have lol|`|UnvpnmEGaa	no, you can dress them however you want.|`|ioZeveazaa	No my baby girl has all sorts of colored clothes. She has pink and blue blankets. It doesn't affect their mentality like that. Good luck!|`|qayCggxMaa	It really doesn't matter to the baby.  The question is, how much will it matter to you.  When I had my daughter, we hadn't known ahead of time if we were having a girl or boy, so we bought everything in neutral colors (yellow, white, green, etc.) to begin with.  For some reason everyone always assumed she was a boy.  After a couple weeks it began to really get to me for some reason (beyond any logic to it - I admit that) and so I went out and bought her a bunch of pink and lavender stuff.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	I think the main reason is that small babies look the same - so by dressing in pink or blue you are showing their gender so people don't have to ask, 'girl or boy?'<br>  I usually try to look for different colours but still feminine for my 2 girls. When you have 2 of them, you get sick of pink!<br>  She does have a pair of thomas the tank engine knickers (or boy pants) and they're her absolute favourite though!|`|0iUxfCMcaa	no its really up to the parents what they want. i get neutral stuff but if i know its a girl or boy i like to get some things pink or blue :)|`|AA10458750	well who wants their little boy laying in a fairy princesses room? or their precious daughter with frogs on her blankets? ugh...it is important!|`|gYkQc8Lraa	no its not important. i dressed my girl in blue and she looked really cute
5RvTXdmUaa	Like laneymom said, try orange juice and laying down. You'll feel it soon enough, hang in there. <br>  <br>  Congrats!!|`|FplTPoAyaa	Try drinking some orange juice and lying down in your bed with your upper body propped up, or lying down in the bathtub.  The juice will get the baby moving.  Good luck !|`|Kz5Fb0mPaa	I am 20.5 weeks and have felt my baby move. There's nothing I can really do to MAKE it move. It just kind of does it on its own, lol!<br>  <br>  I was gonna ask you if you had your big ultrasound yet. If that is coming up soon, you should be able to SEE your baby move. When the u/s tech pressed down on my stomach to get measurements, this made the baby kick!<br>  <br>  You should feel it soon. Dont worry!|`|GHlYbDfJaa	I'm assuming you have already had an ultrasound since you are 5 months. I'm sure the baby is fine or else the doctor would have known from the ultrasound so I don't think there is anything to worry about. If you are not too big yet, try laying in the floor on your stomach for a couple of minutes. It will put slight pressure on your belly and my babies always moved this way.|`|VJs1jZJ1aa	I felt my baby at about 17 weeks. But i know a lot of women that dont feel the baby until later. Its usually because of the position of the placenta. When your baby gets bigger you will no doubt begin feeling movements. I know it sux waiting, but it will all be worth it when you feel that first kick.
44ccf078ecbbb80711e26204438034abaa	I like Fools Rush In with Selma Hayek and Matthew perry.<br>  <br>  I also love just LOVE baby mama with Tina Fey and Amy Poeller. <br>  <br>  Both of those are kinda off kilter looks at pregnancy. Both make me laugh and feel emotions. So they are great! I would highly recommend them. Plus Baby mama is kinda new so it's easy to find but Fools Rush In was a 90's flick so it's harder to find but it's usually cheap. I think I paid 5.99 at CDTRADEPOST.COM for it.<br>  <br>  If you want more suggestions email me. I work at a DVD store and know tons! LOL! I can tell you dramas.. even action! LOL!|`|ed45267264b8e14db51a0d554e40d2a3aa	Waitress, nine months, & Juno - they all are good movies! and congrats on ur preg!|`|soFpywFcaa	turn on TLC and DHC They are showing baby stuff right now like brithday and bring home baby im watching right now|`|7zMtmKJaaa	knocked up!<br>  I loooooove to watch that movies.

Fh4B88ZGaa	No. Having a child is a responsibility. If you're not ready for the responsibility, don't have children.|`|NH2Yg2x3aa	mostly it depends on the situation and i know a lot of single mom's who choose to be. I have two step-sons we are supporting and i'm personally a huge advocate of father involvement and hold low respect for women who for no reason would choose to leave the child somewhere instead of with the father or his family or her family. Women shouldn't just get to be single mothers,and find a new daddy. bc his biological dad will always be his real dad no matter what. Women play victims too much.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	No.<br>  <br>  Women are perfectly capable of earning a great living to support a family.  I find it sexist to imply only women would need this help bringing up a child.|`|uuHPneEcaa	..I will be a single parent. my baby's father left me because he didn't like the name i wanted to name our son. I don't think that is fair. Alot of women out here are single and raising babies on their own.. I don't plan on sending my child to day care or anything like that for that matter. i don't really get any assistant from the state. I do everything on my own. I work and do what I have to do to take care of my son. <br>  <br>  I didn't go out much before I was pregnant. and I don't plan on do much after I have my son.. I am ready for my responsibility. once i found out i was pregnant i was prepaired to do everything alone. I go all my appointments alone. i have brought alot of things on my own.. (except for the tings i got at my baby shower) so I am ready BRING IT ON WORLD.<br>  <br>  i have to be a single parent I don't want to be with someone that doens't want to be with me and my child. his father won't even go get a job (so that is why i have prepared myself to do everything alone) I am not going to depend on child support either. if he does thats great every penny will to the baby. in a special account that i will have set up for him.<br>  <br>  people are speaking from experience u know. it happens.|`|AA10458750	I know a lot of women get into situations where they end up parenting the child themselves...but I don't think everythign you're talking about is in any state's budget. They have programs such as WIC, Medicaid & food stamps to help struggling parents, as well as earned income tax credits & $1000 child tax credits. If the mom can't make ends meet with all that help, then she should close her legs.|`|veO1RXrCaa	I agree it depends on the situation.|`|AA11004428	im not sure if this is going to come out right. i think if the dad was a contributing member of society before he dropped out of the picture, then yes. like if he was accidentally killed maybe in a car accident or in the line of duty. if the girl just got pregnant from a guy, doesnt keep in touch with him because of choice then no. why should we have to pay for someone else's f* up?|`|3K7ffKn2aa	women ar allowed to give birth with a father already. i happens all the time. i don't quite understand what you mean by the second part. but from what i understand no. why is it the states fault that someone is a single parent?|`|zBz10IiOaa	depends i guess on the situation i would never choose it to be that way though|`|POs5TeUDaa	that would be wonderful..
5rqVTOzmaa	Depending on your income you probably qualify for medicaid from your department of health and human resources. You need to go to your local office and apply. If you are approved, they will cover all of your prenatal appts, ultrasounds, the birth, etc. They cover up until your postpartum check up.|`|57389f506490a5ebd9798a3a388fb6f5aa	I hate to say this but turn to the government for help. Thats what they are there for and you shouldnt be ashamed to ask for help in your situation. You will do great. Go to your local job center and get an application!|`|8ENRWmoMaa	you can become a welfare mom, obama has made that easier then ever.  join the legion of leechers off the system.  Or move back in with your parents, most parents are pretty cool.|`|D8x0w6FMaa	Get the state medical card. That is what I have. I will probably only qualify for it for another year since I will be graduating and working full-time.|`|7fPuUT3Daa	Medicaid? Or just look into your states help. Your going to get rude awnsers on here im sure lol best luck|`|M1yfrNgDaa	keep your legs closed from the beginning and then you wouldnt be in this situation|`|JnLoHaoAaa	If you are a single parent and student then you would most likely qualify for Medicaid. Go to your local health clinic or job and family services to learn more and apply|`|e3fa2fb97cbca43e2c3086607351d4caaa	your state should have a medical card.....call your Department of Human and health resource...i think thats whats its called. See if you qualify for that. it goes by your income
cj7sSPZEaa	No this never happened to me, but my water did break early and the doctor did tell me that it is possible for it to repair itself.  And to the first poster- yes, if you are full term in your pregnancy they will want to deliver you within 24 hours of ruptured membranes, but if you are early, then they will not induce you when your water breaks unless you DO get an infection.  They will put you on bed rest for as long as possible.   It happened to me on two occasions where my water broke early and I was in the hospital for a week one time and two weeks a second time before they induced me.<br>  <br>  Here- I found this. <br>  "the amniotic membranes are kind of like Saran Wrap, and as the fluid is released, the amniotic sac sometimes doubles over on itself around the tear, and the membranes effectively re-seal the leak. "|`|01vMpHkWaa	no when your water breaks...baby must come out within 24 hours or they risk infection..the bag of waters can not regenerate<br>  <br>  EDIT: why did i get a thumbs down? that is a fact...not my opinion|`|tquqyozfaa	diego is right if your waters have broken and you have not delivered the baby within 24-48 hrs the doctors will bring labour on due to the higher factor of infection.<br>  <br>  i had very little water left with my first but he was 10days late they induced me, on my 2nd one who is now a month old they took me in early because when i had my 38wk scan they could find very little water and they induced me straight away but that was also because the baby was measuring small with me he was a healthy 5lb 8oz born. My best advice would be to speak to your midwife and get checked out <br>  <br>  Good luck xx|`|gIvau2Fzaa	What do you exactly mean by healed again??? If your water broke you have to go to the hospital! Even if it's leaking, still you have to see a doctor.|`|xrfpL6AIaa	What do you mean like BROKE with a big gush of water? Or a tear with a trickle of water because if its a tear it can heal!
fc3045470b792b9f04d696b7f2f9cd91aa	You should take the dosage indicated.  If it says two, you should be taking two.  Split them up, one in the morning and one in the evening with meals if you can.  Taking them on an empty stomach could nauseate you quite a bit.<br>  <br>  I get nauseated taking regular multivitamins if I don't take it with food and I'm not pregnant!|`|57389f506490a5ebd9798a3a388fb6f5aa	With my first pregnancy I had horrible hausea when I took the prenatal vitamins. My midwife said to take two flinstone vitamins and it would have the same vitamins in it as taking one prenatal vitamin and its so gentle on the belly. Also ask the doctor defanitely, Mabe her doctor recomended a differant dosage? good luck!!!
eDmdkUO3aa	Hard to get up, frequent urination ( even more than usual ), lots of pressure on lower abdomen, baby dropped and head down, loosing the mucus plug, cramps, dilation, effacement|`|MR9iBgafaa	Hi there, and congrats.<br>  <br>  I have a 4.5 month old, and had her at 42 weeks. I had to be induced as she didn't engage her head and did not want to come out. I felt perfect at 42 weeks - I was still walking 2 miles to my antenatal appointments. No pains, no aches, just the usual kicks.<br>  <br>  I was waiting for the head to engage - I tried the birthing ball from 40 weeks but no good. Tried curries, long walks, plenty of sex and raspberry leaf tea. She didn't come!<br>  <br>  Sorry I can't tell you what labour's like before you go to hospital, but the contractions are like period pains X 1000.  And CoCodamol and CoHydramol didn't help at all. So I think you'll know. Obviously I knew as I was induced though it took 3 days!!<br>  <br>  Anyway the longer you go, the bigger and healthier the baby generally. Good luck.<br>  <br>  XXX|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Sick at both ends.

It will look like a greenish/yellowish blob, and may have blood in it...
75c742d5acd622a0bb5f444e18bb5853aa	Babybeats.com. You can actually rent them for about $25 a month instead of buying one. They're about $499 to buy.

Fh4B88ZGaa	Take a test, and start using birth control. Pull out is a method of getting pregnant, not preventing pregnancy.|`|i8Ch743Laa	The sore breasts and nausea are the symptoms of you guessed it,pregnancy. Wait until you should start again,and take a test. None of us can tell you if you're pregnant. Another thing-the pull out method,it's just a way to get pregnant and say it was an "accident". The pull out method,it doesn't help to not get pregnant.|`|eU5Eth2aaa	It's never to late to take a pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  The pull out method is NOT a form of protection!  You can become pregnant from the precum.|`|DRb4Qlypaa	Pull Out Method= Just as good a chance as not pulling out!<br>  This was an immature question, keep from having sex until you know how it works!<br>  You will have to wait until period time to find out if you are going to be a mommy.|`|AA11296044	Pulling out is just as effective a method of birth control as prayer.<br>  <br>  If you are not pregnant now, you will be soon unless you start using some protection.|`|6L9jJnchaa	The pull out "method" is not a method.  People get pregnant that way all the time.|`|XX0ac9iRaa	It's never too late to get a test... and if you have never used protection then there is a definite high chance that you are pregnant (without using protection your chances of conceiving are something like 90%, higher if you are a teenager). The pull out method rarely ever works, as there is already semen on the penis anyway. I recommend getting a test as soon as possible so you have the highest amount of options of how to deal with your pregnancy.|`|HocTLdleaa	Yes, you can get pregnant as well as STD’s with the pull out method. You may be feeling nausea from PMS symptoms, stress or you might be pregnant. If you are pregnant, its not likely you would have any symptoms so soon though. Stress can cause the body to do crazy things even delay your period.<br>  <br>  If you have not missed your period yet, wait to take the pregnancy test until after you miss your period. You might get a false negative if you take it too soon and the tests are expensive.  If you have not started you period in at least 30 days and cannot afford a pregnancy test go to your local Planned Parenthood. They can test you for STD’s and pregnancy. Good Luck and use protection not matter what your boyfriend says. If he respects you he will do the right thing. Birthcontrol pills and Condoms cost less than raising a child. Most of the time you can get them free from Planned Parenthood.|`|jXeUCI6Vaa	no it's definitely not too late to get a test.  if you aren't using a form of contraception and are using no protection .. then i would definitely get a preggers test.  sounds to me like you are pregnant .. just by the sore breasts and nausea.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Yes you could be pregnant. <br>  The only way to know is to wait and see if your next period is late.|`|4ew4ogH8aa	its not too late to get a test.

bR4BgFLlaa	Who's dad? The rapists? Why would she care? Anyway, an adult that can be trusted needs to be approached about this very serious matter. Either way, or indeed even if she's making the whole thing up, she needs help.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Well there is not really anything you can do in this situation except convince her to tell her parents and tell the truth.  Are you saying that she is telling you that the guy who raped her's dad will lose his job?  Why would the father lose his job?  He didn't have anything to do with it.  There is no way for you to tell if she is lying or not, but why would she lie to her best friend?  She will sort this out on her own.  You just need to let her deal with this however she is going to deal best.  If she is telling the truth then she needs to tell the police, and if she is lying then she can get someone into a lot of trouble.  She will regret lying.  These things always come back to bite you.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	Clearly, she was not raped.<br>  Do whatever you can to convince her to be truthful.<br>  <br>  I can't tell you what to do, but if it were me - she would have to become honest or lose a friend.<br>  <br>  Hard choice, I know but itis not unlike "tough love".<br>  If she will lie about this to those who care and can help, she will lie to everyone - about anything that is unpleasant.|`|epgMbc4Vaa	yes, I don't think she got raped.She most likely is embarrassed of admitting she has sex.Let her parents take care of it because shes going to find out eventually|`|2PfMa1XIaa	SOUNDS LIKE SHE MAY BE LYING and sorry about THE CAPITAL LETTERS MY LLIL BROTHER WHO IS 2 IS SCREWING AROUND WITH THE KEYS.|`|gYkQc8Lraa	sounds like she may be lying|`|TmG11cB7aa	wow sounds difficult to answer but if i were in your position i would have to say that if she were ashamed about having sex with a boy then i would just pay along with her lie/possible truth because i do that with y friends to make them a little less ashamed because then she wouldn't have to be the one in the spotlight for having sex at age 13 lol just try to play along but she actually could have gotten raped ha good luck playing long|`|7x666vUCaa	if she really did get raped she would be scared from it and not really tell anyone about because it would have been to hard, so i think shes lying if she came out and told you straight away that she got raped. also if shes changing her story then she is not telling the truth at all.
PRg9UgOlaa	No, but that is actually a funny question. No offense. You did not mention if you are male or female, not that it matters because the answer is still no.|`|AA12370001	No.  time to go back to sex ed class!|`|cj7sSPZEaa	No it definitely doesn't.|`|zBz10IiOaa	no dear it will not|`|AdeD0xMuaa	No.|`|gYkQc8Lraa	no, not at all
23YPEAqBaa	I craved bean burritos with extra onion and hot sauce.  A&W Rootbeer, too.  No pickles, no doughnuts.|`|TmG11cB7aa	do not get worried if you are craving strange things when you are pregnant you crave akward thing. my mother when she was pregnant the first time had been craving salt and olives that were green. the second time she craved taco bell the restruant and the third time she craved candy and sugar lots of it! the fourth time she had totally craving a donut for the entire time so do not be weirded out with these cravings they are natural they happen to every woman thats pregnant|`|4aYNKp2Xaa	I'm gestational diabetic, so I crave anything that I'm told is "forbidden" for me to eat.  Donuts fall into that forbidden category.  Pickles are acceptable so of course I have no craving for them whatsoever!  *sigh*|`|xy5UNiELaa	When I'm not pregnant I like pickles and donuts.  During this pregnancy, I've had a HUGE craving for donuts.  But only Krispy Kreme Glazed.  No others will do :)|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	Both, I hate pickles too... But love me some donuts.. I had to take it easy with the donuts, not the best healthy choice for your little cinnabun in the oven|`|7pYyXSBUaa	No pickles or donuts..just Chocolate eclairs and <br>  spicy food!|`|yV337gGyaa	only donuts|`|SJ9lOnCOaa	Ew no!!! i have NEVER liked pickles or donuts and I don't think I ever will!|`|ioZeveazaa	I like pickles...not donuts. I like spicy foods alot!! lol|`|NPmRmnG6aa	I craved pickles during my first trimester and now that I am in my third trimester I am craving donuts.|`|AA10458750	EWW no! Cravings are caused by a nutrition imbalance. Switch vitamins and see if that doesn't help.|`|0iUxfCMcaa	yup :) lol with all 5 of my pregnancies i craved both lol i have two boys and am having my 2nd daughter in may.|`|gYkQc8Lraa	yes, totally|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	lol,not together,but they are good!
1Si9RlEXaa	I had my baby on her due date and like you it never changed in my pregnancy. She came at 2:56 pm. I went into labor at about 1 am on her due date. The doctors keep asking when my due date was, I keep telling them it's today! She came on her own also. <br>  Her name is Katelyn and she was born 8/21/08 weighing 6 lbs 6oz and 19 1/2 inches long.|`|JT4OSUPeaa	Awww your back!!!! Congratulations!!! I looove the name you picked out, oh and to answer your question, slim to none is all I know. Colten was due on September 5th and I had him the 2nd by induction, sometimes I wonder if I would have went past due or what. <br>  <br>  Colten was born without pain meds and wooo that was an experience I tell ya. I think I 'may' opt for pain meds next time.|`|SjX72fPyaa	Pretty rare I think. I'm not sure on numbers. But my daughter was 9 days late, my sisters and I were all early. My youngest sister was 1.5 months early, as was my boyfriend. I actually don't think I know anyone who, as far as I know, was born on their due date lol.|`|Yql4JTKPaa	my daughter did i was shocked my son no he was born 2 weeks early|`|AA11456232	Praise the Lord on your new baby girl. I love her name. I am so happy for you and your family! I have known a few women who had their babies right on their due dates. Sometimes it really happens lol . Not for me though with my Sons. One was  one month early and one one month late almost.|`|44c922fa010a9d18c4e3ddee46e3edd7aa	Wow! No pain meds or epidural?? Ouch!.....I think that IS rare...I haven't met anyone yet who has delivered naturally on their expected due date. My first was born 4 days after the due date and my second was delivered 6 days before.....it's so unpredictable. <br>  <br>  Congratulations!|`|28QPS6V9aa	about 1/28th of a chance. I kinda just pulled  that outta the air but I figured people usually give birth sometime between two weeks before to two weeks after their due date which is 28 days, so 1 outta 28. ???? Sounds good to me. :) Congrats on your baby!|`|BEa18qIzaa	Well I am pregnant with my fourth daughter and was due 2 days ago. My first I was overdue 4 days, my second I was over due 1 day, and my third I was overdue 3 days. So its never happened for me.|`|lWUknox6aa	don't know the odds but it doesn't happen very often.<br>  <br>  congrats on Miss Liddy!  From what I can see she looks adroable!!!!!|`|YJNql5Mgaa	I've heard it's between 2 and 5 percent.|`|TJ4q7X8Vaa	i've heard only 2 or 3%|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	I think like 5% or something like that!<br>  <br>  <br>  Im so glad to hear you and the baby are doing well!<br>  <br>  What did you name her?<br>  <br>  ETA: Awe that's a pretty name. Congrats!|`|AA10822361	I don't know the statistics but all three of my children were born on their actual due date naturally :0)  <br>  Congratulations on your bundle of joy!
AA11065140	My daughter is 23 now, but when she was younger, my rule was that she and her friends should not swear in my presence.  The concept behind it is that they should (at least pretend to) have respect for me as an adult, and should act accordingly.  I also expected my daughter to behave similarly with her friends' parents.<br>  <br>  While I wasn't around, I didn't care, since I wasn't there to hear it.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	I swear very rarely with my parents, but its usually all jokes.  =]|`|GygOv3dIaa	my mom lets me|`|8yTP3jO8aa	It's not like I would be able to force a teenager to not swear.<br>  <br>  But, I would have taught my teenager why swearing is bad (that it makes people feel bad, that it's disrespectful etc), and I would uphold those standards in my home.  I certainly wouldn't be able to make him not swear with his friends, but I can teach him the correct principles and let him choose for himself how he applies them.|`|rSWX0CZ7aa	Well, I just never swear, so it's never even been an issue with my parents.  They've never told me I could swear and they've never told me not to swear.  They never cursed around me as a kid so I never picked up the habit, and even when I went to middle school and everyone seemed to start cussing, I didn't do it because I hadn't been raised to think it was a normal thing to do.  So we've really never even talked about it! lol.  If they ever heard me swear they'd probably just be shocked! lol.  But they'd probably tell me not to use those words again.  But I never swear around my friends because they don't swear either.|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	I'm a teenager (18) and I don't swear around anyone. My mom wouldn't care because she swears once in a while (while speaking) and she's heard me swear once before and didn't care. <br>  <br>  I just prefer not to swear but it does slip out once in a while (when something happens that catches me off guard).|`|prqrQcd1aa	I don't have teenagers yet, but have a brother and sister that are 15, and 13... My mom allows them to swear..At my house they know better!|`|O0sbEqi5aa	well i swear but not at all with my<br>  parents around i would get in a lot <br>  of trouble,[get grounded] and when<br>  im with my friends and my parents <br>  are their i wouldn't swear it would<br>  just feel uncomfortable|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	uhm i do it but out of anger & if i am angry my aunt doesnt say anything but i am trying not to bc it makes me look bad & people are less respectful of u if u do & i will try to teach my kids that|`|pnL5WTXMaa	i tell him to use respectful language where ever he is - but i can't control what comes out of his mouth (when i'm not around). especially when he's with his friends.|`|xL6McXTfaa	My Parents don't care, I don't swear because I don't want to.|`|bdWO9wSAaa	I'm 14, and I can cuss whenever the hell I want.|`|KKGt03xlaa	***** no<br>  <br>  :)|`|kUCVLuTPaa	my mom lets me

Especially if you have been hurt.<br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|axwdwiSuaa	umm, well think about how unimportant some friend drama really is, and really I just don't care anymore. I  made new friends and found some ppl who weren't stupid.|`|08Ksc5Oiaa	Eight or nine.|`|8VvCEnDzaa	only time will tell i am going through the same thing|`|iuRzYFQ5aa	it defend on yourself! if you shattered from this problems you shattered if not then its not! okay!|`|DcHERujlaa	get new friends<br>  a new life|`|Osn1xpu6aa	well...technically you can't shatter....|`|ZX2so3twaa	awh, i know exactly how you feel.<br>  i hate feeling so numb.
TQW5E6olaa	I have a thumbs down faerie stalking me, does that count?|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	i would find it annoying personally. i've seen first hand what some trolls do to some users.  its quite bizarre actually.  mildly amusing at first but then the one got weird when it started talking about the users child.  not cool.  if they are just being a butt i say stay flattered but if they are truly obnoxious i would block them.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I'm not shure that i've gotten one yet...maybe one that gives me thumbs down...but no stalker trolls..not yet! lol<br>  <br>  I have to say one of the "lovely" people that answered your other question had a very "lovely" question of her own lol.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090227143030AAvh9a0">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|nVQGpvuoaa	I would get annoyed if I had a stalker. <br>  I feel like they have no lives if they have to do something so childish.|`|JeoETWJHaa	I like 90% of the users in this section. Some of the ones accused of being Trolls make me laugh.<br>  <br>  If you can't handle what people say to you, or want to call everyone a troll who you don't agree with, shut the computer down, and go do something else.<br>  <br>  You have to take the good with the bad. I am on my third account guess that makes me a troll in your little eyes.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	I have one from the dog section, and to be honest...it pisses me off.  That person posts ignorant, hateful comments, and at times encourages illegal activity...yet *I* keep getting reported.<br>  <br>  I always check my email first thing in the morning and it's very frustrating to find nasty emails and violation notices.  Grrrr.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	i dont have a troll that im aware of...i want a troll:( i feel left out LOL na if i did have one i wouldnt care i guess id be flattered they log on all for meee:))) haha|`|2IATHTXwaa	have you thought that maybe they are not stalker trolls but you spend too much time on YA! <br>  or maybe they are just tell you, you are and f-ed up B-word?|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Hmmm I don't have a stalker troll. Great. Now I feel unimportant. Thanks for the esteem boost, Bizzurke ;)|`|EcP4CqQHaa	Flattering|`|VuUz8NgKaa	Not flattering and it is very annoying.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	i find the cloning thing annoying.  go find your own person to be and don't pretend to be me.  beyond that, sometimes it fills a dull moment.  i think i actually get more annoyed at other people's stalkers than i do with mine.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	Now it's NOT.  I used to joke saying "Oh how flattering", but now I'm down right sick of this person (I'm pretty sure I know who they are) who is reporting my questions for ridiculous reasons.  She even threw insults at me in another question I answered.  People really need to get a life.<br>  <br>  I have to say, I'm getting rather sick to DEATH of them.
D6t6SoFRaa	Don't you think its the place of the parent to teach lessons to the children.  It is definitely not your place to make these choices.  Talk to your dad...its not our call either.|`|AA11452541	Thats kind of kiddyish. The purpose of the key is to get in the house when NO one is at home.   Its not your place to "teach" him a lesson.  His lesson will be learned when he really can't get in when no one is actually home.|`|OrX7hVeXaa	I would leave him to wait outside just like you did because it serves him right to have to wait for your dad to come home. This is a really good punishment and soon enough he will learn to bring the keys with him!<br>  <br>  I have learnt from future experience but when i got home there was nobody to let me in so i just had to wait until somebody got home and i waited for like an hour outside!<br>  <br>  GOODLUCK!!!!
AA11537580	she's married and in high school???<br>  where are her parents?<br>  she should file a police report and you should tell your parents what is going on..|`|cts6S8vRaa	If she is at the age of 16 she can get married with parental consent (if that helps) at the age of 18 she can get married without parental consent ( if that also helps) <br>  <br>  <br>  you should tell someone because beating your wife is illegal<br>  <br>  hope everything turns out well|`|rOfFOcwpaa	Not sure how long you can go with out them knowing, whats wrong with her parents?|`|t0sDyzrdaa	you cant hide her from your parents... they r gonna find out sooner or l8r. she should get a divorse

I'm part German too, but I'm a little bit on the tan side because of the sun.|`|KH9HROrSaa	by white you mean pale skin tone, correct?<br>  yes, stereotypically  Germans and people of Scandinavian decent have paler skin tones.|`|08Ksc5Oiaa	Slovaks are the most white.|`|AA11296427	They were supposed to be perfect.<br>  <br>  Blonde hair, white skin, and blue eyes. So... maybe?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|8ZUs3qxxaa	Perhaps. It's wacky, though, because it doesn't sound very logical, but maybe...<br>  I know a German family and everyone had blond hair. Most of them had blue and green eyes, but my friend has brown. Hm. Interesting.<br>  And aren't Scandinavians supposedly relatively paler?|`|oKZ3GstXaa	most are pale but some are darkerskined, i know 2 germans that have rather tanner skin (one looks mexican), but everyone in my family have pale skin. were german|`|0G7Ehzbuaa	I dont think Germans are. I think people from northern Europe (Sweden, Norway, etc) are the most white. Germany is in central Europe.|`|PmNIgABVaa	probably, yeah......im really pale so maybe im part german...hmm..

PmNIgABVaa	cool! i play soccer too! i no how you feel.. i get nervous too. but i no you dont want to hear this, but just have fun and dont worry. if i were a guy, i would be worried if a GIRL beat me with the ball. just be strong, agressive, confident, smart, and have fun! TRUST YOURSELF. play like no one is watching or like if your with ur friends during a practice. good luck!! :) p.s. dont be shy when playing and with the soccerball!|`|jHUAfrojaa	I'm a defender in soccer too! I just recently quit though due to personal problems that I had to take care of first. Anyways, honey don't worry. Just think that they are girls with no boobs. We play against our guys every year and we just have fun. It doesn't matter who wins or loses, all that matters is that you gave your all in the game and you had fun doing it.|`|9aIotOULaa	your friend had great advice<br>  <br>  basically just enjoy it and try your best but at the end of the day don't take yourself too seriously or you'll miss out on  a really fun experience|`|YWxMbmvRaa	words of wisdom come from the wise and children because they see things without limitations and those are words of wisdom. So your friend is right and wise because she still see's it as a game "unfettered" or "whatever". She looks at it as a chance to show how woman girls ladies are as good or could be better than the men boys gentleman, you say you have the same game stat's so why not embarrass them by being in the girls winning team and helping in what ever way you can by maybe kicking the perfect centre cross that allows your striker  to send home the winning goal and if its your friend she will know what you are going through and i feel will show you the worthiness of you on the field even though you may have been embarressed early on or after the winning goal was shot, and know this also I'm a man and I play to win and taught my daughter the same they are the Northland champs for last 5 years and could play nationals but her friends haven't got the same natrual skills that she has but are still good enough to be part of the champs for 5 years and also it shows how good the comp is when only 3 to 4 from her team make the nationals know also that should you win it was because you are better than them and i know i would never let anyone beat me without being better than me, girl boy mother father grandfather grandmother sister brother son daugther granddaugther (joke) because winning is everything and everthing is built in to a winning team YOU GO FOR IT AND I HOPE YOU WIN..... P.s my daughter was striker now she defence so it shows that you have to be good because you can't lose games on bad strikeing but bad defence or brillent attack so don't be embarrased by a better player because he will understand he needs a good play to put his skill to the test but thats what i think|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	Just go out and have fun. Who cares if you mess up. Think of it as a learning experience for the game you like.|`|FiUprYsvaa	I play soccer. <br>  I take it you are in high school so I am only at most 5 years older. <br>  <br>  I play on a co-ed team that is 18+. <br>  The skill level on my team is pretty even across the board but other teams players in the league, well, some shouldn't even play. <br>  But it is all for fun. <br>  <br>  I can defend like no other but I can't score to save my life. There are so many times I've gone to score and completely messed up. <br>  But at the end of the game no matter how many times I've messed up, I know my team loves me and wouldn't get rid of me for anything.
ZbnxGIsnaa	It depends on how emotionally stressed you are dear.  You would have to be incredibly stressed in order to have a miscarriage, but do be careful.  Think positive.  =)|`|GVPhFa3Raa	Yes It Can Happen Take Some Time Out To Relax.. Its An Important Time xx|`|98WKYtfwaa	Stress is one of the biggest causes of miscarriage hun, a little fight, cry or time of stressing out here and there is ok, but if it's constant and you're always feeling down there's a possibility.<br>  <br>  Take some time away from your husband for a while, try relaxing and when you get stressed out just count to ten and breathe. <br>  <br>  Me and my partner fought alot at the begining of my pregnancy, we took time apart and it was definitely alot better on me. I forgot about him and concentrated on me and keeping myself in good condition, i'm now 23weeks pregnant tomorrow.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	I have answered many questions like this, it is very common for pregnant women to worry that stress could possibly cause harm to their baby, just think of what stress does to you! However, there were many, many pregnant women that lost their husbands in the 9/11 tragedy, I watched a TV special on this on TLC a while ago, and none of the women that they had in the special had any adverse effects to the baby by the stress of losing their husbands and I am sure that was a hell of a lot more stress than any of us can imagine. So I truly believe that being stressed is not going to cause a miscarriage, but make sure you get enough rest, eat healthy and drink plenty of water as those help you and your baby stay healthy! Hope things get better for you!|`|5I01tsgYaa	I miscarried after I found out my sister had been killed.  The doctors would never confirm that the emotional shock is what caused me to miscarry, though.<br>  Here are some useful links I found.|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	You need to calm down and remember that during pregnancy we can be a little bit emotional and every little problem is magnified by 100!!!! Even if you do take some time out just think happy thoughts about the growing baby in your tummy. Everything will work out just give it time...Good luck.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Stress is not good for your body, so it is certainly not good while you are pregnant.  I believe it is possible to cause a miscarriage due to stress, however I am not 100% on that.  I think it would take a lot though, try to relax yourself as much as possible, take nice relaxing baths (not too hot of course) and do things that make you happy, try to laugh a lot and you should be okay.  Talk to your doctor about the issues going on so that they can advise you on how to handle it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, I hope things turn around for you soon:)|`|SQf0M6wBaa	There are some recent studies about a relationship between a stressful pregnancy and developmental issues with the child. So,yes,I believe there could be an increased risk of miscarriage.You are the one that is pregnant and your husband should go out of his way to help you.This not the time for a fifty/fifty relationship.|`|plI0WOrUaa	yes.  Stress is very negative to your pregnancy.  Especially so early on.  Even if you don't miscarry, the stress can lead to a baby who is high strung, can't settle also.  You are going thru alot, so do what you can to relax for you and baby.  Good luck!!|`|KQF5X9Vpaa	yes it is possible especially in the first few months...you need to be very careful|`|YiDhb60Paa	yep
7XBoIgd6aa	It's common to get your period WHILE you are breast feeding so obviously every one is different|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	OMG i went from Dec 2006 to May 2008 before i had a period! i was preg for 9 months then breast fed for a year (from Dec 2006 to Sept 2008).  so i actually started my period before i was done breast feeding, but it was sporadic for ever before it came back for good. so normal period....not till November or December of 2008.|`|XQ3jHM9aaa	It is different for everyone.  I breastfed my last 3 babies, and I started my periods about 8 wks after delivery with each of them.  I have friends that didn't get their periods for the entire year that they nursed.|`|HkDx9erWaa	It varies for every woman. It can take several months or even longer. It's also possible to get your period while beast feeding.|`|HocTLdleaa	I exclusively breastfed my son and I got my period at 8 weeks after delivery. I still breastfeed my 10month old and get my period every month. Some women have all the luck :) I guess everyone is different.|`|51jVOdq5aa	i only breastfed my baby for 3 mos and a couple of weeks after i started my birth control pills. A month after that i already got my period.|`|osXIbwmKaa	I haven't had one since June of 2007. I got pregnant and have been breastfeeding for almost a year and no period yet. I'm not complaining either! Just different for everyone.|`|caM1Syyfaa	In my case, 6+1/2 weeks after birth, despite exclusively breastfeeding.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I got mine like 3 months after I had the baby, you can still get your period while breastfeeding.|`|ArDBlPKYaa	I was almost exclusively breastfeeding my son at 8 months, and my period returned then, although very light.  He's still breastfeeding now at 14 months, and my period's becoming a little heavier each month, though still not up to pre-pregnancy.
uGinKU6Baa	Clearblue fertility monitor is really easy to use and gives you clear and reliable answers as to when you are not fertile-at your most fertile point of your monthly cycle|`|BG2BTDT3aa	You can use a OTC Ovulation test, they'll tell you when the 2 best days to try and concieve are
kziIf0r6aa	Lay a rug down on the grass with some books and her fav toys some food and drink for her to nibble on while she explores.  Just be mindful there arent any fish ponds or swimming pools close by she can get herself into trouble with.  She should be able to taste things that arent mean to be eaten a little dirt or worms wont hurt them every now and then, lets just say she wont eat it again.  Otherwise invest in a play pen make it fun for her to be in there...  Im sure with a litle persistance she will love going outside and the fresh air will do her good specially the vitamin d for her skin|`|AFi5kTiEaa	I found yard work with a toddler is near impossible.  I would do it while she is napping.  If she is walking, you can let her "help" you.  My kids were around 1.5 when they started getting interested in digging in the dirt, watering plants, and cutting the grass.  My son had a bubble lawn mower, he played with it every day for ever.  He used it for 3 years.  Keep her close to you and do simple things, like weed, water so you can keep an eye on her, she might even want to join in.  <br>  <br>  If there is a young girl in your neighborhood you could ask her if she wanted to babysit for an hour or two to keep her busy and play with her so you can get some stuff done.  A 7 or 8 year old would be great they usually love babies and it will make them feel grown up to watch a baby.  You will be there of corse to keep an eye on them both incase there is a problem.  You can pay her a small amount, like two or three dollars an hour.|`|AA11212578	Although she doesn't like it,  1 years olds need either a fenced-in play area or somebody watching them.    Sand boxes are pretty good at keeping them entertained, though.   Maybe put a sandbox inside the fenced in area.
tgUbWojPaa	They get to feel grown up!|`|nVQGpvuoaa	It feels like a "right" to sit up there.<br>  And they don't feel like a '"baby" anymore.|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	The front seat is only for adults and kids are always in the back seat (where they should be) so they want what they can't have. It makes them feel older too. They're also able to see a lot more in the front seat. <br>  <br>  I remember always wanting to sit in the front but I was the youngest of four and still have to sit in the back sometimes even though I'm 18! lol.|`|olcXIcsvaa	Well for me i dont like sitting in the back because i cant see anything from the back. I like to see where we are going to and i can turn the radio on.|`|tkkYIdIvaa	With me it was so my siblings couldn't. So I could Hold the MCdonalds food, So I could talk to mom, so I could see, so I could recline the chair.|`|LwbwMFX9aa	makes them feel like a big person
rOfFOcwpaa	I think you all should meet up and try to sort out your problems.|`|axwdwiSuaa	bella is reallly stupid, or just a b****|`|5DRCrwU2aa	It is definitely rude, and it also doesn't make sense to me why you weren't invited. If Sarah has a problem with your new friend, then I understand why she wouldn't invite her...but there is no reason to start leaving you out of the group. Unless this is one of those situations where Sarah started feeling left out when you slept over at your new friends house and attempted to get some sort of revenge on you by creating this drama. I hate when this happens and it's always over something silly. I think you should try to find out which of your friends is most sincere and trustworthy and trust your friendship into that one.
NPjF1t28aa	flirt back say something that would make sense. say something like oh really!? <br>  btw i think he's talkin about something totally different about what you guys are saying. think sexual.|`|57LFRfqCaa	It means he is going to spray you with the hose. Yes, he's flirting.|`|G9hsP45Haa	be like maybe or sumthin<br>  <br>  plz answer mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090227171423AAdrTwq">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|rOfFOcwpaa	I'd say "hahaha you're such a flirt"|`|Na1HDNncaa	just put "lol" <br>  <br>  lmao!<br>  its what evry1 puts when no1 knws what 2 say<br>  <br>  <br>  or if u want to b flirty put:<br>  <br>  "lol! cute"
kgE96Nhcaa	First of all the issue with infertility is being overweight.  You are not overweight!!  PCOS pts, many doctors have had success with Metformin and women have been able to conceive once their insulin is regulated.  That is only if you had an issue with insulin in the first place and with your weight I am only guessing you don't a simple blood test would determine if your insulin is normal.  Have you started on a prenatal vitamin? All physicians will recommend that while you are trying to conceive you take one a day which of course you would continue taking once you do conceive.  You can discuss options with your doctor, many times it is the PCOS that causes you infertility but sometimes it is just a symptom of the PCOS that is preventing you from getting a baby and once the symptom is treated you are able to conceive.|`|Od73sfkxaa	5'5'' and 118 pounds is not overweight.|`|RR35cmBdaa	it could be but maybe not. i have PCOS as well and every time i went to the doc there was nothing they could do as i was over weight. i am now 6 weeks pregnant after 4 years of trying
Z4hn3a5xaa	I believe it has something to do with pigments coming in then. :] Babies normally have their true eyes come in at about six-months.<br>  <br>  Purple eyes is a genetic mutation, I know that.. Are you sure it was purple? O_o<br>  Platinum blond hair normally changes to another colour, saldy. :c It's really pretty, too.|`|51jVOdq5aa	a babys feature changes all the time esp the eye and hair color which makes it more exciting to see all the changes. Wait another year or two to wait for more prominent features in your baby.|`|919a5083d4a4d4c8d636d308e38a0229aa	It's because Melanin production changes as the baby grows. Melanin is what makes the eyes and hair darker.  My pediatrician said she had a patient whose eyes changes color at 15!|`|X6as2nOAaa	I don't know why but it is kinda cool.|`|il9vgn2qaa	its because of environmental factors or something or other i was told (:
a162de189aa1c1becbdbb0cd4b7cd67caa	yes that would be cravings.  <br>  <br>  i really suggest staying away from the cigarette ash cravings tho, as well as the eating dirt craving and perhaps the kitty litter craving as well. XD  i've heard of many woman crave these things.  even tho its normal to crave such things, it just isn't healthy. for obvious reasons. <br>  <br>  anything else you safely eat whilst pregnant, you can eat tho.  pickles and ice cream is a common craving as well.  <br>  <br>  if it is making you sick i wouldn't suggest eating anymore of the pancake stuff.  your craving will subside and you will forget about it after a little while.  and it will let your tummy feel a bit better. :D<br>  <br>  and congrats on the pregnancy :D :D :D :D|`|kyqhMuSiaa	Weird cravings aren't uncommon this early. My sister in law craved the smell of washing powder and used to carry a jar of it around with her. A friend of mine used to eat chalk during her pregnancy. It's the bodys way of saying something is missing.|`|AA10280194	When you crave non-food items (cigarette shavings would certainly fall into this category!) its called PICA.  You should let your doctor about it because it could indicate some deficiency they need to be aware of.  As far as the food cravings, I guess whatever floats your boat :-)  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!|`|mbNWBem6aa	It's normal to have cravings, your body's taking care of the baby, but I encourage you to stop eating that pancake mix. Eat only the things you know are good for you.|`|dvK45AVNaa	I think they call it PICA.. if you have a craving for food that's inedible.<br>  <br>  I've been craving pancakes every time someone says something about it. >_> Pancakes and salad. Lots of Salad.|`|XpLufXKFaa	I heard about craving weird things like cigarette ashes. It could mean that there is something essential lacking from your diet, such as iron. Check it out with your doctor.<br>  <br>  Also, get ahold of yourself, put the pancake mix down!|`|vV9qPn16aa	lol i know what u mean about the pancake mix! i had the same craving.i even craved licking soap.just make sure the pancake mix doesnt have raw eggs in it that dangerous|`|AA11542929	talk to ur doctor.. they dont suggest that type things.. its not normal.|`|CdbwPzWmaa	Weird cravings like eating charcoal and ash are actually very normal - just don't eat it. It's amazing what combinations you can imagine and really enjoy - even foods that you don't normally like. Try some of these combinations and enjoy them in moderation. I find pregnancy a great time to really enjoy food.|`|jQmHlXaZaa	wow. everyone pregnant like to eat so it probaly is a craving. but the cigarette thing is kinda creepy!|`|X6as2nOAaa	Yes that is a craving and you need to stop eating it. That would not be good for you.|`|XhIYAH6Laa	riiiiight...well this sounds gross...lol|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	There is a name for what you have but i can't pronounce it. You need to tell your Dr as this force of craving could make you eat something that is really harmful to you or your baby. Please see someone this is a serious problem.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I've heard of women wanting to eat the cigarette dust before! So I guess it's not as weird as I thought. <br>  <br>  My mother in law ate ice cream with pickles, pineapple, and chocolate sauce all together when she was pregnant with my husband.|`|xy5UNiELaa	Pretty weird, but normal.  I've heard of ladies craving cigarette ashes...|`|be5076c0b98b495ffe00aade08f96b65aa	Well the cigarettes thing, is not normal. It does happen though. Some women even crave dirt, sand, paint, soap...etc. This is some kind of disorder that you actually take meds for. They say it's due to a vitamin deficiency, and that your body will crave weird things to try to make up for it, even if it has nothing to do with the vitamin your low on.<br>  <br>  The other cravings are just pregnancy cravings, and completely normal. I mean it's not going to hurt the baby to eat pancake mix, providing your not using raw eggs. Also pickles and ice cream is a very common craving. I haven't had it...thank god...but alot of women do. If this stuff is making you sick, although it's good, you should stop eating it. It may be too heavy for you right now. A good way to stop eating it, is to think about what it will taste like coming up. Lol...sorry but it worked for me with weird cravings!
ZdAVk5Qxaa	Stress can be a big factor in this situation.  you mentioned about her having a lot of stress last month, that can leave you with out a period or just make you very late. If blood test haven't picked up a pregnancy by now, i would just go with the idea of stress being the big factor, but if she continues to miss her period i would get things checked out.  I moved in with my boyfriend at the end of december and i didn't get my period till i was like 10 days late due to the stress from things, just give it time and things will all unfold.|`|vdXnvJwMaa	If the blood test came back negative then she is not pregnant.  Stress will cause you to miss a period sometimes.  Also if nutrition isn't good then that can be a part of it.
NHIQl6VTaa	Chloe elise sounds a little odd<br>  <br>  but bella rose is pretty :-)|`|DZJsQFGAaa	OK, i didn't think you were naming her bella after twilight<br>  Chloe Elise is nice<br>  I also like Chloe Rose<br>  I like Bella, but I think it's like a nickname|`|34VXCyvVaa	Bella Rose is nice (although Rose is becoming dreadfully common as a middle name), but I don't care for Chloe.|`|ocwIcfzPaa	I have no idea what Twilight is so I can answer without bias!<br>  <br>  I love Bella Rose! But Chloe Elise is also grand (if not more common) <br>  <br>  I would go with Bella Rose.|`|P9k8qHP6aa	I dont like Elise so I would have to pick Bella Rose|`|4Bj5ki79aa	i like bella rose more<br>  i have never liked the name chloe|`|ZRbTdQ6iaa	i like bella rose better than chloe elise|`|epLfYG7Kaa	I don't really like either of them. <br>  Chloe Elise - Its okay. I don't care for Chloe, but Elise is pretty. Maybe you could do Charlotte Elise instead, or Lindsey Elise<br>  <br>  Bella Rose -  Sounds too nicknamey. I think you should do Isabella Rose and use Bella as a nickname. Or Arabella Rose. Either way, I think Rose goes great.|`|61NKzPzMaa	Chloe Elise is a beautiful name.<br>  <br>  Bella is a nickname. Rose is beautiful.|`|NePgB9b2aa	Beautiful! Both lovely names. :)|`|1ad2771a77e03d1afa77d4cef9cdd54baa	Both are very beautiful names!|`|X4pFEbioaa	to be honest they sound like intercity girl names|`|bKBnHqkMaa	chloe|`|g9MXnOJDaa	so sweet!|`|bRz1dulCaa	I love Bella Rose! I have two boys but if I had a girl it was always going to be Annabella Rose, nickname Bella Rose. How beautiful is that? I am a Beauty and the Beast fan, which may be why the two go together so well for me. They are both pretty.|`|8fbe337e2b372d5b39e76d1d6d5f91edaa	i love the name bella also and i think bella rose is a beautiful name, im not much a fan of the name cloe.|`|4yhWdTjhaa	Love Bella Rose... beautiful and romantic!|`|f7W6R9G0aa	I like<br>  <br>  Elisa Chloe<br>  <br>  and <br>  <br>  Isabella Rose<br>  <br>  better|`|IN6weFmlaa	i like chloe elise but you could change it to Elise Rose so each family member wins.( if you like that name.)|`|CUlMgnnSaa	I LIKE THEM BOTH.. GTEAT NAME!
CEWIP3AHaa	Ok, bragging time. I have gorgeous olive green eyes. Last year, my vision got bad so I needed glasses. I was gonna buy a really cute blue pair of frames, but then I realized that blue would cover up my awesome eye colour, so I chose a GORGEOUS red pair,  by DKNY, that brings out little red flecks in my eyes, and makes them greener, and takes away the tiny yellow flecks in my eyes. So I wear my gorgeous glasses every day. Also, I use an amazing mascara (the green tube, by Maybelline NY. I can't remember the name!!) and when I wear eye liner, I have a really nice pale-ish gray that I use. You're supposed to match your eye colour to your shadow/liner colour to the opposite of your eye colour:<br>  If you have_____coloured eyes, you wear_______coloured liner/shadow. <br>  <br>  Blue -> Brown or Black<br>  Green -> Gray<br>  Hazel/Brown -> Blue<br>  Gray -> Green<br>  Black -> Green or Blue<br>  <br>  So yeah :)|`|drI1vsJdaa	I like my eyes and I have clear skin.<br>  <br>  I use black eyeliner, brown eyeliner, and dark purple eyeshadow (Not like a tramp.) <br>  <br>  And I use peach blush to compliment my skin tone :) <br>  <br>  I have brown eyes, and tannish skin. What do you do to flaunt your best asset? :)|`|K1kZlWY8aa	I have two best assets. My fiance and my daughter. I flaunt them both together -- fiance holding my hand, while we push my daughter in her stroller.|`|rOfFOcwpaa	Um, makeup, hair, nails, clothes, taking care of my skin, being a good person, expressing my opinions, and being a flirt.|`|CC6dSdJmaa	By being naked, but being scantily dressed in something attractive can be sexier!|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	under the bed covers|`|0G7Ehzbuaa	you dont|`|qH7IA1Staa	well i guess ya. I have big greenish brown eyes that i put this nice cacky  eye liner on and i put clear mascara (for school days) that i use a eye lash curler on.

U HAVE BLUE EYES!! i wish i have blue eye.....|`|lzivF4Idaa	i carry him around on my hip!|`|Osn1xpu6aa	i've got pretty eyes. that are really big.<br>  so i just use eyeliner and gold eyeshadow and they look prettier.<br>  <br>  and my hair is pretty. so i leave it down all the time.|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	Just show it off to its best advantage.

jG8b3Mz0aa	Me and you both have the same feeling. Now Friday's are like a "blah" to me. I remember the excitement I would feel when a Friday would approach, now it's just another day to me.|`|TQW5E6olaa	I still get excited, yay weekend time! We do movie night on Friday with popcorn, tonight is Flubber|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	i used to get excited about fridays too.  now i'm with you.  its just another day.  if i'm lucky enough that my hubby will be home on sat then i get a 50/50 shot of sleeping in and letting him take care of the kids.  usually i lose though|`|prqrQcd1aa	Buy a  40 and chug... lol i'm joking<br>  <br>  We do rent movies, have a family game night with the oldest child, make pop corn or have a pizza party or else some other kind of take out food... <br>  <br>  We are actually not doing anything this friday because my bf has to work early in the morning, I just got back from shopping and it's very quiet in my house! Wow, maybe i'll make my own pop corn and just sit back and watch the drama on here! LOL|`|wZAeBisbaa	I remember when Fridays were the high point of the week!  After kids, Friday became just the transition from one kind of job to a different one. Now our kids are mostly gone, but we're still in the habit of using weekends to catch up. Once in a while, though, we go out with friends or listen to live music, and we always end up asking ourselves why we don't do it more often.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I say. Ah Relax time.<br>  Cause my daughters father takes her on the weekends.|`|9N5KJKL2aa	I completely and totally agree. Same here. Just this week I lost track of what day it was completely. (I normally work full time and was just recently laid off. So now I stay home with my son).<br>  I mentioned to my husband in the past few weeks about TGIF that use to come on TV. That was a BIG deal...where did it go?<br>  I suppose its our duty to make Friday nights as fun for our kids as it was for us. It was all so much easier when we were younger lol|`|ysUg2Rgraa	Fridays, looking forward to the weekend...my 11 year old is having her birthday party, just got back from a 2 hour jonas brothers 3D movie. They're getting ready for cake, then some nintendo wii. My 9 year old is at Grandpas' for the night with my 9 month old.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Either I'm working or it's just another night that the Soup happens to be on. An exciting night for me now consists of going to Target to check out the dollar spot and eating at TGI Friday's. But hey, that's fine with me :)|`|LwbwMFX9aa	friday for me means hell yes I get to sleep in in the morning, hubby will deal with the kids,lol<br>  <br>  I am photographing my daughter tomorrow for her bday pics so I got lots to do tonight to prepare|`|E047GSKdaa	About the same as you.  We do occasionally go out as a couple (meaning once every 6 months).  But I am happy for this life.  I do not miss bars and parties at all.|`|FkYkt4Fbaa	I feel like i had 100 pounds on my chest all week and now it is off!|`|F71Q4lOkaa	i dont know... a day in the end of our weeks at night? lol nothing special... iusually sleep early|`|V5K66Xb4aa	i too am a SAHM, and i basically had to say to my family, "look we all are having different acivity for everyday of the week because if we dont i wont even need to differentiate between days anymore..." my toddlers looked at me like "moms crazy,... again" and my hubby whined because he knew he wouldnt be able to come home from work and beeline for the xbox in the basement and leave me with the kids alone for yet another full 24 hrs. <br>  So heres what I can up with:<br>  Sunday: coupon clipping and the Simpsons<br>  Monday: Disney themed anything (movie or reading stories and coloring) <br>  Tuesday: Moms night ( nice quiet bath, reading in bed no housework allowed)<br>  Wednesday:Pasta night<br>  Thursday: Mystery night (used to love csi in high school so now we read childrens mystery stories or play a mystery game)<br>  Friday: Dinner and Movie night ( at home or out)<br>  Saturday: is kids choice ( usually go diego go on the vcr, grrrrrr)<br>  so ya i am crazy but its better than not remembering the time and days things happened on..

TE7foNwMaa	I really love Rue... I love the name Ruelle, but it's a name that I would probably never use...unless as a middle name. <br>  <br>  As for MY names...<br>  <br>  Girls -- <br>  Melodie JoAnne -- I love this spelling of Melody...it's the french version, and it reminds me of my sister because of that. She's learning French and plans to visit it soon. Plus, she's taught me how to say lots of wonderful things in French like "the fish are surrounding the diver" and "look out for the kangaroos". It's amazing. JoAnne is my aunt's name. She actually used to live in France...only for a short time, though. <br>  <br>  Arden Christine -- I mostly just like Arden. Christine is after my cousin. <br>  <br>  Remi /or Remy Carys -- Remi/Remy (I can't decide which spelling I like better...what do you think?) is a name that I've always loved...even if it is the name of the rat in Ratatouille. That's almost a bonus to me... I do love that movie, and Ratatouille is also one of my favorite foods. Carys is a name that my mom's absolutely obsessed with, but my dad would never let her use it. So, I'm all for using it as a middle name for any of my future girls. I do love it. <br>  <br>  Melodie, Arden, and Remy (or Remi)<br>  <br>  <br>  Boys -- <br>  <br>  Callum Spencer -- Callum is after my Uncle Cal... Spencer is after some family friends with the last name Spencer.<br>  <br>  Keller Henry -- Keller is after a friend named Kelly. Henry is mostly just a name that I like. <br>  <br>  Lathan Archer -- Lathan is after my brother, Nathan, and Archer is mostly a name I love...with a slight hint of being after a puppy named Archie...is that horribly weird? I did love the dog, and I did love the name first, but, once again, it being after the dog is just kind of a bonus. <br>  <br>  Callum, Keller, and Lathan. <br>  <br>  I loved all of your boys' names. They're great, especially Grayson, Luke, Casper, and Lachlan. I also love Charlotte, Ariel, Scarlett, and Rory.

FUNhlpiqaa	Actually, I burned my stomach twice with my first baby.  My OBGYN said be careful for my own safety, but only prolonged exposure to high temperatures would harm the baby.|`|UxG6CkU2aa	Baby is very well protected in there, so she/he will be fine. I would find out what kind of ointments are safe to use while pregnant to avoid infection on the wound. I burned my leg really bad with scalding water at 12 weeks pregnant and they had me use bacitracin. I am sure everything will be okay.|`|plI0WOrUaa	i don't think it will hurt the baby, but did you get it checked out by your doctor to be sure??|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	NO, Baby is fine. You have nothing to worry about. <br>  Hope your ok!|`|wKpxocFjaa	You have no reason to worry, unless the burn becomes infected or your uterus starts to contract.

But let your doctor know at your next visit, just in case Better Safe Than Sorry!|`|MxxtlTN4aa	no i dont think it hurt the baby<br>  the womb is a very safe place so i really doubt the baby was hurt<br>  im sorry u got burned tho..<br>  =)|`|AA12074512	how the hell would people on internet know how bad you burned your self....call or go to the ER..dumb a**|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	No the baby is fine.

51jVOdq5aa	I got the Graco system as a baby shower gift and honestly it was really heavy(maybe bcoz its the regular one) but ive heard from a friend that strollers from evenflo (maybe not all) are really lightweight and affordable at the same time.|`|0b822c825c81fdba58631516562146c2aa	Graco car seat and a Snap and Go stroller is the way I went.  The travel systems tend to be really heavy.  The car seat pops right into the stroller, the stroller weighs like 8 pounds and takes seconds to open and close.  I am so glad I did this over a travel system!  AND it was much cheaper.  Like $100 for car seat and $50 for the snap and go.|`|xqp28ETVaa	I'm happy with the Graco combo I have for my little guy. It's lightweight enough for me to hold him with one arm and fold it up and toss it in the trunk with the other. What made us choose this one also was the fact that it was easier to "drive". It made tighter turns and was less bulky to get through the more narrow store isles. The car seat has been great too. no problems.<br>  <br>  Add- Ahhh...yes! Good point Sophie's Mommy  :) ! Mine is the Light as well. I don't know how the regular model is.|`|pj5bUjbQaa	I am also a fan of the graco snugride set... It retails between 159-249.00$ depending on patterns and such..<br>  <br>  Otherwise for about 275.00$ I would recommend the chicco keyfit set..<br>  it is the best rated for preemies but can still hold bigger babies no problem..<br>  <br>  <br>  p.s. the only down side to the snap and go system is that as soon as your baby is not happy in his carseat the snap and go is worthless. you have to buy an actual stroller than so the money you did save you end up spending on a stroller anyway.|`|JvM44Bx5aa	I would also recommend Graco.   There are several styles with light weight and easy to carry as required.  Please see below the following online stores for your further review:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/healthy-care-booster-seat-20" rel="nofollow">http://astore.amazon.com/healthy-care-bo...</a><br>  <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/graco-jogging-strollers-20" rel="nofollow">http://astore.amazon.com/graco-jogging-s...</a><br>  <br>  Hope you could find the interesting one!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i have the graco quattro tour deluxe; it's great, the seat goes up to 30lbs, has great foam padding, comfy; stroller is comfy ; lays back, sits up and some in the middle, big basket, easy one hand fold, drives great, cupholders for everybody, compartment for your keys or cell phone, baby snack tray, window to see through the shade, not that expensive, has good safety ratings...they come in  a million colors so you might have to look around until you find a color you like....i love mine, but they discontinued it a while back...|`|X6as2nOAaa	I like mine the best it isn't too expensive but works wonders and glides really easy. GRACO!|`|1SGl03Zlaa	The lightest stroller for an infant carseat is probably the Infant Carseat Frame <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2266236" rel="nofollow">http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...</a> , but it can only be used with the carseat and you would have to buy the carseat separate.  I have a Graco (a bulky one though) and I love the carseat.  I have heard that the Graco metro light stroller is really good.  The best thing to do is go to toys r us or babeis r us and try them out, they usually have all their models out on display so you can fold it up and see how you like it and see which one you find easiest to carry.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	I have an Evenflo Aura and I LOVE IT!! The stroller is fairly big though, it just fits into my mom's trunk when I use her car. Depending on what kind of car you have I would suggest testing out the size in your trunk before you buy. I have a minivan so it doesnt matter for me but if you have a small car  you'll have to be picky.|`|qqiVKUBpaa	None of the travel system strollers are lightweight but they are really nice to have. I have the Graco one in Deco and my daughter sleeps great in the Snugride carseat. I would recommend getting a second umbrella stroller too. They're very lightweight, fairly cheap to buy and are really nice to have when you aren't going somewhere that you're going to need the carseat carrier.|`|siDcjgJCaa	GRACO metro light travel system.. LOVE mine.. but make sure its METRO LIGHT.. they are generally 10lbs lighter than the normal ones.
nVQGpvuoaa	The father seems to have trouble letting anyone in his life other than the people he already has because of what happened to his maybe ex-wife and his son's mother. I'm sure he sees you as something that could be apart of their life he's just to afraid to admit it. I think it could have the son have trust issues..but thats the only thing I think on top of my head.|`|OTFZtGCaaa	Why are you spending that much time with his son if you clearly are not included in their future?  If you sincerely enjoy it and you’re doing it because this is most fulfilling for you, wonderful!  But if you think this will ‘get’ you his father, judging by your own words, it won’t happen!<br>  <br>  The way you describe your situation is not fair to you.  However, it seems the father is at least straight forward and honest enough to let you know where he stands.  While you seem very sweet with his son you’re either not the one for him or he might just have too many demons to deal with to recognize how lucky he should be to have you in his (and his kid’s) life.<br>  <br>  With all that aside … I want to know how your behavior might affect your well-being in the future.<br>  <br>  I think that if his father finds someone he falls for head over heels, this woman “will” be in “their future”.  And/or if his father keeps on ‘exiting’ relationships, I hope the son will not take him as a role model when he grows up.  I’m not a psychiatrist, but I believe that kids turn out differently given the same situation (at least the one you described) … while some might copy that pattern, others will not want to do so as they felt early on something was wrong.<br>  <br>  <br>  Two tips for you though:<br>  <br>  1.) If you’re really that concerned about his son’s future behavior, start putting a ‘visitation schedule’ in place now while you’re on good terms, so you still get to see the son (if)/when you break up.  Of course, it won’t hold up in court, but if his son continues wanting to see you after your possible break-up, he should let him if he has his son’s best interest in mind.<br>  <br>  2.) Take care of yourself!  Go out, enjoy yourself, see other people (I’m not saying become intimate with other people, or at least not right away … but if his father is at least a little bit into you – and he might only figure that out once you’re not available 24/7 anymore - this will work … whether he’ll admit it or not), and you can still attend to his son … but not 24/7 as he’s not your son – never has, most likely never will be unless you’re able to turn that situation around by YOU LIVING YOUR OWN LIFE and not his … and (hopefully) you might become someone he doesn’t want to miss in his (and his son’s) life – ever.<br>  <br>  All the best to you!

aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	Well, playing with toys, reading books, singing and the like are all very good for your daughter!  However, there are other things that are good for her too.<br>  <br>  Take her out to experience new sights, sounds and smells.  Visit the aquarium, zoo, park.  Libraries and/or book stores have story time for young babies.  We are in a much smaller community than Atlanta, and have a Children's museum complete with an infant area.<br>  <br>  At her young age, there are not a lot of classes she can participate in, but Gymboree is one of them.  Also, check out baby massage and sign language classes and other things offered for the younger ones.  It will be a great experience for both of you, as you will meet other moms as well.<br>  <br>  Also, check out <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com">http://groups.yahoo.com</a> and look for "Atlanta Moms" or "Atlanta Playgroup" and I am sure you will find a lot of groups of moms.  Ours got together weekly for the moms just as much for the children!<br>  <br>  I hope you both have fun!|`|JsqMSU9Haa	check your local park system or town - they usually have very reasonable mommy and me classes.  gymboree is good if the teacher is good - and it can get expensive, but well worth it to get out of the house if there are no other options.  see if you have a MOMS club in your area too - that'll help you get out and meet people in your same situation and give you some things to do.  check out the library too, they usually have storytime for little kids|`|CzKrqgmgaa	we do a Mother Goose class once a week and a drop in play place a few times a week.<br>  it has saved my life and mind countless times!!<br>  i strongly suggest getting out with your LO, not only for something else to do but some social interaction for both of you. it has made a world of difference in my son's anti-social behaviour and we have a lot of fun!|`|Q7lvSU03aa	try mops.org - you meet other Stay at home moms, and they offer free childcare.<br>  <br>  Another great site is mommyandme.com for playgroups in your area.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I am at home with my 10 month old daughter too, and it is a lot of work.  But don't worry, they grow so fast that soon she will be much more independent and you will have some of your life back!|`|2LmfQUbKaa	those things are good but what about other kida in the hood? set up some play date take her to the park swimming! i understand that is 4 sure! good luck!|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	my advice would be for you to get a part time or a full time job and get your baby into a daycare center.. i have spent the first 3 months after the delivery with my baby and i was at my wit's end.. so the daycare has been a life saver for me and it's worth every penny :).. i had to stay with my now-toddler a couple of times and i clearly realized that i am a lousy playmate - i mean i did not know the words to the apparently hottest song at the daycare (about the firetruck) and neither did i know the moves for that song.. yeah, a bummer.. my daughter just shook her head and went to play with the toys.. yeah.. so daycare it is :)..

Pregnant women are supposed to drink EXTRA water for the increasing blood supply and nourishment of your baby..<br>  <br>  The metallic taste could be an increase in iron from your prenatal vitamin..<br>  <br>  I've experienced both. :)|`|p0prrzf2aa	no it's not a weird symptoms. you need to drink lots of fluids as in water :)|`|VbdBxVLvaa	No, I had that when I was around six weeks but it went away.  Every time I would drink water, I would get that mettalic taste in my mouth, and I was super thirsty alot.  It was strange, but now you know you are not the only one :)|`|HocTLdleaa	I had the same taste in my mouth in the begining of my pregnancy. It was like I had ate a tin can or something. It went away after the 4th month.
bSjbVxO2aa	I had a sit down all day job during my pregnancy, too. I looked around the office and found a wooden box that was small enough to fit under my desk, and I rested my feet on that box. <br>  <br>  If you can't do that at work, be sure to do that at home. Put your feet up and relax. Trust me, the swelling will get worse the closer to your due date you get. Even more when the weather starts to heat up. <br>  <br>  On your breaks be sure to get up and walk around, getting circulation to your legs will help. Even if walking is that last thing you feel like doing. <br>  <br>  Watch what you eat the night before work. I remember once we had mac and cheese for dinner, and the next day, my hands and feet were so swollen. Didn't eat that again. <br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|ntdGOZqGaa	try drinking lots and lots of water, it will help flush extra water out of your body then elevate your feet when you can|`|TXddP0uxaa	Get yourself a little stool to sit under your desk.  Just having your feet elevated slightly will help quite a bit.   Also, drink more water, and put your feet up whenever you are at home.|`|HQoDN8Gzaa	It's  normal. Just don't walk on it  too much and rest.My aunt did the same|`|GVPhFa3Raa	I Had This After Work.. As I Had An Office Job All day.. I Had A Foot rest But It Didnt Work.. Wen I Got home I Would Put My Feet in Cold Water Then Lie On the Floor With My Feet Against The Wall In The Air.. lol<br>  xx|`|aaZ0cTdCaa	like everyone else said, drink water! <br>  <br>  Be sure to mention this to your doctor... swelling can be a sign of high blood pressure, which could potentially be dangerous..<br>  <br>  No worries, tho.. swelling is unfortunately common
JnLoHaoAaa	Since you gained not as much weight as a lot of women, if you decide to nurse than can burn a lot of calories, along with eating healthy and excersising, you could go back into your old clothes as soon as a couple weeks. I was in my pre-pregnancy clothes right away. For others it can take months or sometimes never. It all depends.|`|xq7S9H5Raa	It depends on your metabolism and whether or not you exercise|`|FUNhlpiqaa	It took me two weeks after my first and I was back in regular clothes.  But being comfortable in my regular clothes it took closer to six.  Now on my fourth... my maternity clothes are my regular clothes!|`|pjgMW6qaaa	I had my daughter at 38 weeks gained a total of 21 lbs.<br>  My bump was gone in a week because I used some cream to help it go down and I was back in my regular size 7 jeans in a week.|`|BkK6J4Rtaa	depends on you hon if you have a fast metabolism then it should be fairly quick something between 4-5 weeks at the least it just depends i hope this helped my 22 year old sister is 4'11 and having a baby boy in may :)
MvMT8TD3aa	WOW you are amazing!!! It is so lovely you want to help other people. I found it really hard to conceive and never conidered this as i didnt know who would do it. I really hope you find somewhere as you would make so many people so happy. Good Luck with your baby xox|`|yZhwRZBqaa	I'm not sure if being a surrogate is legal in the UK in general (as with the USA, it depends on which state you are in).  I know it's "illegal" in Canada.  If so, you'd have to do some logistcal manuevering for the birth.<br>  You can either become a surrogate through an agency, or pair up directly with the Intended Parents.<br>  I would recommend that you go to www.allaboutsurrogacy.com and post your question there.  It's a great site for information and support.  And it's free :).  I like that!|`|JjBwydymaa	Ive never head of it being illegal in the UK. I maybe wrong though...<br>  <br>  But what an amzing thing to do.. I wish all the best! xxx|`|Ri2I8Ofuaa	hey =) i just wana say how amazing that is you want to help someone who is unable to have children of their own........ and if it is illegal it shouldnt be. =) xxx
Cx5Zo7IIaa	It is a simple question that shouldn't be blown up at. And Jude this is the appropriate section of yahoo answers for the question. It says pregnancy, it doesn't make the stipulation of whether or not you want to keep the pregnancy to term! She's not being insensitive with her question you're just being overly sensitive whether it's because you're trying to conceive or because of morals I don't know. Anyway <3, this website should help you figure out the answer to your question  <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/issues-action/abortion/state-abortion-restrictions-19943.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.plannedparenthood.org/issues-...</a>|`|X6as2nOAaa	No and you make me sick sorry but I don't think you should even be able to ask that on here.|`|H2IhRXIIaa	Yes you can. I think you can get it up to 3 months..I think. Google it..<br>  <br>  AND RUDE PEOPLE! SHE DIDNT SAY SHE WAS GOING TO GET ONE, SHE WAS ASKING A SIMPLE QUESTION..MY GOD..DNT GO KILL URSELF OVER IT. DAMN|`|tivpa7Vlaa	getting one has nothing to do with the size of your stomach it has to do with how many week along you are. u have to look up the law of your state/town on the legality of abortions cause its different. i know here in nyc unfortunately you can legally have an abortion up to 20wks. poor baby|`|cf5961a316debfb7203fffd630bd740caa	legally the limit is 24 weeks, but most doctors and clinics will not perform an abortion beyond 12-14 weeks. most women start showing at 15-18 weeks gestation.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I don't think you can get one when your stomach becomes noticeable. I think you can only get one in your first trimester 1-12 weeks pregnant. And they baby is still small at that point.|`|gxGsqNPPaa	Now that that immoral socialist Obama is president, abortion is [or will be] legal all the way up to partial birth, meaning that the baby will be mostly out of the women's body-everything except the head- and then murdered. <br>  <br>  Some states are fighting that though, so it may not be like that everywhere for long.<br>  <br>  I'm glad you're not asking because you want one. Abortions are sad :(|`|mbNWBem6aa	Maybe you should have thought about this sooner. <br>  <br>  Don't worry, there are plenty of sterile couples that would love to nuture and take care of that baby of yours. I would think about that now. <br>  Find some parents.|`|WPI0Z47saa	It varies depending on where you live. Where I live you can up to 24 weeks so yes you would be showing. Some allow it all the way until the end.|`|mjd1EtDWaa	the latest you can legally preform murder?<br>  <br>  not sure|`|dn2UCOkqaa	CLOSE YOUR LEGS! I DON'T THINK THIS CHILD ASKED TO BE CONCIEVED DID IT! SO HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF YOU WERE RIPPED FROM THE WOMB!?|`|kV9YT6bSaa	Own up to your mistake. Don't kill the baby because you had bad choices.|`|aMlWMkO5aa	In most states its 3 months in new york i think it's 4-5|`|FUNhlpiqaa	I hope you know how insensitive this question sounds.  Get a life... don't take one.|`|ixJB9jZnaa	Yes.  You can get an abortion when your stomach becomes noticeable.  However, I would think that if someone was going to have one they would want to have one before its noticeable.<br>  <br>  I found that in Ohio you can get an abortion up to 24 weeks! (That is 6 months!)  I personally think that is wrong, but that is the law.  <br>  <br>  In Georgia, they offer them until 26 weeks!<br>  <br>  "the Guttmacher Institute estimated the number of abortions in the U.S. past 24 weeks to be 0.08%, or approximately 1,032 per year."|`|z6IekuwSaa	In some places you can get an abortion all the way up until the baby is being born, as long as the head is still in the vagina when the baby is murdered. Just look up Obama and partial birth abortion<br>  <br>  <br>  I just want to say that planned parenthood is a joke. If you are anti choice when you disagree with abortion, then are you anti life if you agree with it.|`|bur1SgLSaa	8 weeks if you do the abortion pill and 12 weeks if you do the surgery.<br>  Abortion is a life changing thing. I was going to have one but decided not to and my son is almost 4 now and I couldn't imagine life without him. If this question is for you or for a friend of your tell them to really really think about it before they make a decision. There is also plan B, but that is only 72 hrs after unprotected sex.|`|3EiOobEVaa	Different states and cities have different laws on abortion. I know in Houston you can get it up until you are 5 months pregnant. But in other places it is longer or shorter. Check with planned parenthood or different clinics to see how far along they will do an abortion.|`|a6864b98763d4f13080c1e56782e7578aa	You should discuss this with a medical practitioner, they will be able to assist you and discuss with you your reasons and to see if termination is the best option for you.  <br>  Do not listen to peoples reaction to this question, we are all entitled to our opinions, however if you are geniune and require assistance, see your GP immediately!|`|POs5TeUDaa	yah this is the wrong section to be asking this question since everyone here is keeping the baby or TTY.<br>  <br>  but dont let people on here influence you. only you know whats best to do. the later you wait the more painful it is. here in CA the cut off line is 24 weeks without a medical reason. <br>  <br>  as for ur stomach, it could be bloated. i really dont know since u didn't give much info.|`|vuxZtfD3aa	Not after your first trimester. Abortion is not murder. In the first trimester, the life stages are of zygote and embryo. It is not yet a fetus and would not be able to sustain itself (by breathing, etc) outside of the mother's womb.|`|XpLufXKFaa	This is ridiculous. I really don't think you should be able to ask questions like this on here unless you are really looking for some harsh answers.<br>  <br>  There are other options, and you should do your research on them!|`|3eX2nxmCaa	Abortion is MURDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|p8HOUxNVaa	in the states where it's legal it's typically 3 months|`|uLuoDmcnaa	23 weeks|`|qCe9Pnlgaa	I believe it's 12 weeks.|`|eT2bIAyhaa	In the UK I think they wont do wen ur past 23 weeks.....
9LXXs93haa	Don't panic,first you have to check what sort of discharge are you having? Is it bloody,mucus like,thick or thin sort of discharge,does it smell?Is the cramp around your pelvic area or just abdominal cramp?When you were intimate with your bf did the actual penetration occur and did you use any contraceptives like condom?Those are the things you need to consider.If you had sex without using any contraceptives,delayed period,breasts getting bigger you might be pregnant so check it out and buy a pregkit to make sure you are.And,if not, then you have to see a doctor if you have any infection.|`|Od73sfkxaa	Very very unlikely.<br>  <br>  Periods can be delayed because of stress. If you are late for your period, test if it will make you feel better.<br>  <br>  Best of luck|`|SzNmGV0Daa	No, sweetie, unless you have had intercourse then you could not be pregnant. Don't be scared your going to be just fine. Good for you for not having intercourse, that's a very grown up decision. The day you decide it is right for you just make sure you don't get too wrapped up in the moment and forget a condom. Goodluck!|`|cec710393d00151b1d2083c09840602baa	You are not pregnant. Most likely you are just stressing to much and are actually causing your period to delay. Try to keep your mind off of this and your period will come. Dont stress.<br>  =]|`|192VzAFGaa	If you didn't have sex, you couldn't possibly be pregnant.|`|ZOA3VnRpaa	You should tell a parent or Dr. about this stuff
1thzSbS8aa	Fever is not a pregnancy symptom. You haven't mentioned anything that couldn't be explained by the fever. Not one definitive pregnancy symptom.<br>  <br>  I know it's hard to wait when you're trying to get pregnant, as you clearly are (otherwise you would have avoided that oh-so-flippant "Eggo Preggo" nonsense), but you'll just have to wait and see if your period is late. If it is, take a pregnancy test. That's the only way to know.|`|ij1b2Mvmaa	maybe you should take a pregnancy test?!?|`|aSuLnvoSaa	Noooo.......|`|m5Qh7gYraa	I don't know if your aware of this, but sex=babies and when its unprotected even more so. <br>  <br>  No glove no love.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	sad so so sad|`|AmqQ9it5aa	take a test??????????????????/<br>  <br>  how will we know..........and if u had unprotected sex there is always a chance.................DUHHHHHH|`|0unqJPehaa	What a total whore..<.<|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Its way too early to tell, you still have a week until your period is due, so you wouldn't feel much for symptoms now......your temp will be up after ovulation and until your period is due.  If your temp is high for 18 consecutive days after ovulation then pregnancy is a probility.  But its too early to tell, so you will have to wait until the 6th to test.<br>  <br>  Good Luck:)|`|NYJgiVxraa	omg. yeah sounds liek you are. lol 15 times and it only takes one sperm to make it to the egg. u have a high chance dude. get a test and show it to teh doctor as well or a take a few.|`|08Ksc5Oiaa	Jesus ******* Christ, 15 times?!<br>  <br>  Are you a ******* moron?<br>  <br>  Of course you're pregnant.|`|ULo8Cwdfaa	well of course theres a possibility everytime you have sex, especially 15 times. if you don't get your period, take a test.|`|Uo0b2aShaa	possibly|`|b3tEwY9vaa	yes.|`|rOfFOcwpaa	Ask a pregnancy test.|`|WY98tbNIaa	I'm not sure if you're a troll or not, but in case you're not. I highly doubt you're pregnant. I took a test about 1 month after I had sex, and it was positive. I felt a little sick, but had some major cravings. If you're concerned see a doctor or planned parenthood|`|yrue6Qjwaa	It's quite possible. Get a pregnancy test ASAP.|`|j0WkMrpJaa	probably not.
dFHsAXDMaa	as a nurse I will tell you the only issue you may have is the barium constipating the baby.... they are only going to give her a very little bit and them they follow it down as it travels down her system to stomach I have an 11 yr old who did this a few months back because he was complain about a heart burn like feeling. really a simple and commonly done procedure....<br>  <br>  I would buy a small container of prune juice and mix one part 2 ounce of prune juice to 2 ounces of water  and let her drink it a few times over the next day or so to help stop constipation. plus it will help clean barium out and baby love the taste of it.<br>  <br>  Not going to affect your future grandchildren no worries they will actually shield her pelvic area|`|AA10186411	This exam will not cause her to have any fertility issues.  Only massive doses of radiation will cause that.  She should be shielded anyway.  What they will do is fill a bottle with barium, and get your daughter to drink a little.  They will then lay her down and turn her from side to side while taking pictures using fluoroscopy.  They will have her drink during the pictures to watch her swallowing.  Make sure she gets alot of fluids (which isn't too tough in a newborn since thats all they eat lol) and constipation shouldn't be a problem.  My daughter pooped all of hers out in one BM later that day.  No worries.  I am an x-ray tech and used to do those daily, and plus my daughter had one at 4 weeks old as well.|`|2LmfQUbKaa	yes it causes gas so watch for that other then that we had no problems hope it all works out for you guys!
30BC5dBVaa	Sounds like you could be ovulating. Sometimes discharge turns weird during ovulation, thicker, etc. <br>  <br>  Yeast infections also come with thick white discharge. Especially if accompanied with burning/itching.<br>  <br>  If your period doesn't come on time then take a HPT. If the HPT is negative & you don't get your period, wait a week then take another HPT.|`|RR35cmBdaa	it could be anything try doing a test or see the doc|`|ZdAVk5Qxaa	Personal opinion but, you cant determine pregnancy by just discharge, it can happen for many reasons. Best way to tell is to take a test, if it is too early then wait a week or two then test. Hope that helps.|`|BG2BTDT3aa	possibly, but it could just be your horomones messing around before you have your period

But if you like Emma as the nickname, you could just make the first name Emma :)<br>  <br>  Kara Danielle - Also very pretty! I think it really suits all ages, too!!<br>  <br>  Overall, my faves are Emma Danielle and Kara Danielle :) They would both be gorgeous names for your daughter!<br>  <br>  If you would like some other names which go well with Danielle, here are some suggestions I came up with:<br>  <br>  Sophia Danielle<br>  Laura Danielle<br>  Olivia Danielle<br>  Annaleigh Danielle<br>  Ruby Danielle<br>  Kayleigh Danielle<br>  Piper Danielle<br>  Aubrey Danielle<br>  Michaela Danielle<br>  Zoe Danielle<br>  Alicia Danielle<br>  Larissa Danielle<br>  Layla Danielle<br>  Autumn Danielle<br>  Holly Danielle<br>  Jasmine Danielle<br>  Summer Danielle<br>  Kimberly Danielle<br>  Natasha Danielle<br>  Georgia Danielle<br>  Zara Danielle<br>  Kaya Danielle<br>  Hannah Danielle<br>  Amelia Danielle<br>  Chloe Danielle<br>  Charlotte Danielle<br>  Isabella Danielle<br>  Ava Danielle<br>  Jessica Danielle<br>  Sarah Danielle<br>  Mia Danielle<br>  Clara Danielle<br>  Lily Danielle<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!! :)|`|P9k8qHP6aa	I still like Emma Danielle or Madison Danielle|`|umca7pwoaa	I like all the names on your list except Kara (sorry).

uFrqC4Y2aa	I had dreams that I was having aboy and dreams that I was having a girl. <br>  <br>  As far as old wives tales, I was told that if your baby's heartbeat is over 150 it's a girl. I know it's not true 100% of the time but it was true for me. I'm having a girl 152 bpm.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	I dreamed both times that they were going to be boys, with my second pregnancy everyone told me oh its going to be a girl look at how high the heartbeat is I told them no you are wrong its a boy and sure enough it was.

And mine was one of them!! LOL|`|ZHJuK1QNaa	You said it, a dream is just a dream.  Thank goodness, because I had a dream that I had a dolphin!

I had a friend that I was hanging out with who had a boy so i kinda got attached. When I found out I was having a girl .. it was cool.. But before I found out.. I had dreams of having a boy.. so lol I believe i was dreaming for what i wanted. Now I am 11 weeks pregnant and I want another girl.. my man wants a boy. i dreamed i had a girl but i really think it will be a boy because, I want the opposite of what i get...lol But alot of women dream about the sex of there baby and it is right..

b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	I think one dollar is good. Maximum three dollars I would say. You could take her to a dollar store and let her pick out three things (and pay for the tax of course). <br>  <br>  How old is your daughter? She's probably going to be excited to get a couple dollars anyway. You could even get her dollar coins for something different.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	We do $5 for the first tooth, and $1 for each tooth after that though, depending on the circumstances, they have gotten as much as $10 for a tooth.  That was in the case of one that hung on for a LONG time.<br>  <br>  My daughter usually gets a little more because she polishes her teeth for the tooth fairy.  LOL|`|a8IRxC4raa	Congratulations!  That's a huge thing in the life of a child!<br>  <br>  We have a literary tooth fairy who leaves books.  One per tooth.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|prqrQcd1aa	A dollar a tooth! My kids love going to the dollar store! LOL|`|rt2V9gLUaa	For us it was usually a quarter a tooth.  Though I did get $2 when I lost a tooth while on vacation with grandparents.  <br>  <br>  I just asked my wife what she got.  She said it was fifty cents per tooth.  I'd stick with a dollar.  Sure there's not much to buy but she could always save up.  After she loses them all she'd have enough money for something nice I'd think.|`|TXddP0uxaa	I think a dollar a tooth is plenty.  She is a little kid.  Encourage her to save the dollar until she has more to buy something special rather than spend her money as fast as she gets it.  We always give the kids Sacajawea dollars to make them more special.|`|COecrPrMaa	I remember getting nickels when I was a kid, but times have surely changed!  I think that $1 would suffice.  If you want to add in a little change you could put a quarter and a few pennies to make her feel like she is really getting something :o)|`|mMBzpldbaa	lol, when i was a kid (and i'm 19 now) i got 50p for the first few teeth, and it gradually progressed to ￡1 then ￡1.50 then ￡2... the last ever one i got ￡5 because it was the very last one.|`|V5K66Xb4aa	geez i got a quarter for each of my teeth<br>  my parents really did hate me......<br>  but then again why do we even reward a natural part of growing up? wouldnt it make more sense to reward not having cavities or good manners?|`|bjNgMocPaa	I used to get $2 - $5. Depending on how old I was.<br>  But, I think once I got $10.<br>  And I was SUPPOSED to get $50 one time, (my mother was probably drunk when she told me),.. And I never got it.|`|tgUbWojPaa	$1 per tooth is fine. Going to the dollar store is fun :]|`|iAnJ8P3Uaa	Give her around $2 dollars, then as she loses more, progress.|`|gzaRhfAwaa	Wow, I guess I was ripped off by the tooth fairy!!<br>  I'm 28 and when I was little, I usually got 25-50 cents per tooth!|`|MqaCPXqZaa	Start off with 2 dollars,  then gradually add more on.|`|olcXIcsvaa	Haha well my mom used to give me 2 dollars but then 20 dollars when i got bigger. :)|`|9N5KJKL2aa	We gave my stepson $5 for his first tooth...|`|mIieRbUeaa	my kids got a dollar|`|EtCRnDJMaa	my 1st daughter for her 1st tooth I left $3 then my dad also went in and left her a bunch of change so she got more than $3, she got like $5 in change from him!  I was like DaaaaD!<br>  <br>  so I had to do the same thing for my 2nd daughter.|`|nVQGpvuoaa	Well since after the first tooth you start losing a lot i would keep it at 2$ and when she starts losing fewer shoot for 3-5 dollars.
SQf0M6wBaa	The heart rate is in a usual range of 120 to 160. When we tell you its 160,that is only an estimate.We count the heart rate for 6 seconds and multiply by 10.|`|51jVOdq5aa	babies normally have faster hearbeat compared to adults.

gfwQ5tFaaa	I'm so sorry to hear of your loss. I went through a miscarriage about a month ago and I know how hard it is going through all of this especially when you are reminded constantly of your loss. My bleeding stopped a week from the miscarriage. Take the the time to mourn for your loss, I know you already loved the child and had hopes and dreams for the baby as well. Rest assured that whether you are religious or not, your baby is safe in the hands of God.|`|DrIITL0Iaa	i am soo sorry for your loss. i had one before the same way you are and what kept me strong was knowing it was god's will.<br>  stay strong sweetheart. i know this is devastating.|`|Zg4zNGI8aa	they stop a month later and feel to start normal|`|VHHis05Naa	I'm so sorry for your loss.  :(  <br>  <br>  My miscarriage was like yours.  It was like a very heavy, crampy period that lasted about two weeks.  It got less heavy towards the end. Take Motrin for the physical pain, but the emotional pain may linger for a long time.  Time will help lessen the sting, but it may always hurt.  And you'll probably always wonder "what if".  I'm so sorry.|`|69e0c63175e4263a426aaac55f56e27faa	Sorry for your loss.. I have suffered that loss so know your pain.. Take ur time to rest and mourn... I personally dealt by not talking to people just comforting talk with close family... but everyone is different..<br>  god knows best and he does it what it's right to us even at times we don't agree to it, because it doesn't seem like it...<br>  Like what's best for me in this i lost my baby for god sake..<br>  anyways u will feel better, I hope u have seen a dr and will go for followup take lots of rest...<br>  in india they say 7 full term pregnancies are better than 1 miscarraige, what it means that 1 mc that's much for toll on mom body wise and emotionally...<br>  hope u feel better soon<br>  my bleeding stopped within 15 days...<br>  rest if possible
ntdGOZqGaa	You need to call and let them know that you are moving and give them your new address. sometimes it can take up to three- four weeks to get your card.|`|be5076c0b98b495ffe00aade08f96b65aa	It shouldn't affect the process at all, as long as you file a change of address card with your local post office. It may take a little longer for your card to arrive, however, because the card will be sent out to your address provided (the old one), the post office will catch it, or at least they should, and it will get readdressed at the post office and sent to you. In the meantime, it wouldn't hurt calling your medicaid provider and giving them your new address. You may be able to get ahold of them before they send the new card.|`|AA10280194	I didn't need my card for doctor's appointments, just my id number.  Call the person in charge of your application and ask them for your id number.  I just typed a paper on the computer that said:<br>  <br>  Medicaid ID # ______________<br>  Status:   In Process<br>  Re: Your Name & Address<br>  <br>  The doctor's office was fine with that for my appointment until my card arrived.<br>  <br>  You get a card every month for some reason so just let them know your new address and they will forward it accordingly.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!|`|C8E3fe3xaa	You could go to the Medicaid place and get them to give you a paper showing you are approved. You will most likely get it before a week though, i got mine 3 days after i was approved.|`|Yz2TvEMlaa	you'll most likely receive the card very soon. I was approved on feb 5th and got my card on the 8th. I called and made an appointment with a health care provider the day i was approved before i had my card and they were able to look up my name and see that i was covered. they just told me to bring my card if i got it before my appointment. make sure your worker has your new address and have your mail forwarded in case there is some problem and it takes more than a week to get to you.|`|NMzlbWt8aa	You need to call your caseworker to give them your new address.  You should be receiving your card soon.  i got mine the day after i got my approval letter.|`|X6as2nOAaa	Go to the post office and change your address and then they will send it there, you can also go into the department that you signed up for it at and tell them.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	No it won't. I wouldwait until you get the card to change the address because it might slow down the process even more.
kVIOtS5gaa	You should ask your case worker. I was on Medicaid and only qualified for medical care for pregnancy related purposes. I did not qualify for vision/dental. And after delivery of my baby I no longer qualified to be on medical it was just for my pregnancy|`|YiDhb60Paa	it should cover everything. i would call and ask though|`|ntdGOZqGaa	It covers everything. Vison,medical, and dental. I was never treated any different from someone that had reg. insurance.
JEteneuUaa	I shoved my son against the wall and yell  him to stop shaking!!!|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Contact the school principal and guidance counselor; it's the only truly safe way to get something like this to stop. I work in a school and it's a nightmare if parents decide to take things into their own hands and go directly to the bully and their parents. Fights and more problems arise and now that kid knows yours is a squealer (not a bad thing) and will most likely increase their bullying tactics. Ask for a meeting with the principal and counselor and let them contact the other child's parents while you and your son remain anonymous.|`|qqiVKUBpaa	Teach your son to fight so that he can defend himself. Calling the school would probably just make the bullying worse for your son. I don't usually condone violence but that bully is not going to leave him alone and your son shouldn't just have to stand there and be hit. Just teach him to fight with the understanding that it's only okay to fight if he's defending himself. If he gets in trouble you can pretend to be appalled, then you can get in the car, give your kid a high 5 and buy him an ice cream cone for being so brave and standing up for himself.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	Yes, talk to the school.  Most schools have a zero tolerance policy, and the chances are that if he is bullying your son he is also bullying other children.  Doing nothing about it will only allow the situation to escalate.<br>  <br>  I think that you should teach your to defend himself, but be aware that because of those stupid zero tolerance policies, your son will get in just as much trouble as the bully, even if he is defending himself.  It is ridiculous.<br>  <br>  I would have a meeting with the guidance counselor, principal and the parents of the other child-as well as the teacher if they are in the same class.  I would make sure that they are aware you are going to hold them responsible if this continues.<br>  <br>  Another option, through a drastic step, would be to homeschool him.  My children are homeschooled, and this is an issue we just do not deal with.  I do not care what anyone says about "real life", either-in my adult life, I have never encountered a bully and if I did, I certainly would not be afraid to take action to stop him/her.  Homeschooling resembles real life more than a traditional school.|`|GNLYxY7kaa	you need to go to the school, talk to the teacher & then talk to the principle. talk to the children even, see if they know. once you find the child, ask to schedule a meeting at the school with the parents of the bullie and you & your hubby. his parents need to correct his behavior and the teacher needs to be aware of whats going on. the bullie needs to know what he is doing is wrong so it doesnt keep happening to your child or another child. sorry to hear about this, so sad.|`|soFpywFcaa	go into school and threaten the principle your child is supposed to be save there and he is not that boy should not be able to touch him in anyways|`|28QPS6V9aa	You're going to have to have your son handle this one on his own. This is something mommy can't fix. If the bully finds out mommy is protecting her little boy the bullying will only get worse. You can try to teach your son how to defend himself. Teach him how to avoid the bully. But apart from that there isn't much you can do since you don't want to contact the school officials. Another option, is to switch schools, but I only suggest that if the bullying is severe.|`|5i8rtlmXaa	no offense is it possible that he might also be bulling and don't want the other kid to tell on him, that is if it is a family friend.no matter what you need to drill him every day until you find out who it is before its more than just bruises and before it literally drives him to do some thing crazy.I was able to get my 8 year old to tell me a name after I made him sit down at the dinner table the whole time I was cooking and during dinner and even after I was able to drill him asking the same questions over and over and in different ways and getting many different answers and excuses they all pointed to the same person place and time. good luck to you.|`|26yK666Paa	Teach your child to use his words and tell this bully not to touch him.  Once the boundaries have been established and the bully fails to respect your son's space.....teach him where the vulnerable parts on a boy are and tell your son to take action! I would also suggest putting him in a self-defense course to help him build his self-image and confidence. If he hung out with a kid bigger than the bully or enlisted the help of an older sibling (if that's an option), that might be enough of a deterrent.<br>  <br>  I had to deal with a similar situation with my daughter and I told her to slap the boy that she repeatedly told not to hug her (her teacher was aware of the problem and it continued). I told her teacher that she had my permission to smack him and she would do it if they did not take care of the problem.  I did not hear anymore complaints after that.|`|BF5ocegLaa	Bubba B is totally wrong. Don't you dare leave this to your son to handle on his own. He needs to know that you are his advocate and you are willing to do the unpopular thing in order to do what is right. Research has proven that once a parent gets involved and the school that bullying will decrease NOT increase.  Your child needs to know that he is safe and you are willing to go the extra mile despite that you may know the other child. Phone that child's parent and nip this in the bud NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|tRXA3wlUaa	Maybe it is not a friend, maybe he is afraid that you will go to school and it will only get worse. The only thing I can tell you is to try and find out when it is happening, and depending on what grade tell the teacher. If he is older then the only thing you can do it go to the school officials.  <br>  Sorry and good luck!|`|2rGbz9vqaa	My mother had to take me out of school and sent me to private school where I don't pushed around and made fun of any more.|`|9MXG3O74aa	Enroll him in martial arts classes.
prqrQcd1aa	First i'd talk to them about it, tell them to stop and try to get them help...if that didn't work...tough love is sometimes the best love! I'd call the cops on them.|`|5eArOiRxaa	I'd turn her in, definitely.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	Depends on what it was but honestly call the cops on most activities. I caught my sister smoking pot in front of my mothers house. The only reason i didnt call the police is because i thought the girl that was with them wasn't smoking ( i had been wrong) It was something that i didn't need to deal with ( it was summer, we had the guest room window open and they were smoking right bellow it WITH MY DAUGHTER IN THE ROOM) I don't tolerate doing illegal activities because they don't just impact your life but those around you. Ill admit that when i was under the age of 18 I was addicted to drugs and alcohol. But even at 15 there wasn't anything my mother could do ( she didn't really know, i was never home) I ended up going to a mental facility for attempting suicide and it turned my life around. So if rehab or some soft of facility isnt an option the cops would be. If its the first time a serious talking to would be happening. Anything else then the cops would be called.|`|LwbwMFX9aa	depends what it was, if they were dealing drugs, I would give them the option to quit doing it or I would turn them in<br>  <br>  if they were smoking pot or illicit drugs, I would ask them to go to rehab<br>  <br>  if they were a killer, id turn them in|`|AA11537580	depends on what the activity is!<br>  smoking pot, -I wouldn't do anything<br>  growing the stuff in his /her basement while his/her kids are running around upstairs- I would call the cops.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	it would depend on what it was - if it was drugs or property destruction or something harmful to someone else i'd kick his @ss. but if he was making a political statement i'd let it slide.|`|zERIAYmQaa	I cannot believe how many of you are saying call the cops. You need to stand by your kids right, wrong or indifferent. Your reaction should be dependant on what the activity is but it should NEVER be to snitch on your child. You do realize that having a record will ruin their opportunities FOR LIFE with jobs etc... And not having a job is a main force that drives people to illegal activities so by calling the cops, you are starting a vicous chain that will not allow them to stop their wrong behaviors.|`|M21c8MQ9aa	The only thing I would and could do is worry. Your child's an adult and should be responsible enough to know that his avtions have consequences|`|AA12158496	you worry, you can't control your adult children. But would make it REAL plain don't call me for bail money.|`|9N5KJKL2aa	Pray hard. Talk to him/her. Pray harder.|`|BEa18qIzaa	it all depends on what it was, and who all it was harming.

ZHJuK1QNaa	I would think increased gas would more likely be a sign of indigestion.     I guess anything is possible......If you are pregnant and cramping Implantation of the embryo could be occurring, you may even spot when that happens.  Both of those are completely normal. There is no need to freak out, in 12 days you'll know for sure.  So just burp (or what ever) your little head off and be prepared for which ever it may be.<br>  Good Luck.|`|p0prrzf2aa	usually pregnancy cramps feel like regular period cramps. gas could be a sign of ANYTHING.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I think I got gas too, but it may be too early to get symptoms. I had gas a few days before my period was to start. It could be ovulation cramping though. They feel similar.
SQf0M6wBaa	Breast milk is the perfect food and it is used rapidly by the infant.The milk does not have to go through a long digestive process. I would suggest that you nurse your infant every 2 hours that you are awake.There is one "long" period in 24 hours and you want that to come at night. So, if you are up,don`t be worried about waking the baby and nursing him.You can never over-feed breast milk.Good luck and I hope this was helpful.|`|AA11885437	is he gaining weight okay and meeting milestones? My son went from eating 20 min on each side in the hospital to eating every 1.5-2 hours at home, 5-10 min (10 at the MOST) on only one side. I think the difference was that when my milk came in he was getting more faster and his doctor was a little concerned that he was only eating such a short time but said we would see how his weight check turned out after a week. His weight was perfect, gaining an ounce a day and he has plenty of wet and dirty diapers, so its getting in! while eating for 20-30 min might me normal for some babies, eating for 5-10 min is normal for mine and as long as he is growing and is having a good number of wet and dirty diapers there is nothing to worry about. I would continue to nurse to whatever schedule he has set for himself. babies will take in what they need, no more no less. I wouldnt hassle with pumping and bottle feeding unless he is loosing weight.|`|8brZAonnaa	my son was drinking 5-6 oz every 4 hours at this age try get him to go 3 hours put him off with cooled boiled water if you have to then try extend him to 4 hours if he is asleep wake him up for his sechudled feed this will also help him sleep longer at nite|`|51jVOdq5aa	Theres actually no perfect answer regarding the number of ML when feeding breastmilk is concern. I would say based on my experience when the baby latches and is satisfied he/she would normally stop latching and you would normally feel your breast weighing down. I tried pumping a lot of times and offer him a bottle, luckily my son feeds both directly from my breast and on a bottle. My pediatrician suggested that 8 wks baby needs to be fed every  2-3 hours. Listen and take a cue from your baby if he/she is still hungry. Normally they would cry if they are but also take note of the babys wet diaper per day. You would normally see 4 or more wet diapers a day for a well hydrated and well fed baby. Otherwise feed him longer and more often.

P0Fjh59Eaa	Legal for them to expect their services to be paid for...yes.<br>  Do you not have insurance? most clinics or hospitals have the right (if they choose) to refuse services if non-payment is received.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  if you have insurance then that must be the co-pay, or services that your insurance wont pay. you need to get in touch with the clinic and see if they will work w/you on making payments.|`|M6c0hUefaa	My doctor's office did the same thing. I had insurance with BCBS and my ob clinic called them to find out how much they'd pay for, and what was left for me to pay.

The only time they can't refuse your care is if you are in labor and you go to an emergency room.|`|51jVOdq5aa	I am a little confuse why you need to pay such amount if you have insurance. However some clinic/doctors actually have a preference on the types of insurance that they accept. It would have been wise to ask them first if they would accept your insurance and the copays that your responsible for in every visit. Other than that youll be responsible for everything that the insurance company wont pay.|`|YiDhb60Paa	time to get medicaid. you will get it cause your pregnant

E047GSKdaa	I would.  I would have a test time first.  Have you over while I do housework/yard work.  <br>  A lot also depends on maturity.  I would ask questions like "what would you do if you were giving baby a bath and the phone rang?"  If you do not know, you aren't prepared to babysit.|`|1s3nddaYaa	i would, cause you have to start some where. everyone is looking for experience but how can you get it if no one will ever hire you|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	I would as long as I felt comfortable with you and my kids liked you. It would just depend on how we got along, how old you were, how I felt about you, etc. <br>  <br>  As long as I trusted you to watch my children I would not care if you have babysat other children that weren't related to you. I started off babysitting family as well, then my mom's employee's kids, and now other children. <br>  <br>  I do understand how you are feeling. You want to babysit but can't unless you babysit. It's a catch 22.|`|kyu0VRr9aa	Have good friends of the family who know you and your personality write characture references. If people see that others trust you it will be easier for them to trust you too. Also try babysitting for an older child first then work your way down to younger children.|`|LwbwMFX9aa	no and the reason why ? I have a child with autism, even though hes well tempered and speaks and is high functioning if he gets out of sorts , its like a cyclone so it has to be someone who is very strong and patient|`|prqrQcd1aa	Maybe if i knew them...but i'm very particular when it comes to my children!|`|9N5KJKL2aa	I started babysitting neighbors kids & church kids at 12.

2u3ze0Asaa	I think its Dr. Seuss we love you?<br>  :D i dont know.
SzNmGV0Daa	Believe it or not, it feels like it all comes out but as long as you lay down after for at least 15minutes than only half will come out. The cervix is self sealing, once the sperm get into the uterus they begin their journey up :) The majority of sperm live for two days in the uterus, so the prime time to try would be to start two days prior to ovulation and then have fun for that week as much as you can. Goodluck to you and your family :)|`|soFpywFcaa	sperm lives in you for 72 hours and more............its better to have sex every other day so you dont lower sperm count|`|oHNrktxTaa	Sperm can live up to 48 hours. However, when it is fertile CM, the sperm can tend to live up to 3-5 days.<br>  <br>  Also, keep in mind that there are million of sperm that get released. It is impossible for all to leak out. They are in there.<br>  <br>  Try & prop a pillow beneath you & hold your legs up for 20 min.s. It will help keep the sperm flow to where it needs to go.<br>  <br>  Baby Dust to you!|`|qCe9Pnlgaa	I wondered the same thing, actually. We wanted a girl so we abstained 2 days prior to ovulation and didn't get preg. It was when we had sex 1-2 times every single day that it happened. Keep going, 1-2 times a day for the next week. :) You should get preggo!!! Good luck!
hVVALFAPaa	Think about when the baby was in the womb. He experienced smooth repetitive motions when mommy walked. They got used to this motion and after birth, prefer it above others. That is why babies enjoy being rocked (swing, rocking chair, mommy's arms, the little "mommy sway" we all instinctively do when we see a babe.)<br>  <br>  Baby wearing (putting the babe in a chest carrier or sling) is comparable to the 'womb/walking sensation' plus he is near you and can hear your heartbeat, etc. or he can look up and see your face, hear your voice. When he gets a bit older, he can look around better and see what you see.<br>  <br>  So any repetitive motion is preferred (swing, rocking chair, baby wearing,) then the motion of a stroller or pram would be next. The gentle vibrations of the rolling wheels is soothing to them, too.<br>  <br>  I would recommend switching between  motions. Obviously, you don't just want to stick your babe in a swing all day. He needs motion but also different sorts of stimulation -- swing, holding, rocking, strolling-- but also needs time to be still and just lay there.|`|rFtKFp03aa	Carrier is suggested because baby benefits from being close to mom, and hearing the heart beat.,. <br>  <br>  I would use a rocking chair before I got a buggy to use to rock him... other wise just use a swing, right? <br>  <br>  If I was rocking my baby constantly I would want to be holding him/her.... <br>  <br>  taking her out where?? just out???  that isn't necessary.. We don't go out every day.. although if your kid hasn't seen sunlight in a few weeks.. then I would probably try and get out more.. <br>  <br>  It sounds like you are doing fine.. with what you are doing.. <br>  <br>  Although, how old is your child?? Im slightly confused on your situation..<br>  <br>  EDIT - I think it is nice that it is nice enough where you are for your baby to sleep outside.. I would love for my little ones to be able to nap outside when it is warmer.. <br>  <br>  What you are doing is fine I think.. I wouldn't think your child would suffer from not being pushed in a stroller.. You are a loving hands on parent... thats what matters most..|`|u94HOVz7aa	they suggest on the chest in carrier because hearing the heart calms the baby it reminds them of in the womb.  and a carrier frees your hand while still allowing you to snuggle baby.  i know my babies favorite place is in my baby wrap or sling on my chest.  strollers work if you gently sway them when you are at a stop. i do this when i'm out and not using my carrier.
AA11296427	A hint is like a clue.<br>  <br>  :]<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: for example. Imagine you have a girlfriend and you are out shopping. She sees a great pair of heels and says ''aww, i would love those heels - they would match perfectly with my dress'' she is HINTING that she want them.|`|jWo9lCqQaa	are you asking what hints mean what or are you asking what they men when they drop hints?

Best of luck and tell your cousin to keep the baby if any idea's of abortion comes up.|`|DTkAVdk4aa	Don’t panic.  I’ve never even had a real boyfriend, but my Mom is a nurse and my Dad is a cop so we’ve had this talk a lot!  My aunt has a 4 year old kid.  Before she got pregnant she used those home pregnancy tests a lot.  Sometimes they are wrong so the first thing you may want to do is get a second opinion.  If it turns out that you are really pregnant you should tell your parents because you are going to need their help.  Your parents will take you to a doctor.  I hope you keep your baby, but whether you do or not, it is important that you start taking really good care of yourself because you need nourishment for two people now.<br>  <br>  Don’t let the mean things other people say bother you - - you’ve already got enough to worry about!  I’m a geek, not very pretty, and my Dad is a cop so I will probably NEVER have a boyfriend!  I hope the baby daddy is a nice guy and helps you do the right thing.<br>  <br>  Since you have a computer, you may also want to google teenage pregnancy and do some reading.

0nIwKd5Uaa	If he is paying his child support and actually wants to be in your son's life and stay in his life why not let him?|`|prqrQcd1aa	Just because his name isn't on the birth certificate doesn't mean he's not the father...obviously otherwise he wouldn't be paying child support.<br>  I say let him see the child, maybe at first with supervised visitation since the child does not know him..and then build up to over night visits. It's not right to keep the father out of his life.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	what is TEA? I assume it's not the beverage. he pays child support because the government pays you? and what part of this scenario was not your choice? don't make it worse by not allowing him to see his child. good grief.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	get a lawyer and fas as youll need someone to reperesent you. channces are a paternity test will have to be taken and then if hes proven a fit father he will be granted access to your child:)|`|AA12074512	go to court and tell the truth about him.. good luck.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	well hope he get is right in court,,,,after all he the dad ,,|`|3EiOobEVaa	Go to court and tell the truth. And if it gets to the point get a lawyer. My sister is going through the same thing but she chose to put her baby's father on child support since he has only sent her 110.00 since september and a box of diapers that were too little. On the other hand he has a history of being violent every time they see each other. So just tell the truth and everything will work itself out|`|FBHhvGHNaa	well if your baby daddy wants to take you to court, you should tell the judge that he hasn't done much for you nor your child since the birth. have some sort of proof or have witness that knows that he hasn't given you much for your child.|`|LwbwMFX9aa	dont have a baby with someone who's a loser honey and theres nothing wrong with hand me downs.

wXh4QpaYaa	To answer your question, yes, she did call you a whore. Unfortunately, some people are just jerks like that. If you posted exactly what she said, I can see no indication of her race bashing you right there. <br>  <br>  Also, I would like to point out that, while the klan meeting comment is understandable, the trailer comment is not. I know many people (including my parents) that live in trailers that go to school full time and hold down jobs, work hard almost everyday, pay their own bills, etc, just like you do.<br>  <br>  Good for you for trying to do what is best for your baby and yourself. you just have to try to brush it off. Some people are on here just to irritate others.|`|NUc6Aw9Gaa	She had no right to assume anything about you but i don't think that anything in it sounds racist.<br>  <br>  She seemed a bit too quick to judge you but you kind of did the same with the racism thing.

Older men with money are the best men to be with, especially if they already have one foot in the grave =) idk 28 and 48???? kinda gross to me but whatever floates your boat|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	That was extremely rude. It's not like the guy is a stranger to you. I'm sure that woman had sex before she was married. It only takes one sperm to get pregnant. You are 28, you are not a child and are very capable of taking care of a child. It's not like you're a teen in high school. (I'm not saying a teen would be a bad mom, it's just that at 28 you've lived a lot of life before having a child). <br>  <br>  That actually sounds kind of racist to me too. Good luck to you in your pregnancy. I hope that you raise your child not to be a bigot and respect people, unlike this woman.|`|b9MSOr6laa	she did and obviously she is wrong<br>  <br>  u don't deserve to have some b**** insult u just because she has nothing more useful to do w/ her life<br>  <br>  congratulations btw|`|H2IhRXIIaa	No you wernt.

Hope all goes well|`|xnhwmontaa	I agree with you. thats messed up. Good for you! its better than being a welfare whore like some people|`|tivpa7Vlaa	well if she felt so racist today i guess she should know who runs the country now....also i despise people who go on and on about their tax money because we have no control over getting taxed and where our tax money is going. its up to the government to what our tax money goes to. whether there was financial aid to the poor or not we will get taxed no matter what. f%@k everyone i pay taxes and i am on medicaid and i get food stamps y? cause its available and takes off a few bills i don't have to worry about. i am 28 and had a baby with my boyfriend and we are a very happy family.  help is out there to be use by those who qualify so i take it...why not?|`|u4FUeppNaa	ha ha wow first off a husband has no more obligation to stay or support you then a boyfriend does. i mean is a marriage license really going to keep someone there is if they don't want to be...also lots of people automatically assume that any unwed mother is on welfare of some sort. I agree with you completely, i hate when people leave rude or ignorant responses to real questions.|`|Coc593Ikaa	Wow, way to return assumptive judgementalism with more assumptions. There is nothing in her answer to indicate that her views had anything to do with your skin color, so the klan meeting bit was over-the-top. Yes, she was out of line with the medicaid bit, but you are out of line as well.|`|ocwIcfzPaa	Some people believe strongly that you need to be married to have children. <br>  <br>  Don't worry about it.<br>  I am also 28. My husband is 51. We have three children and been married 8 years. It's not the worst thing in the world lol! : )|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	that is horrible. you can't assume and judge just b/c your having a baby with your boyfriend that your on welfare and such.|`|TXddP0uxaa	Please don't immediately assume racism.  It doesn't help anyone for all of us to name call and point fingers whenever there is unkind words thrown about.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, I agree that this woman's comments were harsh and even hostile.  She's making assumptions about you because of your situation not your color:  you're unmarried, pregnant, with a boyfriend that sounds kind of jerky...she probably figures that also means you have no money either.  I'm not defending what she said, but don't let yourself get all worked up by a person who forms her opinions from one ethnocentric perspective and doesn't really understand other realities exist.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Good lord!! That lady does seem very rude, people are very rude now days and need to learn when to shut up. I'm sorry that she said that to you, honestly who's business is it if you are receiving government asst. that is no one else's problem. That is honestly why it is there, so I guess she feels like if you aren't a millionaire then you have no business having children? Dont worry its not just bc of your skin color people have said some really nasty things to me on here too and I'm white lol Just keep your head up and know that atleast you can go to bed without having to lay there and think about all the mean and nasty things you said to someone. Good luck|`|X1ACfL8eaa	I don't think you were called a whore, I think you just encountered someone who is obviously ignorant to life!  Just because a woman uses medicaid to pay for their health insurance doesn't make her an animal not worthy to have children AND doesn't mean she doesn't work hard herself!<br>   As far as the rest of this persons judgmental comments it just seems to me that people like this are just very unhappy with themselves.|`|sNv4VEM6aa	Sounds like someone is still living in the days where your husband is chosen for you and you shall birth children to him and him only and if you were to be unfaithful then off with their heads.<br>  <br>  Honey don't listen to who eva wrote that answer, i'm not a single mother but i'm not married and i'm pregnant with my second. If you feel you can handle the pregnancy and the child then you go for it... Only do wat you feel you're able to handle.|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	I don't think that was a racial slur she made, but a strong and clearly incorrect accusation about you as a person. She is clearly bitter about something in her life, to take it out on a complete stranger.  She also doesn't know anything about parental rights... clearly this is coming from someone with a sever lack of intelligence. Don't take things so personally from strangers. At the end of the day, they don't matter and what they say doesnt matter. Opinions are like As#holes, everybody's got one. <br>  <br>   Sorry you were treated with such harsh words. Im sure you will do just fine, and have faith in yourself hun...hugs|`|plI0WOrUaa	it sounds like that person was pretty damn harsh for sure.  People here sometimes I think just like to come on and insult people.  Just let it roll off your back because obviously this person is an asshole who just jumps to conclusions.

Its not 1920 anymore, and this person seems to be stuck there, racism and all.|`|q51cevqLaa	That answer doesn't sound about race.  Sorry but it doesn't.

I just ignore these people.

QH5oOFutaa	My daughter was 3 years old when I got pregnant with number 2......her father was never around, I ended up leaving him so it was me and her for the first 3 years of her life (besides when my husband came into the picture.) But still, even after we got married, she was the only child and I was sooooo worriied that she would hate the baby and be mad at me etc etc. I felt the same way you do. I told her when I was about 3 mths and suprisingly she was sooooo excited. She went to every appt with me and my husband and we made her involved in every way possible. So she suprised me! My son is now almost 2 and she will be 6 in June.....they are the best of friends :) She is soooo good with him, its amazing. My husband and I are on #3 now (I started showing early lol) so I told her at about 8 weeks....shes thrilled again! Just try and keep your daughter involved in everything possible (besides the birth) I didnt want my daughter to see me in all that pain, and didnt want her seeing everything that went on. Im sure everything will be fine. Congrats to you and enjoy!!|`|HWeajklaaa	Wait untill you're out of the "danger zone" of miscarrying, and make sure the baby is healthy first. Trust me, my mom's thrid to last pregnancy ended badly due to anencephally, i was 10, my sister was 8 and my two brothers were 6 and 4. I'm not saying anything is wrong wiht your baby or anyhting, it's jsut that was really tramtic for all of us becasue my mom told us even before she was 3 months, her last two pregnacies she waited untill she was a little over 3 months. and i wouldnt worry about it, little kids are generally all psyched up to big a big brother or sister, it's after the baby is born and they decide they want you to take the baby back to the hospital you've got to be concerned with.|`|MxxtlTN4aa	just explain to her that a baby is groing in ur stomache and if she loves dolls use those to exlain to her as well,and when the baby is born(congrats)make sure u give her atention too i know it may be hard with a new baby but let her be with u as much as possible<br>  good luck.|`|BdVNsbPraa	as soon as possible|`|VR9KhbEgaa	I waited until I was past the 20 week mark to tell my kids. That way I could say "you are having a brother/sister". I never showed before then so it was no big deal with them asking questions prior to that time. I would just recommend waiting until you are least out of your first trimester to ensure everything is going well with the pregnancy.
P0Fjh59Eaa	My children didn't sleep on a pillow till they were 2 yrs old, and in a toddler bed.|`|X6as2nOAaa	My 7 month old sleeps with a pillow she has been doing that for about a month.|`|AA10091300	1-2 years old. They can suffocate on a pillow any younger than that and it is bad for their necks|`|j7Mxfr1yaa	my son is 13 months old and i haven't come anywhere close to thinking about using a pillow i probably won't till he is in a big boy bed and even then who knows how long i will wait.... its not concious he just seams to sleep fine without one and he moves around a lot so i don't think his head would even stay on a pillow while he is sleeping|`|8Cvv86Jeaa	Id say after a year. Just to avoid SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome) They say not to have anything in the crib or wherever the baby sleeps until after a year. To avoid suffocation. See with adults, if something is blocking our path of breathing we know to move. Babies don't they just stop. :(|`|DvWGTzLUaa	Recommended age is a year I believe. Some children will start using teddies etc when they start wanting a pillow though.|`|uYDoPNv9aa	i'm not sure depeneds on the baby and how it sleeps durning the night. like if it moves around a lot...my baby is 3 weeks and i have a bug a boo stroller its a pretty big stroller and i put my baby on a pillow and she loves it.|`|pSmq8GWuaa	2...when you move then to a toddler/twin bed.
2LNNY4Pgaa	should be every month..<br>  thankyou for doing this.. <br>  i think you would get more when your off work..|`|ergk5yLiaa	They normally woulld give itn to you before giving birth|`|uGinKU6Baa	It's given to you each month as long as you remain pregnant.<br>  Hopefully you have childcare and gas mileage reimbursement included as well in your contract in addition to other costs.
0nIwKd5Uaa	Get some Prune juice, apple juice, white grape juice or even Pear juice. they all will loosen him up.  For a day give him things that are lighter on the stomach. Jello, fresh fruits, fresh vegetables. Limit his intake of cheese, milk and other things till he is going. Also give him some pedialite while your working on him going so he doesn't get dehydrated.<br>  <br>  After this make sure he drinks plenty of water on a daily bases it will help this from happening again.|`|ubo0HWtVaa	give apple juice and no banannas. prune juice, <br>  rub his belly with baby oil, counter clockwise and hopefully it will be soon. what has he been eating- it may be something he's eating that's causing the constipation!!|`|kziIf0r6aa	Get down to your chemist if not your local gp, sounds like a bad case of constipation you may just need to put some coloxyl drops in their drink to help pass the stool.  Otherwise fibre fibre fibre feed them up on heaps of things that will help soften their bowels.  So long as they are keps hydrated and able to wee, you may even need to put some cream around his bottom helping the poop come out a little easier and not burn when t does actually come time to pass.|`|XNnuqQQ1aa	Sounds like constipation.  Load him/her up with apple juice.  If that doesn't work get them an enema.  Good luck
X5nrQK6Baa	I know this is going to sound horrible...<br>  This is something you would have to try on a day you aren't going anywhere and have time to give him a bath. <br>  <br>  1.don't bother with the pull up on this day, make him wear undies. <br>  2. If he wets himself...don't change him or offer him anything else to change into. He isn't allowed to sit on the furniture in his wet attire (unless it isn't upholstered)<br>  3. Inform him that as soon as he goes potty in the toilet like a big boy he has to stay in his wet clothes. <br>  <br>  Kids don't like being in their own filth. And I know this also sounds cruel, but if there are some other kids around that are a bit older...this is one time when peer pressure isn't so bad. It will be embarrasing and probably harder for you to deal with than him. But, if you stick to your guns, he isn't going to want to go in his pants anymore. <br>  <br>  <br>  Like I said, I know it sounds horrible, but when all else failed, I tried it. It worked. Sadly its how my parents had to go with my little brother when we were growing up. <br>  <br>  At the end of the day though...for both of your sakes, give him a bath and let him wear a pull up to bed. <br>  <br>  <br>  Another thing to get him interested in it would be to have him take a shower (if he is up for those yet) and tell him to aime for the drain. My step son loves doing that. He thinks its hilarious. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|VXcp8hvHaa	monkey see, monkey do|`|83b41af6e9dad5161f377d8dd731e945aa	I let mine run around with a naked  bottom and gave him a lot to drink.<br>  <br>  As soon as the flow starts, put on the potty (sitting).  If you are quick, then some will actually MAKE it in there.  Show him the pee in the potty, praise him, give him the reward.  Tell him he gets that reward each time.<br>  <br>  keep him naked for a few more wee- wees.  With any luck, he'll understand the rules of the program and go with it.<br>  <br>  You will need a full day dedicated to this... and a carpet cleaner.<br>  <br>  I suggest rewarding him with hotwheels cars.. buy like 20 of them.. and then start recycling the ones from the beginning.   Mine never figured out he was getting his own hot wheels back for a 2nd and 3rd time.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|xy5UNiELaa	My son didn't want to either.  I know the experts say don't push them, but he's starting preschool soon, so we had to do something.  Anyway, I put real underwear on him.  He so did not like peeing on himself.  So we switched to pull-ups.  We just took him to the bathroom every 15 minutes and had him at least sit on the potty.  After about two days, he tinkled.  We just kept at it.  When he got used to it, we would take him every hour.  Now he tells us when he's gotta go.  If he's too busy playing, we make it a point to ask him (a lot) if he has to go.  He's doing well, although he won't poop yet.  We're working on that one.  Good luck!|`|8QiVEGNsaa	they say that eventually kids wont want to keep being wet & having to wear diapers when other kids their age arent. also, try different rewards, like maybe if he pees in the toilet for a week he can go to chuckiecheese or something.|`|KV590Y6Saa	I saw a clip  on the news about a lady who did a potty boot camp.  Real undies, only.  Lots of juice and salty snacks (makes them thirstier) and sitting on the potty alot.  She had great success.|`|0ky4TktEaa	Time to resort to a spanking. A normal, healthy child should have at least begun to try by 3 years old. Expand to more than just taking the snacks away. Take toys/movies/any other form of entertainment he loves. Take deserts away as well. Reduce everything to the bare minimum when he does not cooperate. <br>  <br>  Stop using the pull ups except for at bed time or during naps. Put him in underwear, possibly with the rubber pants as well. If he pitches a fit about wanting the pull up to go in, let him pitch his fit but don't cave in and put him in a pull up. This will become a test of wills and you don't want him thinking you're  a pushover than can be manipulated by screaming fits etc. <br>  <br>  Every hour on the hour, make him go sit on it and try. If he doesn't go, give him a very firm reminder that he better keep those underwear dry. If within the next 30 minutes he wets himself, give him a spank and sit him in time out. Tell him he loses a favorite toy for the rest of the night. If you can keep this up, he should be trained within a month at most. Don't get lazy and give him the pull ups to avoid having to clean up messes. Give him a spank, send him to timeout, temporarily take a toy/desert etc away for the rest of the night (notice i said a combination of all three not just one or another). If the mess is just pee, have him help clean up. Make him do most of the work in cleaning himself up. <br>  <br>  He will eventually get tired of having things taken, spankings and time outs and he'll get it together. The other benefit to doing this is you will establish a proper parent-child relationship. That is one along the lines of "i love you and still, you do this because I said to do it even if you don't like it"|`|kziIf0r6aa	Get daddy to go pee in the big boys toilet with him get a ping pong ball and get them both to aim for it, make it a game dont threaten things like snacks being taken away from him.  Make up a chart and everytime he uses the big boys toilet he gets a star and each week he gets a small prize nothing too extravagant tho.  If he needs to do a poop get a more comfortbale chair that attaches to the big boys loo and sit and sing songs an read books to help him relax it may be that he's just scared.  Maybe invest in some underpants and encourage him to tell you whe he needs the toilet giving him the opportunity to be a big boy...|`|BrYMh9pRaa	With my son, I found the easiest way to get things moving towards potty training was to have him pee standing up, like a big boy. You can usually tell when he needs to go, and then have him stand there and encourage him to go until he does, no matter how long it takes. That worked for me too when I was babysitting and I guess I learned a lot from that.You have to persevere and keep at it.|`|uhg5fWMraa	my sister had the same problem fortunately she had just gotten a new car which he loves to go in & she said he couldnt go for a ride in case he had an accident he started going on he potty|`|653f29fd2c842f2aad32073beddf9590aa	Quit Pull Ups and diapers all together!  I have three children (two that are completely potty trained and have been since 2 1/2 years old)  <br>  <br>  It took my son a few days to concept that if he peed it would run down his leg and he stopped pooping all together (only for three days)<br>  Just explain to him that he is a big boy and he can even help you get rid of the pull ups, stay in for a few days and if you have to go somewhere just take a couple of extra suits of clothes and socks.<br>  <br>  My son and daughter wet the bed about two times before they realized that they had to get up so make sure you have a mattress protector.   I think pull ups confuse these children.<br>  <br>  I never did any of the sitting on the potty stuff.  They told me when thay had to go.  I would usually try to ask every 30 min but if they said no I took them at their word.  If they had an accident then I changed them and told them it was okay, we'd try again next time.  Remember to reward for using the potty, but do not punish for accidents.<br>  ~Good Luck~<br>  Please do not listen to "Step Mom" in my eyes and many others that is child cruelty!  Who would want to embarrass their child in that manner or any manner!!  Punishment is going to cause resentment and will make things much harder than they have to be!  He will potty train when HE is ready... I mean really how many 6 year olds are still in diapers?

j8y8kcbNaa	Written towards your gf:<br>  My opinion? You're both idiots. With all due respect of course. Obviously he is gonna see you slapping a guys *** as sexual because he's your boyfriend and what he sees is you touching some other guy rather than him, not a friend being playful; it's not his fault it's just a common natural psychological response. And as for you flashing, his friends will now tease him about the time his gf flashed the bar (not infront of you of course) so i could see that as being a factor of why he was bothered. Now onto him, he needs to learn that you being close to other guys does not mean you will turn into the woman that cheated on him in the past. And he needs to learn to accept your personality.<br>  <br>  I stated that you're both idiots because this isn't a matter of fault it's a matter of understanding each others point of view. The sooner you can figure out that you need to examine the abstract reasons behind disagreements before labeling and cementing concrete ideas like being jealous or disrespectful, the better off you'll be|`|V780bRMRaa	He's probably just worried that you're going to cheat again but as long as you didn't mean it to be sexual, there's nothing wrong with it. Maybe you should just not to it AS MUCH... that would be my suggestion. Good luck :)|`|AA10719818	I would never do the things you say you did, because I have respect for my husband, and would never do anything to put our relationship in jeopardy.<br>  Whether you consider it innocent or not, it's bugging him.  If you want it to last and you care about him, you should start taking that into consideration.<br>  If you were in a relationship for 18 years, you obviously arent a kid.  Why you are egging someone on to flash someone and then you doing just seems immature anyway.  Mabe you shouldn't be in a relationship.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|26yK666Paa	I think if he loves you, he should accept you the way you are.  If you love him, you should be sensitive to what upsets him.  With that said, you two need to discuss and meet somewhere in the middle.  Maybe a counselor could help guide you two.  You didn't say how long you have been involved with this man but it sounds fairly new.  You sound like an independent, confident woman and he's probably very attracted to that but threatened at the same time.  Sometimes what attracts us to a person in the beginning gets annoying when you are in a committed relationship.  It would be better to find out if he's in fact controlling which could lead to abuse down the road or if it's something on your end that causes you to attract a controlling type of man (unhealthy relationships)....do you see a pattern?  I think as long as the rest of the relationship is in good shape, this could be an obstacle you two could overcome and be stronger together depending on the outcome.  It's good to deal with conflict in a relationship (and every relationship will have issues) because it can show you how that person fights and how hard he is willing to work on the issues or if he let's them fester and is unconfrontational and passive aggressive. Good luck!|`|bRLWDEgraa	I think you should be old enough to know better. Stop acting like an attention grabbing child,  and give your boyfriend the respect he deserves.  If you aren't keen on changing you ways,  or you still don't feel your boyfriend is being fair,  then I say end the relationship and let that be that.  Life is too short for that kind of petty bullsh*t.|`|xC9SIZbGaa	You gotta reassure him, no matter how annoying it is.. tbh tho i'd be annoyed as hell if my gf flashed anything to anyone, let alone smackin other guys on the ***.. maybe u just need to consider ur actions too that have obviously offended him.. <br>  <br>  One thing to remember is - your intentions mean F-All.. your actions however mean everything.. u can explain what ur intentions were but overall I think u just need to plan ur "playful" behavior so not to upset him so much..<br>  <br>  You're also probably a little paranoid about him being controlling - I really don't think it's anything unusual to be upset over flirty behavior..|`|r4UgFabFaa	hes being overly jeaulous and clingy so to say|`|TRsJEsvDaa	I think he may be a little jealous, but only because your actions would make most men jealous. It is usually a good rule of thumb not to slap other guys on the *** infront of your boy friend. Any guy would have a problem with that. Just try to be more aware of how things might make him feel and you guys should be alright.
XhIYAH6Laa	For me the spinal didn't really hurt at all, although I was already in labor so that pain was minimal compared..lol I did however just have a spinal tap a couple months ago and it barely hurt for me, and I have a zero pain tolerance. As for the recovery...it really wasn't as bad as some people say. I was given 800mg tylenol and actual pain meds...only ever took the tylenol. I didn't have too many problems taking care of my son during recovery, and bounced right back. It takes a little extra time than a vaginal delivery to heal but it really isn't that bad! Good Luck and Congrats on your little one!|`|ntdGOZqGaa	the spinal is more like a pinch, just enough to make me say ow then it was over. The time it took to recover from the c section was a while. I got no pain meds only the first night then after that I had motrin just reg motrin you buy at the store, so for me I was really sore and walked really slow. But I did good taking care of myself and my son afterwards. Just plan on being slow and being sore for a while its not so much the pain of it just the soreness|`|smcWIZxPaa	Ok well I had an epidural first because I was in labor for a long time before they decided to give me a c-section.  There were pros and cons.  The spinal didn't hurt but it scared me more than anything because nobody told me that it is going to make you go completely numb so quickly.  I thought it would take longer so it just frightened me a little bit.  It was so tingly for a few minutes but then it evened out and you are just plain numb.  It didn't hurt at all though.  It was just a little pinch to get it in.  I would say it hurts just about as much as getting an IV put in.  The 2 things I didn't like about the c section though were you are awake and if anything goes wrong you are fully aware because you can hear them (i had bleeding complications).  and they press down really hard on your belly to deliver the baby.  I really thought they broke my ribs but I was just bruised.  In recovery wasn't too bad, I didn't have much pain because I had an epidural in for the whole next day.  My tailbone hurt so much after because I couldn't feel it because of the epidural and I was sitting awkwardly for 2 days.  When i went home I just took the pain meds and I was fine.  Just take it easy and make sure you take the meds if you can and try and sleep when the baby sleeps.  I was just sore but I was fully recovered about 6 weeks after.|`|8WNwHBAuaa	Dont worry. Its not that bad. The needle may hurt a little going in but it last for a very short time. The recovery period is said to be 6 weeks, but to be honest with you, the doctors say that to cover themselves adn you should be fine in a week or two. I dont know if this is your 1st, but i have had both a normal birth and c-section, and each has its pros and cons. You dont bleed for as long after a c-section, but the first few days are weird, being bedbound. you'll be fine

kUCVLuTPaa	woop him and get him a tutor|`|LddkW0JFaa	Have you had his eyes checked? Is he feeling OK? Could he be sick?|`|tRXA3wlUaa	You need to find the source of the problem. Maybe the work is too easy for him and he don't want to do it. My brother use to act the same way in school and it was because he felt like the work was too easy for him. Try to explain to him that if he don't settle down and get the work done, he will have to repeat the grade.  If that don't work, talk to the school about what can be done, to help him.<br>  Good Luck!|`|5i8rtlmXaa	try sitting down with him to do the extra math he may be crying out for your attention we all get so busy also try a change of routine maybe sit outside with him while he is doing his work and talk to him at the same time.read his planner out loud in front of him and be real nice and say something like honey I don't understand what you are trying to tell me because you did  not finish and he might try harder if he is getting good positive attention. and when he does what  he is supposed to make a big happy deal to let him know his hard work is being seen.just be consistent and positive.|`|5q7uPqVmaa	So sorry that you're having a hard time!  I each fourth-grade and hate to see a kid having a hard time when his parents are helping himi out as much as possible at home.    Here's an easy thing to do with his planner:  ask his teacher to sign the planner every night to make sure that his assignments are written down correctly.  I do this everyday for all the kids in my class and honestly it doesn't take more than about 5 minutes to sign everybody's planner and give them their homework (although I do have them in the habit of lining up at the end of the day so we have a bit of an assembly line thing going).  Gives me a chance to make sure the homework's written down correctly and I can also write a short note if I need to or answer a question if the parent has one.<br>  When you helop your son with the assignments, does it seem like he has a hard time with the work or just isn't doing it?  As a teacher, there's a big difference between a child who simply isn't doing assignments and getting bad grades because of it and a child who simply has no clue what's going on.  If your son is consistently having trouble independently completing assignments (by which I mean he can do the work on his own without your help, even if you have to sit next to him to make sure he completes the work), there might be something troubling him or he's looking for your attention.<br>  If he seems to have trouble understanding what he's supposed to be doing or has trouble retaining things you've shown him, you might want to look into having him evaluated to see if there's a learning difficulty (could be something as simple as he's having a hard time seeing the words on the paper or the board and is reluctant saying that).|`|RKTNDLDKaa	Be patient.    Try to use some understanding to get to the bottom of things.      Don't just assume it's laziness on his part.     There may be some reason why he's doing so poorly in school if it's never been a problem before.  <br>  <br>  Is he being bullied by another student?     Has he fallen behind and now not understanding the material and is afraid to ask for help?    Does he get made fun of for asking questions in class?    Is he trying to fit in with other kids by being "dumb" or blowing off his school work?     Is he having trouble concentrating on the work?    Is he having a problem with his eyesight?   Has there been a family issue that could be bothering him (a death, birth of a new baby, move to a new home, change of schools, divorce, remarriage, etc)    Try talking to the teacher to find out if she has any idea as to why your son is behaving this way.  She may have noticed something that you haven't.  <br>  <br>  Ask the teacher to email you each day with the assignments that your son is suppose to be doing.   Most teachers won't mind to give you the week of assignments by personal note or email.   <br>  <br>  Require that your son bring home his text books each night even though he might not have homework.    Sit with him at the table and help him go through it.    You can read a book; you can pay bills, look through recipe books, just anything so that you're sitting there and available.     Just encourage him to do well.   Let him know that if he does not try and master the material then the school will hold him back while his friends move on to the next grade.  <br>  <br>  Understanding really is the best.

However, you may just be having regular light bleeding that sometimes occurs in early pregnancy. However, because you don't know for sure which it is, you need to go to the ER immediately.|`|98WKYtfwaa	You're not supposed to do any heavy lifting at any stage in pregnancy. It could be nothing, or it could be the start of a miscarriage, get seen to by your doctor. I hope all is well.|`|xq7S9H5Raa	why not call your doctor's emergency line or call the ER a.s.ap.|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	What colored bleeding is it? If it is bright red i would phone your Dr or local hospital. I hope it is just spotting but you need to get it checked out. I am 6 weeks today and i have been brown spotting since the day before my period was due, i have done this with my last 3 pregnancies, but once it has stopped it has never come back. Please let us know how you get on. Good luck..|`|Q05rrSX4aa	You could be having a miscarriage, or it could be nothing, either way since you are bleeding and you did lift something heavy you need to see a doctor right now.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, I hope it is nothing, and make sure not to lift heavy things anymore.|`|umca7pwoaa	That you need to go to the ER! It could mean more than one thing but since you are in your first trimester your miscarriage risk is high and adding the combination of lifting something heavy, that you're not supposed to do while pregnant, adds to that risk.|`|kyqhMuSiaa	Go and get checked out.

It should be the baby's welfare that needs to be taken into consideration before anything else. I suggest that the mother seek help regarding  addiction.|`|qCe9Pnlgaa	I totally agree, you two need to call CPS immediatly and report her. They need to drug test her and if she's positive, they need to remove the baby from her care and give her to dad. The only thing is, dad will probably get tested too, because you KNOW mom is going to say he's just as guilty.|`|8iaCr4Vxaa	You and your brother needs to call the CPS hot-line immediately.  Was the mom doing drugs while she was pregnant?  If so she and/or the baby would have tested positive.  Take action, don't wait|`|X6as2nOAaa	If the mother is doing drugs then you need to call her in to cps or the cops and yoour brother (the father) should/might depending on if he does them too, he will get custody of the child.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	I agree call the CPS or Cops and they will file a report then he needs to talk to a lawyer.

7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	With a low dose....yes.  Very yes.  Even 4 hours can cause spotting.  Which means the hormone is no longer in your blood, and you can release an egg.<br>  <br>  With older BCP, not so much, as the hormones are much much higher in them.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I don't think you need to be concerned I have had that before, yes there is a higher risk if at different times, but that doesn't mean you will get pregnant.|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	You are best off taking it before you brush your teeth while getting ready for bed at night time.

prqrQcd1aa	I'm crying right now because of reading all of this.. It is normal to feel these ways about things. Honestly it is. You have resentment towards her because she is no longer around, and several other reasons. It's all part of the grieving process.<br>  You need to be able to "feel" all of this and just let it all out, don't hold it in, don't hold back with your feelings. <br>  I'm going through something like what you are only it's made national headlines...maybe world, My old friend didn't commit suicide but was murdered by a child. I'm very sad but I allow those feeling to come out.<br>  I'm confused as hell about what should happen to the little kid that did it to her, what I want to happen to him, the law in our state won't allow (no, i don't want him dead, or spending life in prison).<br>  The best thing i can tell you is just allow yourself to go through all the pain and don't hold it inside of you!|`|LwbwMFX9aa	yes its normal to feel resentment, suicide is a very selfish act.<br>  <br>  the crying will come when you forgive her for what she did to everyone around her and you<br>  <br>  ((( HUGS )))<br>  <br>  always know that someone loves you so there's no need for suicide

AA12380526	Well now that you're pregnant, you can forget about excitement.  Once the kid pops out, there won't be any time for fun either.  You'll have a child to raise 24/7.  It will be a full-time job for at least 18 years.  No benefits, vacation or pay raise either.  <br>  <br>  If you do all those things that you say, how can you be bored?  What else do you want to do? Skydiving? How about taking some parenting classes?|`|X6as2nOAaa	I hated doing that, I was so bored. Maybe you could volunteer doing something like walking some dogs or something? I was really bored and had nothing to do as well. I would go to my mom's or my sisters, I would do crafts and stuff like that.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I'm 28, and just got laid off because the company I work for closed.

I also bake cookies for my husband's work and I like to try out new recipes.|`|8fw3zE3gaa	Sounds like you are doing lots of fun stuff. You need to get ready to give birth walking staying active swimming is good but walking I swear by it. I walked a lot all during my pregnancy up till the day I had her and my labour was smooth and only 8 hours. SLEEP! Get as much sleep as you can sleep in till 1:00 . Enjoy that oh I miss sleeping 9 hours straight. <br>  <br>  Enjoy you pre baby time. Sorry you can't do exciting things when you are pregnant. Take a little weekend vacation to some different place fun. <br>  <br>  Sleep as much as you can do it for all us new moms.<br>  <br>  <br>  Omg another person did fish keeping. I already had a tank but got realy into it when I was pregnant. Fish keeping can be a great hobby I still love it and I'm addicted now.|`|TGzOrftPaa	I was unable to work, also due to medical reasons!  I got my baby's nursery ready and started a scrapbook.  You know those baby books you can buy?  Instead of buying one premade, make your own!  It's a good hobby (it'll keep you very entertained) and it'll make your baby book unique.  I think it's fun.  Check out a couple of baby books in the store and get some ideas from them.  You can get a package of materials to start the book for pretty cheap; not much more than you'd pay for a premade book!  It's so much fun; I can do it for hours!|`|Zi6Fr49Laa	Take on a difficult hobby, like starting a saltwater aquarium. It's pretty hard to build an ecosystem like that without killing the fish and plants. A LOT goes into it, yet you never have to clean saltwater aquariums because that environment naturally cleans itself. I looked into adopting a rescued puppy when I was earlier into my pregnancy, but you're too far along. A puppy would get jealous when the baby arrives at this point, plus you'll be too busy. Look into the aquarium thing or another hobby that could easily take a backseat to the baby here in a few weeks.|`|8zdPI8Qsaa	I didn't work for the majority of my pregnancy either, but I still felt really busy throughout the day. Cleaning the house & taking little breaks here & there took up most of my day, but every week I'd try to have a new 'project' that involved sorting through closets, reorganizing, etc. I spent way too much time perfecting everything in the baby's room too :-)|`|Ve0Wl3QNaa	I was the same way! I am also 18 and I just had my son, he is 7 months now. I was sooo bored throughout the entire pregnancy. Maybe try getting the babies room ready. You can't paint but you can pick out the theme and stuff. Maybe take up knitting or crocheting. Make the baby little booties and blankets. Congratulations.|`|PA11NoYDaa	I was in your situation when I was pregnant with my first son. I was 19 and had no car no phone no cable no internet nothing.

AA10332192	While hard to believe, a fever at that level in a baby is not an emergency.<br>  <br>  You are doing exactly the right thing.  Regular dosing of the proper amount of Infant's Tylenol.  And hydration.<br>  <br>  I do not even suggest the baths, as that can cause more temperature stress.  Babies do not react the same way as adults for fevers and naturally run warmer.  100 in an infant is not considered a fever.<br>  <br>  So, this is the American Pediatric Guideline.<br>  Less than 3 months old. Call your doctor right away if your baby's temperature goes over 100.4°F rectally, even if he or she doesn't seem sick. Babies this young can get very sick very quickly.<br>  <br>  Three to 6 months old. Call your doctor if your baby has a temperature of 101°F or higher (even if your baby doesn't seem sick).<br>  <br>  Six months and older. If your child has a fever of 102°F, watch how he or she acts. Call your doctor if the fever rises or lasts for more than 3 days. In children 3 months to 2 years of age, if the temperature is 103°F, call your doctor even if your child seems to feel fine.<br>  <br>  Your doctor's limit of 104 while at the upper most limit, is acceptable.  The bigger issues are as follows:<br>  <br>  Lethargy and lasting more than 3 days.  Those should be seen immediately.<br>  <br>  But save your strength and sanity and just soothe your little one and wait for the next Tylenol dose.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	go on to the hospital , better safe than sorry; it could spike really high on you....depending on the cause of it...gl|`|eZDoQPg8aa	Well, I don't agree that it's nothing to worry about.  I hate it when doctors get patronizing!<br>  <br>  Anyhow, if the temp is 102 with tylenol, I think something is going on that needs to be checked out.  It if was 102 without the medication, then I'd say give her some and wait and see what happens.<br>  <br>  It's totally up to you but waiting times in hospitals can be terribly long and having a sick and very unhappy baby to try to keep consoling makes for a difficult experience.  Try calling the ER department before you go and see how busy they are (if they will tell you).  The later you wait, the more bizarre it tends to get on a weekend night.|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	give her only motrin - tylenol is useless; motrin works best and longest, so if you give medication to your baby, you might as well give something that works.. and one more piece of advice - don't listen to the doctor.. doctor has 100 babies as patients and you have only one.. whatever doctor might come up with through a series of tests and "just wait and see"s, you will be feeling because you are the baby's mother..|`|CzKrqgmgaa	The nurses at our hospital told me that if you are ever in doubt its best to bring baby up and have her checked out. If it were me I'd bring her up... if you've tried everything else then thats your last option. If nothing else it will just put your mind at ease. That is what doctors and nurses are there for... to check and see if everything is ok when Mom and Dad aren't sure.<br>  <br>  Add - we live in a very small town and its rare that there are more than 2 or 3 patients in our ER at any time|`|UxG6CkU2aa	You have already done everything that you're supposed to do, Good Job Mom! I would just keep an eye on her temp and make sure it doesn't get too high. Keep her hydrated, and just watch how she is acting, if she seems lethargic I would take her to the hospital asap, but otherwise she will be fine. A little bit of a fever is a good thing when you are sick, it helps fight off the infection. That is why are body temperature rises when we are sick, it is a natural thing. That is how I look at it when my kids are sick, so I don't worry so much.<br>  You are doing everything right, so just trust your motherly instinct.|`|kgE96Nhcaa	You can alternate Infant's Motrin with Infant's Tylenol, just not for long periods of time.  You can try to give a dose of Motrin, just make sure they aren't given within two hours of each other is the general rule.  <br>  FYI if you take her into the hospital with what sounds like a virus she may very well leave with strep and all sorts of other "goodies" during flu season try to avoid unnecessary trips to the ER and MD.<br>  Many times with a high fever it is viral not bacterial.  You have to watch her diaper output and make sure she is still wetting.  If she isn't tolerating formula, try watering it down or giving Pedialyte<br>  Hope this helps, please don't take your child to the ER unless YOUR MD wants you to, for now listen to them.  Babies are so susceptible, and don't have the immune system to fight all the germs at the ER and you will end up having a bigger and longer mess on your hands.   You can also put cool (Not Freezing) face cloths under her arm pits, behind her neck and on her forehead and cover her with a light sheet.|`|132a94967b26774746922b6b7c03bf49aa	Fever is scary, but you are doing all the right things.  It is hard to watch your baby feel bad and you can't do anything make it stop.  Remember that fever is a natural process  Your baby's body is doing what it is supposed to do  When the temperature goes up by a few degrees it gives the human body the winning edge over the infection. Fever activates the body’s immune system to produce more white blood cells, antibodies, and other agents that fight infection.<br>  <br>  Keep doing what you are doing and call your doctor if she gets worse  It's hard to be a Mum - but you're doing fine  Take a deep breath and have a cup of tea.|`|2LmfQUbKaa	it is realy the question of how long has she had it? if it has been more then two days and you know it isnt from teething i would take her in keep an eye on the fever if you see any changes in her like rashes or she dont want to do anything or not going p. like she is suppose to get her to the hospital my son was 4-5 mnths old and had a fever for 2 days straight nothing worked and the doctor i had was a real work of art she didnt care so i followed my gut! i took him to childrens hospital and thank god i did! they had to do a spinal but what ever it was the hospital got the fever to go down! and he was ok but you have to follow your gut the dr. well it isnt his baby! you know whaT I MEAN! GOOD LUCK TO YOU!

I think that by the way she is coming back to YOU that means that she respects you and feels safe with you!! I think that you need to help her and tell her that selling herself is not okay!!

ZOA3VnRpaa	you could be pregnant possibly or your body is just changing it's ways|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	im 21 days late!  but hpt and blood test say negative.  and I totally felt like I was pregnant with tonnes of symptoms. I am very regular too.  There are many things that can delay a period including stress of trying to conceive and wanting to be pregnant.   when trying to conceive you should always kinda treat your body like you are already pregnant, with eating healthy and vitamins and folic acid..  so go ahead and test at home and if not pregnant, wait a week test again and if still no period and not getting positives then go in to doctor for blood work to confirm things.  if no period and no prengancy generally it seems doctors want you to wait a full cycle and two missed periods before they want to investigate.  as weird as it seems you can apparently miss a period for no reason and its okay despite being regular normally.    hopefully things will work out in your favor sooner rather than later.  * baby dust *|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Could just be the stress of trying to conceive.|`|boF5DmeAaa	HON is go get like a prgnancy test and than ask your doctor and if it says pregnant than go to the doc also and if it gets really baad like you feel like your gonna pass out call the squad.

Try to relax as stressing may delay your period.|`|w7p9EiIxaa	It sounds kind of serious. Don't freak out because I'm no expert but if you're worried about it, you may want to ask your doctor. I've only had mine for like half a year. But I missed it once. And the month before that I had only the smallest amount of blood. I still had the cramps and even a little bloating but yeah.

You can't justify whatever your feeling at the present with those drastic actions.If you leave,you'll continue doing that for the rest of your life. Every time you're in a tight situation or there is trouble,you'll run away as fast as you can and it'll keep on following you as fast.You have to deal with it face on.Tackle hard.Communications open.Compromise.<br>  Okay?|`|hfodUPg9aa	A book.

Y8ZmuWwgaa	This is hard because I actually love both. I think between the two, though, I'll go with Aurora.

Also, Aurora means "dawn" in Latin, which is a favorite image of mine and is what I always associate the name with.|`|CKRJwsZoaa	Definitely Maeve.

Don't cross borders states/canada and go far enough away so no one recognizes you <br>  <br>  4. Are you going to tell someone, leave a note or something? I would tell a friend where you are going and some details and keep in touch with them so they know if you got killed or mugged or something. Also they will be able to send you money or something if you need it.<br>  <br>  5. Bring enough stuff with you that you will not have to go into a store or anything anytime soon because they will catch you on camera.<br>  <br>  6.

Dangerous huh ?<br>  <br>  Once she decided to come home the whole incident was not forgotten. The police were involved, social services were and still are involved, she got referred to counselors and psychiatrists,I stopped trusting he, her freedom became limited. <br>  <br>  She has never ran away since so it couldn't have been a particularly fun experience aye ?<br>  <br>  All I'm saying is think about what you are doing. Think about the effect it will have on the people that love you. Your parents, siblings, friends. When someone you love runs away, it's scary. Your family and friends will worry about you. They will automatically assume the worst. Do they deserve to go trough all that pain ? <br>  <br>  There are alternatives to running away you know. Problems can be resolved.

xy5UNiELaa	Your immune system is weaker when you're pregnant.  On top of stress and the weather, you're bound to get sick every now and then.  The ear infection is probably secondary to the cold, not two seperate incidents.  Have you seen the doc?  The ear infection def. should be treated to insure it doesn't get worse and spreads.|`|Vi5SCyr9aa	it can be normal, i had a constant sinus infection with my second pregnancy|`|qJaKF24naa	Aww I am sorry to hear that. I know I keep getting small colds and stuffy noses and stuff but I think it is normal. I think it makes it worse because we cannot really take any medicine so takes longer to get out of our systems. Hope you feel better. My sister in law was sick through her whole entire pregnancy, so I hope that doesn turn out to be your case! Just relax a little I am sure the stress is not helping out but probably is not the toal cause of it.|`|plI0WOrUaa	Your body is working so hard at making your little baby that you are more susceptible to getting sick. Don't worry it happens to many people.  Just get your rest as much as you can to give your body the energy to fight off all those germs that seem to love you!|`|4p9sBdyTaa	Actually getting sick a lot during pregnancy is common due to the fact that your immune system lowers during pregnancy so your body doesn't reject the baby.

Stinks, I know. Just keep taking your prenatal vitamins and wash your hands frequently. Right now you need to do all you can to keep the baby healthy. Because from now on, your needs come second...for, what, at least the next 18 years or so? Good luck!

If you name her Evangeline, her nick name would be Eva, so you would have Eva and Ava.|`|rdGQMSyjaa	I like all the boys names, but since I have to pick....GABRIEL.<br>  <br>  I don't dislike any of the girls names either.

oXIYHsDaaa	try using a higher flow nipple on her bottle, my daughter is breast fed but I know she scratches at me when the milk flow slows down, and I've heard other breast feeding mom's complain about the same thing it might be an Instinct thing to try and increase the milk flow. (I know it sounds kind of stupid but kittens do the same thing when they nurse)<br>  <br>  If all else fails you can always put mittens or socks on her hands while she's eating.|`|vEobDY1haa	my baby does this too, but when im breastfeeding. :( i look like I got scratched by a cat.<br>  <br>  I got her to stop by holding her hands while she was feeding, or swaddling her. She stopped soon after that. If your baby doesn't stop, just put lil baby gloves on her.|`|51jVOdq5aa	Make sure you cut her nails and file it atleast twice a week. My son usually scratches his face and would get cuts so i make sure his nails are always short. I wouldnt recommend the frequent use of mittens on babies for the reason that it prevents motion and flexibility on the fingers and hinders digits of the hands to exercise better. Also, this would prevent the hands from always making a fist that would eventually require theraphy.|`|OhgfDmJAaa	Try and loosen the bottle top to release a faster flow and try buying a bottle that has handles and encourage her to hold her own bottle you can still assist her, but it can help to keep her little hands busy.. good luck|`|2LmfQUbKaa	she is soooo cute! ya that is normal you can put on her some socks over her hands or go to your local dollar store and get her those little hand mitts they are realy good for that!|`|S1H8B23Iaa	My son does this too and i put those mittens on his hand while i feed him and when he goes to bed just in case although i do keep his nails trimmed well.. i think|`|oxxbjM2taa	try to put little gloves on her so she cant hurt her self [;
be5076c0b98b495ffe00aade08f96b65aa	Yes, but neither stress nor jumping will cause it. If the baby needs to have a bowel movement, it will. It's not as serious as some people say it is. I mean they will be able to tell when your water breaks. The fluid will be a green,yellow, or brown color. If your water breaks at home this is something to look for, so you can let them know. If they break your water at the hospital, they will automatically look for it, and have a pediatric team in the delivery room as a precaution. As long as the baby doesn't aspirate (breathe it into it's lungs), there's no harm. If it does aspirate, then complications could arise. Don't stress over that though. <br>  <br>  FYI, you will not know if the stomach had a bowel movement. Your stomach won't hurt because of it. Maybe you just have a touch of the flu, it's going around.|`|AA12000741	yes that can still happen i would go to the hospital they will give you a stress test and make sure the baby is okay...4 hrs is a long time to still be in pain...just the pain could be bad on the baby....usually the baby doesnt poop in you until birth and thats only by putting a lot of stress on it when pushing...that prolly hasnt happened but i would go in and make sure the baby is okay..<br>  <br>  good luck|`|yKS2UI87aa	Not very likely I would have to say 1 in a million. IF the baby does, they are usu. overdue like my son was. Your tummy hurts b/c of the running etc.|`|A5p9g4tMaa	yes it is called caloploma and it can happen at 24 weeks.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Babies don't poop until the VERY end if at all.|`|E7R7D1onaa	if you are hurting u should rest with ur feet up that will give u some relief
Boubyng3aa	Im not sure how much it cost, but it should be covered by insurance. My husbands insurance is really strict on what they cover, and they paid for my blood test. Best of luck|`|yKS2UI87aa	Should be covered by your insurance.|`|0IFBS2iQaa	healthquotes.awardspace.info - here is my health insurance plan. As I remember they can provide such a service.
qJaKF24naa	Wow that baby really doesnt want to come out! I am sorry. I would just walking a lot and having sex to try and help induce it, sounds like hes coming when he wants and that is very clear already.|`|aMlWMkO5aa	Try more walking. Why no castor oil? I was due with my boy on May 6th on May 7th I took castor oil and on May 8th he was born. Might have been a coincidence, but it wasn't that bad.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	oh honey! I feel for you I really do! You listed walking and sex as a 'no' lol. The only things left are wives tales! Pinapple and spicy food is all I know|`|2P5WRadhaa	Relax! The laws of nature will prevail..."An apple won't fall off the tree til its ripe and ready. Pinpointing the exact delivery time is a guesstimate, at best. It'll be on time; in its own time!|`|vnFAAJ0Qaa	maybe you aren't overdue...due dates are just an approximation. the due date is based on the baby's size and different things could cause an older baby to be smaller than average leading the dr to the wrong conception date....I was induced and really it was a great experience..you don't have to worry about when it is happening you know that when you go into the hospital you are leaving with your baby. Most of the time labor is induced with a drug but when I arrived that morning i was dilated to 3cm and my Dr used a hook broke my water and 8hr later I had my baby in my arms. I don't feel at all that my induction was a bad thing because I was surrounded by people I trusted the ENTIRE thing.|`|wqqY6rjFaa	i know how you feel your probably miserable and ready for him to come out when i was 34 weeks i was dialated 2 and 90 thinned and the doctor could feel my water bout to break and i didnt have her til 3 days before my due date my water finally broke i would just keep walking stay very active..my friend tryed castrol oil and it worked but i wouldnt try it..being induced isnt that bad even after my water broke after bout 6 hours they have me medicine to induce my contractions more so either way youll be just fine|`|smcWIZxPaa	I was induced.  It isn't the greatest experience ever.  I had a lot of pain and a really hard labor then a c-section.  My labor had complications though so dont worry about that.  I tried everything to get my son out.  I walked MILES and MILES and tried sex, running, swimming, anything physical, spicy foods, pretty much all the old wives tales.  Nothing worked.  I was due sept 8th and had my baby boy on sept 17th.|`|0NX1vnSKaa	you've done all you can do. if the baby doesn't want to come on its own, you'll have to be induced.<br>  it's not that bad being induced. it actually speeds up delivery time. i was induced and i was only in labor for 4 1/2 hrs. its was awesome. the only thing is that contractions are stronger with induced labor, but epidurals take care of that just fine :)|`|nyuB4POqaa	I went into labour minutes after a hott bath<br>  good luck hun, he'll be here eventually|`|3cLE5L7Saa	OH MY GOD I KNOW!!!! I wouldn't let my doc sweep my membranes today, because it doesn't even work all the time, as you know.  I've tried walking and my bf is in a different state so I can't have sex, and I won't try castor oil either.  I had my friend drive me on bumpy roads for a while, and I ate a whole pineapple and NOTHING HAS WORKED....Mabye he'll come this weekend! I'm getting induced the same day as you too! Its so frustrating and in the meantime you know he could come at ANY second, so I'm all paranoid.  My doc said induction won't be that bad.  Just that the contractions will be a bit stronger, but I'm getting an epidural soooo....yeah, the way they explained it, i'm not really worried.  Good luck with delivery mamma! :)|`|b0e9ea8aa843686326e2afbe57d49ddaaa	Just keep walking , as much as you can !!<br>  I was induced with my first baby and it wasn't really that bad, the contractions  are a little stronger but not too bad if you take the epidural you will be fine.<br>  Good Luck:)

But I remember hearing my girls heart beat it was awesome. I was so happy the whole day.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	It's an old wive's tale|`|FUNhlpiqaa	It was for me!!!  3 girls and 1 boy.  Congratulations, it's so sweet!|`|JuWL7T0Haa	I don't think that is true but my little girls was usually about 150 so maybe :)|`|yrF1q1mdaa	yeah that's how the tale goes but it wasn't true with me. my little one's heart beat is over 140 and he's definitely a boy!|`|EtEn5JClaa	have no idea|`|3e42dfd404c2e6e75af7d0c190d10b2aaa	nope. sure isn't.

Now she is at 158bpm. Go figure!
1JbdCRdtaa	OK TMI coming up but this is a sure fire way to know that you are ovulating!<br>  <br>  First of all you have to check your cervical mucous  ( i know gross)  When you are ovulating there is a ton and it's stretchy like egg whites. (gross again)  Secondly if you really want to know you can start checking your cervix. What you would do is use your pointer finger to feel your cervix. When you are not ovulating the cervix is closed and hard (like the tip of a nose) when you are ovulating the cervix goes high up, softens and a hole opens up to let the sperm swim up. It's actually quite fascinating.  You can go to ovusoft.com and it will teach you how to really check if your interested.  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  Hayley|`|cfe02e6ae5ad9f610e0881cb2edcb2cfaa	If you keep track of your discharge you should be able to tell when you are ovulating. When it's clear and really stretchy is the best time. The internet documents this well. Some websites even have pictures showing you the difference. Good luck!
j01zBZmZaa	Sounds totally gross, I know, but when your vaginal discharge is really sticky and stretchy you're ovulating. Get a little fluid between your fingers and pull. The closer you get to ovulation, the farther it will stretch before breaking. Good luck!|`|AA12327015	You have an 8mo old and you already want to get pregnant again? <br>  Try an ovulation predictor at the drugstore. If you aren't having a period then you're not ovulating. Are you breastfeeding? If so, most likely you're not ovulating.

oHNrktxTaa	Yes, you are right. Both premenstrual & pregnancy symptoms are very similar to each other. However, everyone is different.<br>  <br>  Constipation is also an early sign. It could also be from prenatal vitamins (if you are on any). <br>  Most of the symptoms that you are having are early signs of pregnancy.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|rQJLU2ndaa	I had and still have fatigue like I have never felt before. I hope you get your BFP!!!!!!! Good Luck!!!! I will say a prayer for you!!|`|6ebc3QuFaa	Before you begin to get prepared, you need to know first if you are already pregnant. Most women use as an early sign of pregnancy as the first missing period when this symptom could be associated to other disorders sometimes or metabolism adjusting to increasing needs or hormonal changes. Some women can even have menstrual periods clear up to the six month of pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Some other symptoms of early pregnancy help women to know they are pregnant as well as home pregnancy test to find out, but other signs let you guess it in advance. Morning sickness and sudden fatigue may be the first manifestations of pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Your body increases the level of the hormone progesterone as it adapts to pregnancy, which makes you feel tired. This is a temporary condition that usually passes away during the second trimester of pregnancy with intermittent episodes coming back on the third.<br>  <br>  Another sign that may be observed is in your breast, becoming more tender, swollen and sensitive because the increasing levels of hormones during this stage making you feel discomfort until during the first trimester while your body adjusts to pregnancy hormonal changes.<br>  <br>  Other symptoms include nausea or vomiting, food aversions, increased sensitivity to odors, frequent urination, higher body temperature than usual and of course the missed period.<br>  <br>  If you do not keep track of your menstrual cycle, or it is irregular, varying from one month to another, these signs will help you out if your symptoms are associated with upcoming motherhood.|`|wnQRhfczaa	I had similar symptoms - especially overwhelming tiredness at about 3 pm and also cramping - I felt like I had been doing sit ups!<br>  <br>  However, I also had the exact same symptoms the previous 2 months when I was not pregnant. It is so difficult to tell - wait until you miss your period and then test - don't stress yourself out over it because it can be devastating if you convince yourself you are pregnant and it turns out you're not.

iKPSOMiSaa	i really think your just earlier than you thought. that same thing happened to me. i went to the dr thinking i was 8 weeks and i was only 5 1/2. i worried to death but when i went back 2 weeks later, there was a heartbeat and a very small baby. but before that my u/s looked just like yours. just really a sac and no visable baby yet. try not to worry and im sure its fine.|`|xq7S9H5Raa	If it is 6 weeks then it explains why there is no heartbeat.  Ask them to repeat it in 2 more weeks.|`|plI0WOrUaa	around 6 weeks.  the picture is small, but i see something in there for sure.  It would be the yolk sac for sure, which turns into the baby.  There wouldn't be a heartbeat yet.  No heart yet for that matter.  Don't worry, you'll get your hgc's done and everything will be fine.|`|Cxdxo393aa	same thing happened to me except i was 5 weeks and they didnt see anything except for the sack i went back when i was 7 weeks and saw the baby and its heart beat (although it just looked like a bean)|`|yKS2UI87aa	Well, LMP is not accurate and you should be about 1-2 weeks behind that. You don't ovulate until 7-14 days after your period which is when the sperm would meet the egg and you would be preg. then.|`|umca7pwoaa	I'm not sure about the date based on LMP but I thought I could offer some words that may make you feel better.<br>  <br>  At 7w4d they did an ultrasound and only seen the sac and was concerned because they wanted to see a fetal pole/development. I went back in a week for a repeat and sure enough there was the heartbeat. Turns out my period wasn't accurate or my ovulation was off. Either way, i'm currently 21 weeks 6 days pregnant...<br>  <br>  Best wishes on your pregnancy. Yours could just be off like mine, the lab work should clear it up. IF the HCG's keep going up (and they should go up fast) then you're in the same shape I was in.|`|nyuB4POqaa	6 weeks is right according to your LMP, and that is most accurate thing to go by<br>  <br>  I can't really see the u/s pic very well, it's really small
5ORyLk4Uaa	your baby does not get a heart beat until sometime during the 6th week of pregnancy. according to your ovulation time you are about 6 weeks along so yes you are having a normal pregnancy. some spotting in early stages of pregnancy is normal exspecially around your period time. i did with my oldest. yes your baby will look like a little bean for now. congrats and have a healthy happy pregnancy.|`|Cxdxo393aa	same answers as last time. people arent going to change their answers for you.  YOU NEED TO GO BACK TO THE DOCTORS.  theres no way to tell exactly when you conceived until they see a zygote and can meaure it.  go back in 2 weeks, as suggested before.

I fill the cup about 1/2 full and put it in the microwave for 1 minute (you need to test for the right time). Then, I pull it out and put the bottle into the cup. It is the quickest way that we have found to heat bottles, and if you find just the right amount of time for the water to be in the microwave, you don't have to worry about overheating, which can be a problem if you are boiling water.

If you wait untill the 2nd it will be to late. Just make sure you start counting on the first day of full red flow not just spotting. I would also recomend taking it at nite, to help with side effects, and to start OPKs if you are not being monitored on cd 9, and make sure and have sex on cd 11-19 atleast every other day.|`|2f6diQBiaa	I would definitely take it Feb 28th.

be5076c0b98b495ffe00aade08f96b65aa	I doubt it. If you bled for almost a full week with the first period, then you had a period. It also means that when you had sex, you weren't ovulating.<br>  <br>  The early period may just be your body's way of making sure your clean. Sometimes excess blood builds up within the uterus, and because the uterus needs to expel it, it does so a little early. Don't be alarmed if you don't get a period for March, or if you get it, and it only lasts a few days or is really light. You could always take a test to make sure, but I am sure it will be negative.|`|Qk8VQukpaa	if your first period came on time i dont think you have anything to worry about...you might be stressed out causing you to have the second period or your cycle might just be changing up...i think you should be fine tho...still test in about 2 weeks!<br>  hope this helps!|`|CPPBqVaaaa	u are okay bc u got your period a week later.. so a week b4 u had sex u ovulated.. u can only get pregnant on the day u ovulate.. u are fine..|`|soFpywFcaa	if you had your period then your not pregnant....dont stress.if you stress it will make weird things happen to your body......take a hpt just to be safe|`|iE1E0YWSaa	Your period would usually indicate that you are not pregnant, however some women do bleed, while pregnant; this is called 'spotting'. In your case, it is more likely that you are experiencing cramps and bloating. This could be why you feel as though your stomach is growing. If you are worried that you may be pregnant you should still get tested; anomalies are always a possibility. You can always go to a free teen clinic for a pregnancy test.

xvxT46iJaa	Pros:<br>  A woman has a right to choose when it comes to things that affect her body.<br>  If you are unable to afford a child<br>  If you don't want a child<br>  If you are unable to go through with a pregnancy (for medical or psychological reasons)<br>  If your pregnancy is the result of rape<br>  If you pregnancy is the result of incest<br>  If you don't want to go through a pregnancy, and give up your child.<br>  If you don't want to force tax payers to pay for your mistake for the next 18 years.<br>  <br>  In my opinion though, the most important pro, is that continuing with a pregnancy has a massive impact on a woman's life, and it's not right that she should be forced into having a baby when she doesn't want to. It's not the government's body, or the fundamentalist's body, therefore it shouldn't be their decision. That is the reason i am pro choice.<br>  <br>  Another point i would like to bring up is that just because a person is pro-choice, does not mean they would choose to have an abortion if they got unexpectedly pregnant. It means that we believe that if a woman wants to have an abortion, she should be able to. It also does not mean that we hate babies and never want children, and it would be nice if those who are against abortion could realise that.|`|aOCfLAJJaa	It's murder.<br>  <br>  There are no pros.|`|wnkoTEqVaa	i am pro choice because it is a womens body and she can do what she wants. We are talking about a clump of cells not an actual child. The baby becomes a child at 6 1/2 months in the womb that is when it can live outside if need be. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/L-abortiontrauma.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/L-abortion...</a><br>  this is for people who think that more women suffer depression after the abortion. Most women do not feel depression but relief <br>  Also what about people who were raped or having a baby might kill him.|`|ScHW4842aa	I would only abort under the condition that the child would have a genetic or other abnormality. <br>  <br>  I saw a video on abortion. I am not sure how many weeks - but the surgeon suctioned out the baby, held onto it by its feet and broke its neck with those sisscor things they operate with. It was disgusting. <br>  <br>  I think abortion, unless for medical reasons, should only be allowed upto 6 weeks in gestation. Then, there is a heartbeat and ITS A CHILD.|`|N24wkFROaa	I've never been in the situation where I've had to chose to have an abortion, but I don't want children ever (I know that sounds bad and I'm only 13 but I don't..)<br>  <br>  So if I did get pregnant I would probably have one, even though it is cruel.<br>  <br>  But it's even more cruel to bring a child into the world where it isn't wanted.. isn't it?<br>  <br>  Oh wait my answer wasn't to the question it was more my views haha!|`|6L9jJnchaa	Pros:  Teenagers make stupid mistakes and them having more kids when they can't support them puts more strain on the government, and their parents to support the kids.|`|IspdMaRLaa	There are no pros to abortion. It's murder.|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	Pros:<br>  - No financial strains<br>  - No emotional dilemma of dealing with unwanted/unplanned baby<br>  - If raped, then the baggage of a baby isn't stuck with you for life<br>  - If young, then you have a chance to live life and finish education<br>  - Ultimately she is the one who would be going through the actual "Labor" of continuing pregnancy, delivering a baby, bringing it up, parenting it well, in addition to other obligations she has to do in her daily life. To get it done with little or no help from the partner and families needs a well-balanced body and mind.<br>  - While we argue about the mental well being of a woman, how do others get to decide what would be more traumatic to the woman, abortion or childbirth and the unending list of duties waiting to be accomplished.<br>  - An attempt to restrict the abortions would rise not only the percentage of illegal and unsafe abortions but also the expenses of the procedure. A new law would be needed to tackle the illegal abortions and further legal hassles would have no ends.<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  - Can be dangerous to woman's body<br>  - Killing a life by having abortion<br>  - Most of unplanned pregnancies if extended to childbirth may prove to be wanted later.<br>  - A growing embryo is considered human with the heartbeats initiating as early as 21st day of conception. So what if we cannot see the human form, it does have the potential to gain one.<br>  - Should people opt for abortion as last-minute contraception when preaching their kids about the consequences of casual sex?<br>   - Infection, sepsis, recurrent miscarriages and rarely death could be the complications of abortions.<br>  - Abortions can cause serious psychological impairment to the woman in the form of depression and guilt.|`|drI1vsJdaa	PROS<br>  You're not pregnant anymore.<br>  If you can't afford it, you don't have to have it anymore and can go get one after the other *YIPPEE!* (sarcasm!)<br>  <br>  CONS<br>  9 out of 10 mothers experience guilt and feel very badly about it.<br>  It kills a baby.<br>  If the FOCA happens, everyone will have to pay for it.<br>  You might not be able to have children later.|`|vp1K0bxwaa	That's ridiculous.<br>  <br>  People are for it because why should women be told what to do with our bodies?<br>  <br>  I'm for it because of the following situations:<br>  <br>  Rape<br>  Incest<br>  Mother's illness<br>  Child would be horribly disfigured<br>  Cannot afford a child<br>  <br>  Yes adoption is an option to getting rid of your child, but there are SO MANY children in foster homes/ adoption homes already, why should we add more?|`|hko5rrVoaa	Abortion Sucks!

It isn't something that should be argued by a list of pros and cons. There aren't any pros. Not to say I'm against it but it isn't something that anyone can feel good about. The only good thing about  it is that it's an option for victims of pregnancy caused by incest,  rape, or teenage pregnancy. Unfortunately there are many irresponsible adults who have unprotected sex and rush to the abortion clinic to get rid of the evidence like it's no big deal. It's a nightmare.|`|ikpKEqIlaa	I had an abortion yesterday. I think it's a very personal decision. Prior to having it, I was the kind of person who was always against abortion, but then I found out I was pregnant. My boyfriend (who didn't push me to have the abortion) made it clear that if I had the baby, I'd be raising him or her on my own. I'm already a single mom of 2, and I felt having this baby would be irresponsible. My 2 kids that I've struggled financially and emotionally to take care of, would struggle more if I had chosen to keep this baby. I wouldn't have been able to take care of them financially or physically and work full-time if I had chosen to continue with the pregnancy. My decision was not selfish, I wanted that baby, but I did this for my kids, because it was the responsible thing to do.<br>  <br>  Is killing a baby wrong? absolutely! But this was not a BABY! I was 5 weeks pregnant. I saw the ultrasound, they had to do a vaginal ultrasound b/c they couldn't see anything from the regular ultrasound (that rubbed on your stomach). Even from the vaginal ultrasound, all you could see was this small empty black space (this was the sac), you couldn't even see the fetus, it was literally smaller than a pin prick. Yes, I know it had a heartbeat, but so does a spider and I'm sure you've killed a spider before. A spider is probably 1000 times bigger than this fetus was.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying I agree with abortion in every situation. My boyfriend knows this woman who over the years has had a total of 6 abortions; I think someone like that should be sterilized! But I think each situation is different and every woman has the right to choose what's best for her situation|`|tBtOTiQDaa	there are no pros to murder<br>  the cons are infinate
dDVAUA9saa	I think you need to listen to your body and do what you feel like doing.  This is my second pregnancy, I'm 24 weeks and have been sick with one thing or another since day one.  I have worked out a bit in between illnesses, but same thing.  I'm so tired it's very difficult.  I also have a toddler at home and work full time. <br>  <br>  When I was pregnant with my first, I exercised ALL THE TIME!  I did aerobics, aquafit, stationary cycling, elliptical, ran at the beginning and later walked on the treadmill.  I felt great and was never sick.  This pregnancy has just been much more difficult.  I'm really hoping to get back to things after i have this baby.  We'll see!|`|ddP3klT3aa	When I was pregnant I worked 5 days a week until I was 7-8 months. I was on my feet all day. I didn't have time to be tired. That's exercise..brisk walking.|`|TVx4iWlGaa	I never worked out either time I was pregnant. I seriously mean NEVER. The extent of my exercise was going to the store... I also ate anything and everything I wanted. Both my girls are healthy, Im healthy and back to my pre-baby weight. I only gained 25-30lbs during both pregnancies and Im back to my normal 120lbs. I dont think you need to exercise unless you want to.|`|ldyKSejgaa	Exercise is always healthy and being pregnant is not going to be an exception to the rule, but depending on your specific needs, the type and amount of exercise will need to be adjusted decreasing exercise performance to satisfy the diverse physiologic and lifestyle changes associated with pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Your Doctor will review your actual exercising routine if any, and will advise the avoidance of the following activities that may result in potential harm to your baby and risky for you even if you are healthy.<br>  <br>  Downhill skiing, parachute jumping, roller blading, skateboarding, horseback riding, off-road biking, weight lifting, high impact aerobics, high altitude training, contact sports, scuba-diving, kayaking, surfing, water-skiing and most water sports except swimming.<br>  <br>  Regular exercise requiring you to lie flat on your back is risky particularly after the first trimester because studies have demonstrated that most pregnant women show decreased cardiac output even with low impact exercises so the problem is the position.<br>  <br>  Those considered non-weight-bearing exercises are not only recommended but benefit women that never kept an exercise regime before pregnancy, not only minimizing the risk or injury to the developing baby but making it easier to continue exercising after giving birth.<br>  <br>  Walking, cycling and swimming are usually safe but stop if they make you feel tired and resume them gradually after getting some rest. Do not hesitate to ask your doctor if you have any questions regarding your current exercise routine and those changes or adjustments you may need to do in your program during pregnancy.
qJaKF24naa	Could be either but probably pregnant again. I would go to doctors so they can get the hormone levels and then they should be able to tell. When I miscarried though my doc had me go once a week for blood test to make sure my levels decreased because they never had to go and remove anything extra left inside.. So if you doc did that and told you you could stop I think its a new baby.  If not it could be either but more than likely new pregnancy. Congrats and good luck!|`|1gF9QVy9aa	When I had a D&C for a blighted ovum back in November of 2007, I believe I still had hcg in my system for about 3-4 weeks.  You're still within that time frame, so I'd just ask the doctor to be sure but I'm going to say it's leftover hormones from your miscarriage.  <br>  <br>  BUT, I hope for the best for you!!!  It could be a new pregnancy too!|`|BilLTGLFaa	I would think that since you're miscarriage was so recent that the Hormone levels in your body are still high. I've heard of women getting positive tests up to 6 months after a miscarriage.
vnFAAJ0Qaa	it is very possible...women get pregnant from less exposure than that...It just depends where she is in her cycle. Maybe you get lucky this time but please be more careful!|`|IFqY2w1Paa	There is a very good chance she could get pregnant from this. Have her test if she misses her period.|`|nYJEWLAlaa	yes|`|A5p9g4tMaa	it is possible but not likely women have a small window per month to get pregnant.<br>  <br>  <br>  It also depends on how far in you were/how close you were to the womb.
ml2FDYECaa	I took my son to get the same shots yesterday. It hurts to see a baby cry. My pediatrician recommended benadryl if he had an allergic reaction to any foods. For something like this I would talk to your pediatrician as soon as possible, and see if there can be an allergic reaction to any of the shots given...GL...God bless...A|`|g4mvfBQ8aa	Yeah this is normal unless she begins to not act like her normal self.  Most babies do have some irritability after vaccines and may very well be in a little pain.  I would give Tylenol only after getting how much to give first by the MD because it doesn't tell u on the box.  She should be better tomorrow but if you are worried and she is worse, call your pediatrician.  Also the site redness should also subside, but is a normal finding as well.  Hope this helps.|`|51jVOdq5aa	A lot of times that is just a normal reaction from the shot. However make sure shes not running a fever, if she does just give her a dose of tylenol every 4-6 hours and shell be fine. Normally the redness will just disappear no need to worry.|`|i8C7pvJCaa	My children did cry like they were sore after shots. Sometimes they cried, depending on the child.<br>  If it gets too bad, don't hesitate to call her doctor.|`|2LmfQUbKaa	if it keeps up and baby tylenol dont help i would take her in|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	Try some Tylenol, if she's old enough for it, and a cold compress.  If she doesn't have a fever, and is acting fine other wise, the she's probubly fine.  Shots hurt for a while after you get them done, even in adults.
wzM5WB8Xaa	I actually heard this too. My MIL tried to convince me to drink a beer when my milk didn't come in for a week after I had my daughter. I actually found that alcohol did increase my milk production, but I also pumped and dumped after I had more than one drink, because I didn't want it to get into my breastmilk. Basically, the information that I got from our public health nurses and my doctor on alcohol and breast milk is that one drink is ok, so long as you wait more than an hour after to breastfeed. If you have enough to drink that you feel drunk, you should pump and dump or wait at least 6 hours afterward to breastfeed. And, though drinking will increase your milk production in the short term, it does absolutely nothing for long term milk production.|`|8j7FCEOraa	Do you really think its a good idea to be drinking alcohol and breastfeeding at the same time? Maybe you should count your blessings that you haven't lactated yet.|`|2LmfQUbKaa	funny thats what we call my son budda but no thats not true! you could massage your breast but there are alot of women that dont have it i didnt have it in both of my births!|`|nyuB4POqaa	WOW<br>  that is absolutely the most audaciouslything i've heard all day<br>  Just drink water or milk to increase your milk production.|`|OgzHcNMsaa	I know many people who swear by guinness. I never tried because I think it taste  like tree bark but ppl say it works|`|KQF5X9Vpaa	you shouldn't be drinking and trying to breastfeed...it can harm the baby|`|51jVOdq5aa	I havent heard that beers increases milk production. You have to keep on mind that what you eat is what your baby is getting. I suggest consuming healthy foods instead and soups help a lot. Breast milk is a case of supply and demand. The more you try breastfeeding the more it will stimulate your breast to produce milk.|`|qKEKLOaEaa	No, not sure how this rumor got started.. I have heard it many times. Also, the "pump and dump" method that some women do so that they can drink while breastfeeding is B.S.. Alcohol travels through the blood stream so until it is out of your system it is still in your milk. The rule is that you should wait ATLEAST an hour before breastfeeding if you have a glass of wine or a beer. The safest way to handle this though is by not drinking at all.|`|mLUHItNWaa	its not true. wat it does it that there is an ingredient in beed called hops its a horomone. it makes ur **** bigger not more milk. thats also y boys get beer bellies. because of the hops|`|LlkdoZTeaa	guiness, has an iron content but it's not that high, and to be honest, hasnt really been proved to help as its not that high in iron<br>  <br>  taking an iron supplement is a good idea though|`|QsyMkGzAaa	You heard wrong. All you are doing is getting drunk and introducing alcohol to your baby. Well done.
WPI0Z47saa	You can take him as soon as he gets teeth mainly just to get him used to going to the dentist at a young age. All they will do is take a quick look and count their teeth, But they show definitely go by age 2.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Around here they say the first time should be around the age of 2 or 3. What is the point in taking a child to the dentist when the child has no teeth?

578d3fb2ddadd63f9be866329b168f56aa	my son turned orange for a bit when he started solids too. your doc is right there is nothing wrong with it. i too had to endure the orange comments, but they didn't bother me. i was just happy my kid was healthy and eating things that were good for him. it only lasts a short time. whatever you do, don't stop giving him orange veggies all together. it's the beta carotine that is making him change color. it's really not a big deal, i'm sure his skin color isn't bothering him in the least. i chuckle looking back on is baby pics now..he was still cute as a button..he coulda been purple or blue for all i cared, long as he was happy and healthy. <br>  the only thing that will end the orangness is to cut back on beta carotine which is primarily a lot of the orange fruits and veggies...to me the pro is not nearly worth the con.<br>  people generally don't mean any harm with the comments. if it really bothers you, then politely tell them, that the jokes are getting old, and while they aren't intentionally trying to hurt your feelings, you don't find it humorous and that you'd rather not discuss it.<br>  <br>  my sister was one to always comment on it, i didn't mind, but funnily enough, 2 years later she had an orange baby herself. it's nothing, many babies go through it, i think people just tend to forget, and are sometimes maybe caught off guard by it.|`|VS8mactUaa	Its just the vitamin c and natural dyes, give it a day with NO orange veggies or fruit, if it doesnt go away, call a doctor the very next day. Good Luck|`|8j7FCEOraa	It'll take a couple days, his old skin cells just need to die off as his body creates new skin cells. Patience is all you need. Maybe kick the jokes by going along with them, put him in a shirt with a little carrot on it. It'll be a cute story when he grows up.|`|w4zjmhxoaa	Hey!  It's from beta carotene, not just orange veggies.  I googled this once.  It's also in things you wouldn't think of, like bananas.  As long as you have a good mixture of foods, it shouldn't be long before he goes back to normal (a few days? maybe a week?)<br>  <br>  My son's nose was always orange!|`|ibJIXDOHaa	I had a friend that ate carrots all the time and her skin turned orange and she went a two week with out eating and orange and her color came back just find. Now i might not take that long for his skin color to come back.|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	get him checked for jaundice - and change the doctor..
LTD0qL6Yaa	Yes it is a part of your mucas plug!!!! I had the exact same thing with my last pregnancy 1 time on the tuesday and then again on the thursday and then went into labour on the saturday night. Congrates.....you have a baby on the way....|`|M21c8MQ9aa	Yup its your plug, I'm suprised you're still pregnant at 39 weeks|`|PA11NoYDaa	call the doctor|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Normally it would be one big blob or a few some blobs...almost like clots.|`|be5076c0b98b495ffe00aade08f96b65aa	It's definitely your membranes either thinning, or partial loss of your mucus plug. It doesn't necessarily mean your dilating, it just means things are starting to happen. I would advise your doc tonight, since tomorrow is Saturday. You may have a baby by Sunday, or you may have a baby in a week or 2, just depends on when the water breaks.
HFWLYMD6aa	Yeas i get the same way around and on my period. I get moody. It's probably also cause i hate having periods. lol. makes it worse.|`|gxGsqNPPaa	I used to be on Yasmin and i had to get off of it because it the hormone level in it was too high for me and made me EXTRA unbearably emotional. It even caused me to have an anxiety attack once a month, when I had never had them before. So it can definitely alter your emotions in a negative way. You may want to mention your new symptoms to your ob/gyn and ask if you need a lower hormone level birth control.|`|be5076c0b98b495ffe00aade08f96b65aa	OMG yes. Even without being on the pill, I was an emotional wreck. For 2 weeks before my period, especially the week before, I would cry when I was mad or sad. Then 2 weeks after I was a nympho...lol.|`|8fw3zE3gaa	Oh yeah very normal.|`|F2RkFhbpaa	Well you should go see your doctor, because any changes in a period if you are on any sort of pill like this could be nothing or there could be something wrong, either way dont worry but go see a doctor sweetie :)|`|PA11NoYDaa	Yeah i think the hormones in the pill make you more emotional. If it gets too bad talk to your dr about switching birth control.|`|p0prrzf2aa	normally yes|`|H2IhRXIIaa	YUP
Na1HDNncaa	lmao!!!!! im sorry! its just funny!!<br>  <br>  anyways, i dnt thnk i'd blame him or feel wierd about it..i mean if the girl kicked him really hard... well it WAS his weak spot.. heck i thnk it'd be really sweet of him to try to get in the middle for me not to get hurt! i'd probably jumped the girl for hurting him..<br>  <br>  i mean thnk about it..its like a guy pummeling our boobs..OUCH! lol<br>  it dsnt mean that we're weak..just that they got us in our weak spot..|`|N24wkFROaa	So what if he lost it to a girl? This is 2009 not the 1800's, woman are equal, just because he's a guy doesn't mean he's stronger? So what if there was 20 girls against 1 guy the guy would win? I don't think so.<br>  <br>  Oh and kicking him in the balls is just weak, you know he might need surgery and will probably never be able to have children? Hope she's happy.|`|MG7CLjtjaa	Getting kicked in the balls doesn't count as losing. He wasn't trying to fight her anyway, he was trying to control her and stop the fight. I wouldn't think any less of him.|`|E6T9DPT9aa	There's fighting and there's kicking in the balls.<br>  <br>  Kicking in the balls is an acceptable reason for him to 'lose' a fight.<br>  <br>  But I think his maniliness was lost when he started the fight with a female...<br>  <br>  Who'd want to be with him if he'd beat a girl?<br>  <br>  All my best (:<br>  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|hko5rrVoaa	A Man Is Someone Who Definetly Doesnt Hit A Girl. And Have You Ever Been Hit Down There! It Hurts! Of Course He's Gonna Fall To The Ground. But Still I Honestly Rather Have Him Loose And Make Fun Of Him Then Him Going Around Hittinqq Girls. That's Just Uqqh!|`|AA11537580	he didn't lose the fight, she kicked him in the "you know what" and that  will bring any man down|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	That's a cheap shot. I wouldn't blame him.|`|yawDBFo8aa	one, that doesn't mean he isn't manly.<br>  once a guy gets kicked in the balls, he's down for a while, also it shows that he is extremely for not actually "fighting back" after all it was a girl, not a guy. I bet if it was a guy he would have kicked his a$$, but it proves he won't hit a girl, and that is very manly in my opinion.<br>  I would feel fine with him losing a fight to a girl. :)|`|la8W09sFaa	take into consideration that a male's testicular area is extremly sensitive. a simple pluck or tap to the testes can be extremly painful to them, because their genitalia is located on the outer part of their bodies makes that private area extremly vulnerable that's why it is so disabling for a man to be hit there. that boy went through alot of pain trying to protect you. he was trying to control her not fight her as u stated, so there was no fight for him to lose.and the last thing u should be questioning right now is his manliness.|`|tBtOTiQDaa	if i was a girl<br>  then i would personally kick her in the throat<br>  no one messes with my spouse<br>  and if a dude seriously injured my wife,<br>  i would kill him, or at least severley injure him<br>  he did not lose a fight<br>  losing a fight is getting your *** kicked, not your balls|`|kxUigIkraa	I would feel grateful that he took a kick in the balls to protect me.|`|jzrvA1pXaa	That doesn't count.|`|QJf2XNaTaa	Umm, she's scary!|`|XnIdLz9xaa	she kicked him in the balls, thats cheap. u WHORE|`|9LXXs93haa	This has nothing to do about being a"man" for goodness sake!How would you feel as in physically if someone grabbed your boobs and squeezed it really hard? These are body parts we're talking about,reproductive organs wherein there are lots of nerves and arteries that can be damaged.You should be ashamed for yourself for doubting the manliness of your bf,he is trying to protect you and at the same time considerate enough to understand that he can't just have a "go" and punch a girl,would he?|`|fURZEyDuaa	well i suppose that if he got kicked there it would really really hurt but i think i still would have been a little angry that he didnt have full potential to protect me but then again if he tuck up for you thats good too at least he gave it a shot .|`|hfodUPg9aa	I would say he is a gentleman for not knocking her lights out after kicking him in the balls. Guys aren't supposed to physically fight girls. It's just wrong.

f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	our friend is a little harsh, 7:30 is hardly late, and its really none of the friends business if they WERE there late.|`|FkGh0LuWaa	No it is not weird at all as long as you are ok with it.  My four and two year old have their friends over until 8 on Fridays and Saturdays and a lot of times they will stay over as well.  It doesn't mean she doesn't care about her child she is just letting her have some fun and isn't being an overprotective parent.|`|Od73sfkxaa	I don't think so, especially if you and her are friends. If you guys were not friends and rarely met or talked...then that would be a different story.<br>  <br>  Plus, Fridays are the weekend...and they don't have school the next day.<br>  <br>  Does she ever offer to watch your son? Just out of curiosity.<br>  <br>  It's healthy for kids to spend time playing and having fun...they are children for only so long...|`|UxG6CkU2aa	I don't see anything wierd about it at all. Perfectly normal. Did your friend say that because it was a girl coming over to play with your son? I am just confused, because it seems fine to me.|`|gJrHBtp1aa	There are times that my daughter goes over to the neighbours and plays with their kids until its bedtime, I care about her considerably but if its not interfering with her sleep I have no problems. She's 4.|`|0ky4TktEaa	No it's not weird. You and her mother are friends and you've babysat her sometimes overnight. There's nothing wrong with her coming over to play in the evenings. It's not like they'll be up half the night binging on sweets or something. These are little kids. The person who made that comment was probably wondering why a parent would send their child out to play that close to the age appropriate bed time (around 8-8:30 pm). It's really no different than a child who is taken to visit him family members or eat dinner at their homes. The child is still out and about in the late evening. Doesn't mean the parents care about the child less.
ZbivePUfaa	Weeks before I knew I was pregnant I realized that my breasts were very tender.  While it wasn't a shooting pain like you described, but there was definitely a soreness to them.  When I found out I was pregnant it suddenly all made sense!  Like another user said, though, this can also be a symptom of your period.  If this usually doesn't happen before/during your period, however, I would definitely get a home pregnancy test or see your doctor to know for sure.  <br>  <br>  And even if you get your period, it wouldn't hurt to take a HPT.  I had my period the first month I was pregnant so I didn't even know I was pregnant for the first two months!  I had thought the breast tenderness was just a new period symptom I was experiencing.  haha  <br>  <br>  Best of luck!  :-)|`|a1590dfcb7c7233ad7d79b4bac121507aa	It's very possible.  I knew I was pregnant very early in the pregnancy because my boobs reacted the same way as you're describing.|`|xq7S9H5Raa	Why not take a pregnancy test because that is the only way you would know.  If you are congrats!|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Well the breast issue is also a period symptom so it could go either way.  I noticed my breasts were sore 4 days before my period was due and so I took a test and it was positive.
LTD0qL6Yaa	I did not test positive on a HPT until 16 DPO. I started brown spotting 2 days before my period was due and so i just thought AF was on the way. But 4 days later when the color and flow had not changed i thought i would test again and i got a BFP. I am now 6 weeks. Good luck and you certainly could be testing too early, i even got a negative at 13 DPO.

They do not grow out of it, because my Husband still pees on the seat.|`|0mZfOStiaa	Encourage him, not punish. Try positive reinforcement. Tell him what a good job he does next time he does it. Say, "You almost got it all in! Let's go have some milk and cookies." <br>  I mean, punishment will only aggravate the situation.<br>  Good luck!|`|7SXMetYQaa	lock them outside and make them drink water from the hose|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I would make him clean it up every single time.

oXIYHsDaaa	Boon makes a spoon called a squirt it holds pureed baby food so you don't have to use a bowl. I bought it because I thought it would be great when we went out somewhere with baby. Turns out it's great all the time because it stops her from getting her hands covered in baby food from grabbing the spoon, saves a ton of mess, and I can feed her with one hand so I can eat at the same time.<br>  <a href="http://www.booninc.com/products/Squirt" rel="nofollow">http://www.booninc.com/products/Squirt</a><br>  <br>  The angel care movement monitor, my daughter started sleeping through the night at about 6 weeks and it was scary to wake up in the morning and realize she hadn't cried in like 10 hours. To top it off she has had some apnoea episodes so I'm totally paranoid about SIDS. I got the angel care monitor and now I can sleep at night without getting up every hour to make sure she's breathing, it's a bit pricey but it's worth it for the piece of mind.<br>  <a href="http://www.angelcare-monitor.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.angelcare-monitor.com/</a><br>  <br>  Added note: Try to buy your bouncy chair, exersaucer, jolly jumper, swing and any other "great but you only use it for 3 months" equipment at a kid's consignment store. That way the items cost about half the price and  when you're done with it you can take it back to the consignment store and sell it again and you get half your money back so your swing, seat, bouncer, whatever only cost you a quarter of the price a new one would have and you're recycling.<br>  <br>  *I really really really like our bumbo chair, we use it instead of a high chair because our house is so small we don't have room for a high chair, just make sure you try one out before you buy one, some babies love them and other absolutly hate them and for $60 you don't want to take a chance*|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	Breastfeeding pillow was a waste of money for me, so was the cradle we bought, she sleeps in bed with us. I think a better investment would have been a co-sleeper. Also I got way too many 0 - 6 months old outfits, you only need a two dozen of each size anymore and you should take them back and buy the bigger sizes you'll need farther down the line. A great brand of bottles particularly for breastfed babies is breastflow by learning curve. Receiving blanket are great but by the time they 6 weeks old the blankets are too small for a good swaddle, bigger blankets are a good idea. <br>  <br>  <br>  An invaluable thing for me was the slings I made, they were simple to make and are a life saver when you have chores you need to get done but the baby doesn't want to be put down, it's also the only way I can get her to sleep when she's having gas pains. Check on ebay for some cheap ones if you don't wanna make one yourself.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	pampers sensitive wipes, pampers diapers, soft indoor hats, socks, scratch mittens, triple paste diaper cream, aquaphor lotion, humidifier that's easy to clean and filter free if possible (filters cost a fortune!)<br>  pack n play, swing, bouncy, boppy - loved them all!<br>  <br>  useless: bumbo, steam sterilizer (you can just boil the bottles and pacifiers in water), wipe warmer<br>  <br>  if you're using powder formula - buy the baby water with fluoride and just mix - room temp - no need to heat anything up|`|sFGgPTk3aa	Infant tylenol is a must have....you never know when your baby might have a fever or begin teething..you don't want to be running out in the middle of the night.  We also couldn't live without Little Tummy's gas drops.  Our little guy had some issues with his formula so these were a life saver while we were getting him settled on a new kind.  Receiving blankets make great burp clothes and are usually cheaper and bigger than normal burp clothes.  We also used Target brand baby wipes.  They are comparable to Huggies or Pampers, I can't remember which. They are cheaper also and you can buy them in bulk.  Baby powder was completely useless.  Our pediatrician told us that people use baby powder more when they use cloth diapers to help with absorption, but that it would just get stuck in babies crevices.  Good luck!|`|CzKrqgmgaa	i have to agree with another poster about the boon squirt! that is so awesome!!! most of boon's products are wonderful too!<br>  kirkland (costco's brand) diapers and wipes are absolutley awesome! and cheap too :)|`|qqiVKUBpaa	A sleepy wrap carrier! That thing has saved my life! Also if it weren't for her swing I would never get to eat anything. I like the multi purpose Desitin because you can use it for diaper rash and the dry skin that they get on their face, hands and feet. I personally think a wipe warmer is totally worth it! My baby girl bawls her eyes out when I use cold wipes, and I think a pack n play is a must have! You can use it in place of a bassinet when they're tiny, when they get older they've got a play pen, and everywhere in between they have a portable bed that they can take to Grandma's when you are in desperate need of a night out. If you plan on breastfeeding get a pump so you can pump milk if you need to and have a couple cans of formula on hand in case of an emergency. Also you can't ever get enough p.j.'s because you'll probably change them 2 or 3 times a day. A Fels Naptha bar works great to get the baby poop out of clothes.<br>  <br>  On the flip side, I found my breastfeeding pillow to be pretty useless, a regular pillow just worked better for me because I could lay it on an angle.|`|deIzFnV8aa	Don't buy too many clothes! Everyone will buy you clothes for your shower or when baby comes. People you  have never even met! Confine yourself to undershirts and other non-cute essentials.<br>  <br>  People will also give you many burp clothes, hats, socks (which never stay on), bibs and recieving blankets. I would go light on these items at least until after a shower, if you are having one, and possibly until after teh actual birth.<br>  <br>  Get cheap diapers for the first few weeks as many of them never even leave the changing table. We have continued to be pleased with Target brand diapers up to 5 months.<br>  <br>  But NOT with Target brand diaper rash cream. It smells like fish! (the use cod liver oil as an igredient!)<br>  <br>  You are almost certainly going to end up needing baby lotion for dry skin.  We live the Aveeno calming lavendar lotion, and also use Aquaphor (a thick vaseline) for really dry areas.  It can also be used as a diaper rash cream and a drool protectant; our pediatrician says it is worth its wt in gold and I am inclined to agree.|`|a1590dfcb7c7233ad7d79b4bac121507aa	What I found was that babies really don't need all the "stuff".  We go totally overboard with baby things... when really... they only use it for a year or two.<br>  <br>  diaper cream - Destin.... 100% the best stuff ever!!<br>  <br>  diapers - I used Pampers Baby Dry... all depends on your baby's shape<br>  <br>  baby food - I liked the organic jarred stuff  Gerber was good... keep it simple.  The jarred meal foods like "chicken and pasta and veggies" is terrible.<br>  <br>  formula (if you need to use it) - save your money and get the store-brand stuff.  There's no point in spending twice as much on name-brand stuff... it all comes from the same manufacturing plant.<br>  <br>  thermometer - a plain old mercury thermometer... stick in under the armpit<br>  <br>  strollers - I started with Safety First.  It was very durable, but very bulky.  I ended up with an Evenflo, which has been much more user friendly.<br>  <br>  carseats - infant carseat... Evenflo.  They are the deepest and most compact.  Convertible carseat... Safety First.  I've been really happy with it (2 years now).|`|6fiYhtACaa	Things I can't live without and didn't know that I would need:<br>  MOBY WRAP - looks like a big piece of fabric but you can get so much done with baby in one of these and baby loves being in it.<br>  GRACO BABY JUMPER. Some of the best $30.00 I've ever spent.<br>  AVEENO CREAMY BABY WASH. Leaves baby so soft.<br>  EXERSAUCER. Didn't know cooking dinner while home alone was possible until sister gave me one. Keeps baby occupied just long enough.<br>  MUSTELA FOAMING BABY SHAMPOO. Works wonders on cradle cap.<br>  <br>  Wastes of money:<br>  BOPPY PILLOW. Thought that would be a must-have for breastfeeding moms. Never really felt comfortable using it and it keeps baby in a lateral position instead of letting their bottom drop down a little to help with digestion. It did come in handy for a short time while baby was getting used to sitting up and toppling backward, but really any throw pillow would suffice.<br>  INFANTINO SLING. Tried two. First the side carrying kind which was so uncomfortable and baby hung like a sack of rocks. Then the baby Bjorn fixed style which hurt both of us.<br>  SHOES. Baby is nearly 10 months and never been able to wear any shoes. Never been able to wedge his fat feet into them.|`|tA7WDLm4aa	well one thing u may be tempted to get or that others may get u because they are sooooooo cute and irresistble are shoes. Especially hard soled shoes. They are all so stinkin cute and I got a ton, than I realized that he either grew quicker than I even could think to put them on him, or I would put them on him and than take them off because I thought they may be uncomfortable. Or he just simply kicks them off. So if I feel like they were/are a waste. But that's just my opinion. :)|`|VR9KhbEgaa	Best-<br>  Bouncy Seat<br>  Wipes Warmer<br>  Infant car seat cover if you have a baby in the winter<br>  Jumperoo<br>  Sleepers with zippers rather then buttons<br>  Sleep Sacks ( Halo sleepers)<br>  Pack-N-Play( 3 way type)<br>  <br>  Worst-<br>  Diaper Genie<br>  Bumbo Seat<br>  <br>  Thats just my opinions.

I used it for feeding when my son was born.  its good for tummy time when they get older.  my son is 14 months now and it's basically his security blanket! he always plays with it on the floor and cuddles with it in his crib!  and its comfy to do crosswords on it! haha|`|Ij2rM3H4aa	Didn't realize we needed:<br>   1.  Baby bouncer/chair- this was a life saver.  We liked the Fisher-Price combination rocker chair, as you can raise the back to sit or lower it to sleep.  My daughter is a little older now and doesn't use it as much, but it allowed me to use the bathroom when I needed.<br>  2.  Different bottles:  Maybe it's just out daughter, but she was (and still is) super finicky about anything that goes in her mouth.  We went through 5 different brands of bottles before finding one she'd tolerate.<br>  3.  Cold water sterilizer:  I know they don't have these in the States, but we couldn't be without one- it will sterilize anything you drop in it within 15 minutes, and it's baby safe.  What more could you ask for?<br>  4.  Changing table/bath combo:  So convienient- no bending over the bath with a teeny baby- this saved my back and let me have a better grip on my slippery daughter.<br>  5.  Angelcare baby movement monitor:  It's so scary when they sleep for long stretches, and this gives a great deal of reassurance by picking up their breathing movements. <br>  6.  Muslin squares/burping cloths:  Essential, and used for absolutely everything from spit-up to a make-do blanket.|`|51jVOdq5aa	DIAPER PAIL always a must. Honestly its one of the few things im grateful we got. One helpful tip is getting a Gerber shirt that can be open up front so you wont have to keep on disturbing the babys belly button esp. on the first few weeks. Trust me its not wise to put on onesies when its not yet healed. I would also recommend exposing the baby to sunlight few times a day to prevent bilirubin formation that would cause the baby to be yellow (hyperbilirubinemia). This is crucial on the first few weeks when the baby's liver is still developing so it will help in the breakdown of bilirubin. Same thing happened to my son when he was still 1 week old. We end up putting him in a UV bed for few days and a week trip to the hospital to monitor his bili level. It was indeed stressful so i suggest sun exposure is a must.|`|2LmfQUbKaa	i found that it isnt so much the name is to how good it worked like the themo that u use in the ear that is good and desetine cream thats real good! and dont spend all your momney on the highest whipes and pampers they all work the same! you can get alot of the little things for your baby from a dollar store i know it sounds crazy but if you take the time to walk around a good one you will be suprised! another thing that i loved is the swing and the bouncer the one you hang from the wall! or the one they sit in and it vibrates! dont make the mistake of letting your baby sleep all day it will get all messed up and for get it! another good thing is the two way speakers to listen to them gerber i think is real good! well good luck to you mommy!|`|Q7lvSU03aa	Okay I have two items that are a waste of money. <br>  1. tummy time mats.  Literally a pad about 2 feet long and a themed pillow.  You can totally get the same effect with a normal blanket and pillow.  Also my daughter would scrunch it up when I put her on it because it was so small.<br>  2.  Diaper Genie - we got rid of ours because it was such a pain to use and get the diapers in and out of.  Now we just use a normal trash can, and throw smelly diapers right in the outside trash.  Newborn's diapers do not even smell that much so it isn't a big deal.<br>  <br>  Try making your own baby food!|`|d2b0aa9f5bb25df636762ecbc09df34eaa	Burp clothes are ULTRA important you will use them so often, so buy lots you can never have enough. Also I prefer the Huggies brand of wipes (Huggies natural) because they don't smell, I tried Pampers wipes and they smelled funny to me. Oh and Alcohol pads to wipe baby's umbilical cord right after he's born, no one told me to buy those! You'll need a small box of those, good luck and congrats!!|`|puFIUwWHaa	For us it was the Magic Sleepsuit - could not have gotten any sleep without it!|`|caM1Syyfaa	I wished someone answered this question before I gave birth:<br>  <br>  In terms of clothing:<br>  - I always loved using a short-sleeved, legless body suit underneath and a long-sleeved, long-legged sleepsuit over it. Always buy sleepsuits that close at the front, not the back. Buy 100% cotton, light colours, that can be washed @ 90-95 degree Celsius (basically highest temperature), even if the label states otherwise they will be fine, maybe get a bit smaller and it's more hygenic. People will offer you a lot of long sleeved body suits which look sweet but I found them useless, the baby could feel too hot wearing 2 layers of long sleeves. Try to anticipate the size of your baby, if you are being told it's going to be a big one, buy 0-3 months rahter than newborn clothes.<br>  <br>  - now that your baby will be born in spring, you might need a vest or a slightly thicker bodysuit (not too tight) for outside, rather than a snowsuit<br>  <br>  - buy hats that cover the ears (most of them are impossible to perform this function!); mittens can be good if the baby is scratching the face or if you need to apply cream / oil on the hands for some reason; didn't really find socks useful once she wore the sleepsuit, and she would kick them off anyway; same w booties, wouldn't use them for newborn to 6 months<br>  <br>  - cotton blankets that can be wrapped around her; if the baby sleeps in a basket he/she won't kick it off or pull it over their face if you gently bind the blanket around the baby, or fit it underneath the mat<br>  <br>  - I found a Moses basket useful, although I bought a cot too (ultimately, the baby will move to the cot). For now I am keeping the basket in the cot, and put the baby to sleep in it, she feels secure as she can sense the boundaries of her little universe otherwise she will crawl until she senses smth is touching her head. Also the basket is very useful if when I take the baby to the living room during day time<br>  <br>  - standard diaper cream helped, so did the nail clipper, thermometer (you need to monitor the baby's temperature after immunisations, at least); buy hypoallergenic baby shampoo / soap, no scent or colour, if your baby turns to be allergic you wouldn't even be able to use those ones (I use an emolient instead of soap), olive oil seems to be the best massage cream (at least that's what UK pediatricians recommend); baby towels (w embedded triangle for the head), and a plastic sheet to put the baby on underneath the towel while I dry her skin (in case she passes some urin while I do that); bibs can be useful but not a must, I breastfeed the baby and even if she spits milk sometimes I would just change my t-shirt (I have a lot of plain vanilla cotton t-shirts that I wear at home)<br>  <br>  - chaning table is good for your back, yet buy one that wouldn't enable your baby to fall of it (with a high board on the sides, if smth like that exists)<br>  <br>  - for bathing I used smth called tummy tub, it is easier to use if your back is hurting than the traditional baby tub<br>  <br>  - then I bought the legally required car seat and a baby stroller that can be converted into a pushchair when the baby can sit. I realised buggies w big wheels are very good for walks through the park on slummy days, snow etc.<br>  <br>  - I used Pampers, they have been great. If you breastfeed, baby poop won't smell that bad btw. If you breastfeed, use a breast pump, it will help against engorgement, or if you want to go out one evening. I also use the bottle warming machine from Philips Avent. For breast milk storage I loved the following storage tray, I think it is coming from the US:<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Breast-Milk-Storage-Tray-Pack/dp/B000TENP0Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=baby&qid=1235784360&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Breast-Milk-Stor...</a><br>  <br>  - Don't use alcohol for the baby's tummy, it is an old method not used anymore as alcohol is absorbed very quickly into the baby's blood through the thin delicate skin. I was recommended to use boild salted water to clean that area once the tummy fell off<br>  <br>  - Also it would be better not to use wipes indoors (outdoors you have no choice), all of them have chemicals in them; I found oval cotton pads most useful, which I dip into a plastic mini-box w warm water. Make sure you throw the water away after use, as water will attract bacteria from the air if you leave it there for hours until next nappy change<br>  <br>  I hope this helps|`|oxxbjM2taa	Onesies <br>  Sleepers and/or gowns <br>  Socks <br>  Hats <br>  Sweaters <br>  Snowsuit bag<br>  Baby tub <br>  Baby toiletries <br>  Baby washcloths <br>  Baby bath towels<br>  Front carrier, sling, and/or backpack<br>  Boppy (or other nursing pillow) and cover <br>  Breast pump <br>  Breast milk storage and feeding set <br>  Insulated carrying case for transporting milk safely<br>  Bottles <br>  Assorted nipples <br>  Utensils for formula preparation <br>  Sterilizer, if recommended <br>  Formula <br>  Bottle and nipple brush<br>  <br>  Highchair <br>  Bibs <br>  Baby utensils <br>  Food mill, for grinding up food for baby <br>  Plates and bowls<br>  Board books <br>  Gymini <br>  Soft blocks <br>  Rattles <br>  Teething rings <br>  Puzzles<br>  Receiving blankets (for swaddling) <br>  Pacifiers <br>  Music CDs <br>  Swing<br>  portable crib <br>  Waterproof crib pads<br>  Outlet covers <br>  Baby gates <br>  Door latches <br>  Toilet latch <br>  Non-slip tub mat <br>  Padding for sharp table edges <br>  Doorknob guards <br>  Stove knob guards<br>  <br>  -A sleep sack they're a brilliant way to keep baby warm at night without blankets, which baby can kick off<br>  <br>  -Lap Pads for the crib and changing table (so you don't always have to change the entire cover or sheet) i foud this was a lot easier for me to deal with since im a new mommy =]|`|n6XYYyoLaa	well, u can go to babies r us website and they have a list for ppl who are going to register..of course it has a lot of things on there that you don't need, but if you weed through you can get what you need out of it...the things i liked;found most useful, etc......<br>  <br>  .i would def recommend:<br>  a diaper genie 2; idk why ppl don't like them, there is NO smell in my dd 's room<br>  changing table..will save your back, good for diap changes, clothes changes, sponge baths, etc and you have shelves to store your new baby must haves....i have canvas bins on the shelves to store things that are good to have in reach or easily available...<br>  monitor--i like the graco imonitor, recently bought a second one for another room in the house bc i liked the other one so much, it has been working well for over 8 mos now, and it has good range, battery life, and i can hear EVERYTHING; never any interference....it works great..<br>  boppy pillow with cotton covers, soft ones don't fit as well for some reason<br>  lots of baby hangers, and baby hangers with clips to keep outfits together<br>  primo euro bathtub<br>  prince lionheart diaper depot and wipewarmer; ours works well and the wipes are still very warm when  we get them to out dd's bottom; and she doesn't freak out when we are out and they aren't warmed, but seems to appreciate it when they are..<br>  health kit: brush, comb, thermometer (not an ear one, not as accurate), nail clippers, etc.<br>  baby meds, generic is just as good and a lot cheaper...desitin(or plain zinc oxide if you can find it)..not creamy, has less zinc ox in it....infant mylicon and tylenol<br>  lots of diapers , make sure wherever you buy them will let you exchange them for a diff size if you need to even after the return period...brus let me do that, and buy a small pack of a couple brands to see which you prefer before you open the big boxes...wipes, lots of them, without alcohol or fragrance!

My doc. said that eye color is the most fickle body part you have. Some people have the same color up until they hit adulthood. you can never know he said. but blue eyes arent impossible from both parents having brown. according to the doc, the blue eye is Bb which means brown dominant blue recessive. so she might just keep those sapphire blues!|`|GNLYxY7kaa	8 months is when they start fixating on their permanent color. my son has blue/grey eyes and me and the hubby have hazel.......my mom has the blue/grey eyes. its funny how genetics work but it is safe to say my son enherited my mothers eye color.|`|2LmfQUbKaa	i think they will stay blue it is possible that they can change i cant see them changing that much! it is usally what you see when they open them for the very first time is what you will be looking in to for ever! congrats!|`|2ac2Ecxoaa	Well the Blue eyed Allele is a recessive trait, this means that both you and your husband may have one brown allele and one Blue allele, the brown one is dominant and so your eyes are Brown. <br>  <br>  Your daughter however may have gotten one Blue allele from you and one Blue allele from your husband and therefore with 2 Blue alleles her eyes are Blue!<br>  <br>  It's quite confusing, and I don't really know how long it takes for a baby's eye colour to stay, but that might let you know where her Blue eyes may have come from!|`|SjX72fPyaa	It takes up to a year sometimes before they settle on their true colour.

I think its the prettiest hair/eye combo there is.|`|qqiVKUBpaa	It can be 6 months to a year before their eyes reach their true color.

Yn6pM2Xyaa	googled wiki got this: The extent of scar formation is critical. Small scars can usually be treated with success. Extensive obliteration of the uterine cavity or fallopian tube openings (ostia) may require several surgical interventions or even be uncorrectable. In this case surrogacy, IVF or adoption may be advised.<br>  <br>  Patients who carry a pregnancy after correction of Asherman's syndrome may have an increased risk of having abnormal placentation including placenta accreta[21] where the placenta invades the uterus more deeply, leading to complications in placental separation after delivery. Premature delivery,[22] second-trimester pregnancy loss,[23] and uterine rupture[24] are other reported complications. They may also develop incompetent cervix where the cervix can no longer support the growing weight of the fetus, the pressure causes the placenta to rupture and the mother goes into premature labour. Cerclage is a surgical stitch which helps support the cervix if needed.[23]<br>  <br>  The overall pregnancy rate after adhesiolysis was 60% and the live birth rate was 38.9% according to one study.[25] Success is related to the severity of the adhesions with 93, 78, and 57% pregnancies achieved after treatment of mild, moderate and severe adhesions, respectively and resulting in 81, 66, and 32% live birth rates, respectively.[9]<br>  <br>  Age is another factor contributing to fertility outcomes after treatment of Asherman's. For women under 35 years of age treated for severe adhesions, pregnancy rates were 66.6% compared to 23.5% in women older than 35.[21]

I believe that people under that age of 16 should have to abort the child if it is discovered at early stages of pregnancy, as i think its punishing the parent for their child's stupidity as the child can't afford to keep the baby. However i draw the line at people aborting babies 12 weeks and onwards. Because they must have noticed by then. I think abortion should be a very last resort, as i don't agree on the latest trend of people seeing Abortion as another contraceptive! WHEN ITS IS NOT!|`|z8YGEk0qaa	I don't like abortion but I believe that in some cases it is justified....example, 14 year old girl gets raped in an alley or on her way to school and ends up pregnant....I think she should be able to make that decision without judgment....on the other hand, a 19 year old who just wants to keep partying....sorry hun, but you got yourself into it....you know what I mean...|`|wVKTIzOEaa	love the caps by the way...<br>   because life is not all dandy. its their choice, not yours, or any other old bigot who thinks there should be laws against free choice. life is not kind most of the time. would you feel the same way if you were raped? or how about incest rape, people dont like to talk about it but it happens... all the time.|`|25c6d5700e6137614608981bc5f7d45daa	lol - this coming from the person who SMOKES weed to feel better at 11 wks .<br>  <br>  if your not pregnant ; then why did you js say you were in your LAST question ?|`|E7R7D1onaa	im so glad someone else believes like me...|`|8EJfR0d2aa	You're entailed to your opinion, and so am I. Don't forget, that everyone has different beliefs. <br>  <br>  It's my opinion, that if a woman, for whatever reason wants and abortion, that it's her own personal choice & decision to make. I can't choose what other woman want to do with their bodies. I'm pro choice because I feel that the implications of having an abortion, are so traumatic that, judging someone, for doing what is best for them, at that point in time can't be right. I'm pro choice, because not all women have to have a child, and should not be forced into having a child they don't want. Women fought for their rights less than 100 years ago, and I don't see why being forced into keeping a child you don't want, when you have no purpose to love or care for the child or no reason to be interested in doing the best for the child is called ''been a good responsible person'' ....  <br>  <br>  I bet you don't like being looked down upon by your peers for something your regret doing, so I don't see why you can make these statements, and not even try to develope your point or ''fact'' to carry out a valid, or worthwhile debate. Your facts & opinions are weak, and you probably have no educated knowledge on the subject judging you exasperational typing skills !<br>  <br>  Some women have obortions for many reasons - no finnancial support to carry them through their pregnancy, and no fincial aid for them or their child once it is born. <br>  <br>  Illness - such as cancer : treatments like radiotherypy & chemotherypy will damage any featous in multipal ways, such as brith defects, mental redardation & can slow the developing of the child.<br>  <br>  * If someone was to fall pregnant, and decide on an obortion, it doesn't make any sense, why they should go through a pregnancy, when they won;t enjoy it, when they won't enjoy the baby once it;s born, when they won't have any prize for putting theor bodies through all this ... and just to put a child into a system and lable them .... THAT doesn't make sense in my eyes !|`|Rbm99GOcaa	Ok no one get mad at me please.<br>  <br>  I myself would never be able to have an abortion but I can see why some people do it.<br>  <br>  Imagine if you were raped and ended up getting pregnant. Would you really want to have that child inside you for 9 months reminding you of the event of its conception. I know you could/should give the child up for adoption but being raped is a hard thing to live with (you may be depressed, turn to drugs, alcohol) and none of these things are good for baby.<br>  <br>  If you are a teenager( young ) and do not want the child and are not able to look after the baby. You may opt for an abortion rather then face the 'embarrassment' of being pregnant. (In my opinion you screwed up and face the consequences) <br>  <br>  If the mother is not able to provide a healthy pregnancy for the baby, If the mother is addicted to hard drugs or is not able to stay clean and healthy and provide the child with the proper care when it is in the womb. They should stop everything and think of their baby first, but we all know there are people in different circumstances.<br>  <br>  If the baby is going to kill the mother because of a pregnancy complication. If neither the mother can live because of the baby and the baby can't live with out the mother. Why not try to save the mother.<br>  <br>  As I said before abortion should be used as a necessity only. And only under certain circumstances. I agree that it is too available and used too much as a form of contraception. I would never get an abortion but I can see the other side of the story. I hope That this answer helps you see the other side of the story. But I see your side too|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	I do in the case of medical reasons =)<br>  <br>  some agree with rape but i dont think a baby should be killed for anothers crime.....<sigh> it also depends on my mood and the persons situation if i agree or not, it not that im agenst it but im not for it either|`|AA12016833	I believe abortion should occur if a person cannot support a child in any way. And is not willing to go through having their child taken away.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	Until you're in the situation yourself of facing the prospect of abortion or adoption then you'll never know. In my experience it's only people who've never had the terror of an unwanted pregnancy that asked these questions. <br>  <br>  By the way you should go get a life instead of trying to get attention by asking such a "controversial" question.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Some people aren't ready to go through PREGNANCY...it really sucks.  Yeah, maybe adoption is a better option, or keeping it, but that takes somebody really strong.  Also, when you plan on putting your kid up for adoption, like I said it takes a lot to be pregnant, being sick, missing work, etc.  Not saying if I'm for or against, but you asked for reasons why people do it.|`|oem5yEUDaa	I would like to know why people think they have a say it what others do with their bodies. How exactly does it affect you if someone gets an abortion? How does that change anything in your life? If abortion was illegal how many children would be out there that are neglected? How many children out there would have to suffer for weeks and months on end starving to death because their parents couldn't afford to support them? How many more children would suffer from being abuse by their parents who didn't want them in the first place? Accidents do happen, people do take precautions that sometimes fail. I think it is worse to bring an unwanted child into the world and make it suffer. If you truly cared why are you not out trying to save these types of children?|`|WPI0Z47saa	I don't understand especially in certain situations why anyone would have a problem with abortion. My neighbor found out when she was 4 months that her baby had down syndrom, a hole in its heart, one kidney and half a brain. She did abort. Why would anyone think it was better if this child were born. Even the doctors said that it would at most live hours after birth and then die. What is wrong with this? You would rather the child suffer outside the womb?|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	First off there are tons of kids out there who still need to be adopted but end up just growing out of the system because people who really want a child only want one who is an infant.   Where is the justice in that?  I think abortion is ok in rape/incest/genetic problem cases.|`|8fw3zE3gaa	You hAve a point . Stuff happens That you can not always control. Heath reasons can cause someone to have one. Having an abortion is harder on one mentaly then having a baby. <br>  <br>  Don't judge you don't know what it is like. I never had one never would but my friend did no way in hell she could have had that baby.|`|5jjGo6XTaa	u just ask the question is it ok to smoke pot if your pregger or you asked what will happen to the baby and me if you smoked pot smothing like that. and then you deleted the question cause ppol got mad so you are either 10 years old or a pot smoking ready to abort pregnant lil girl or there is somthing very wrong with you|`|aMlWMkO5aa	I am pro choice because women have the right to make choices when it comes to their body.If a woman gets raped she has the right to get an abortion, I would not want to carry the baby to term. Some people have a hard time with the idea of carrying a baby and then handing him/her over to strangers.|`|CPPBqVaaaa	woow at lala boo..<br>  um some ppl might do it because they have been raped..<br>  others bc it was a mistake and have an std to go along with it..<br>  most bc they are too young.. and no1 is supporting them if they are trying to keep the baby.. but having n abortion isnt murder..|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I agree with Rene.<br>  <br>  I believe in choice, whatever you choose is your business.

df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	it's normal.  you built a trusting relationship with a guy friend and you probably discuss or tell him personal things.  this is no different than a normal relationship.  in relationships people need trust and closeness.  you're finding these things with your male friends.  after building that trust you start to see those guys in a different way.  it's not always a good thing because you risk losing a friend if the relationship doesn't work out.  <br>  <br>  i don't think you're doing it on purpose.  it just happens.  if you're willing to risk the friendship, then pursue the relationship.  if not, then do what you can to keep is strictly friends.|`|9aIotOULaa	HORMONES :0<br>  <br>  most likely because you already have some sort of relationship with them and you probably feel really comfortable around them it is hard to distinguish you "friend" feelings from your romantic ones|`|hfodUPg9aa	Cuz there so d@mn hot!|`|N24wkFROaa	Haha I feel exactly the same, I keep getting crushes on my guy friends.<br>  <br>  Like the first answer its probably just hormones and stuff :D<br>  <br>  Well that's life!
oem5yEUDaa	If they were involved in drugs or crime I would probably hate them and try to get my child to leave them, because I know what it's like to be with a drug addict and it is so emotionally damaging. I can't really think of anything else, even if I did not like their personality that doesn't really matter because I'm not the one that's with them and it's not my choice. I think considerably older would be more than five years older, but again that wouldn't really matter unless my child was a young teenager.|`|gJrHBtp1aa	Considerably older would be in my uncles case. He's 49, and dating a girl younger than me and I'm 24. While I don't hate her because of it, I do wonder what type of example he's setting for my 16 year old twin cousins.<br>  <br>  The only thing that would cause me to "hate" my daughters husband or my sons wife (when they are old enough to get married) is physical or mental abuse.|`|Axi9yDabaa	Considerably older, to me (18), would be 7 or more years older.  I would dislike my child's significant other if I believed that they were not trying to make him/her happy, if I did not like that person's background, if they don't seem to be going anywhere or doing anything with their life.  <br>  <br>  Maybe your wife's parents just weren't ready to let go.  There are tons of things.|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	I don't think age would be something that would make me hate you, but it would make me cautious. The only thing that would make me hate you is if you beat my daughter up, or cheated on her. I'm sure there are other unethical treatments of women that would make me hate you but those are the only two I can think of at the moment<br>  <br>  oh yah and if you were Atheist|`|b6EyFLgUaa	MY mother in law and I have a great dislike for one another. Why- because she thinks i stole her baby boy, shes just really a extremely selfish human being. Were the same age but i think significantly older is more then 30 years. My mother has dated a few men that were more then 20 and there is a difference there but ive seen some relationship with that kind of age gap that works out too. If my daughter wasn't happy, he took her away from us ( like moved her across country) or something along those lines ( of course if he abused her too). I hate talking on hte phone with my MIL if its longer then about 10 mins i try to get off or give the phone to my husband.

qKEKLOaEaa	at 7 weeks tummy time isn't necessary for your baby's development. I would wait until atleast 2 months to re-introduce the idea of tummy time. If she hates it then don't force it on her. just continue to try for a few minutes here and there. Babies don't really develop strong neck muscles until they are  about 4-5 months old so be very careful with her head and neck at this young age.<br>    When she gets older and you notice that maybe something isn't quite right with her development then talk to your Dr. but in the mean time, enjoy her infant-hood. It goes by fast :)|`|EyKJ737daa	Sweetie there is nothing wrong with your baby.  All babies develop this ability of holding their heads up at different times.  What you read are only guides, they are not rules!  The more tummy time bub has the better she will become as she learns to focus on things while on her tummy and will then eventually reach for them.  All my babies hated tummy time because it always made them throw up as they were all reflux babies.  My eldest was the worst.  You could try putting bub down on a firm pillow on her tummy with her chest and arms towards the top of the pillow so her head almost "hangs" over the edge of the pillow.  This may help her and also put toys in and just out of her reach so she is encouraged to look at them.  All of this will help strengthen her neck muscles but please don't worry, she will do it when she's good and ready.  All the best and take care x|`|TvYX1yXWaa	my son is 4 months old and hates to be on his stomach .. he still cant lift his head .. im putting him on his stomach more and more each day to get him use to it..|`|deIzFnV8aa	Don't stress, all babies do things at their own rate!  Many babies still have a wiggly head at that age.  And most babies don't like tummy time too much! Its best to try and give them several short periods of tummy time during the day, instead of one long one, stopping as soon as she gets upset.<br>  <br>   But since you will stress no matter what we all say about it, here are a few ideas for helping her enjoy tummy time:<br>  <br>  Start with tummy time at an angle instead of flat, since this way she will have some help holding her head up. You can put her on your inclined chest or knees, for example.<br>  <br>  In a similar idea, prop her up by putting a boppy or a rolled blanket under her arms, so she has help. Put things in front of her to look at. A mirror is something many babies really enjoy - a crib mirror with toys is excellent, but any hand mirror is great, too.<br>  <br>  Do tummy time in ways that she needs to use her muscles just to hold his head flat (not up) - like flying him on your knees, or with your arms.<br>  <br>  Play "roll over" by letting her play on the floor on her back, then rolling her to his front just for very short periods of time before rolling her back. Increase the amount of time on her tummy as she gets more comfortable with it.<br>  <br>  Have tummy time chest to chest with you.<br>  <br>  Help her sit up, supporting his neck if he needs it. This also builds neck muscles.|`|xmmpqySUaa	She may be a bit young...her head is not ready yet and neither is her body.she needs upper strength.Dont do tummy time for a while...she could possibly get seriously injured...if your baby can hold her own head up when on her tummy then you can start, she may not like it until this is totally comfortable for her to do without too much strain on her little body if she doesn't like it don't do it for another while.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ask your doctor good upper exercises to help make the upper body stronger.|`|J4YNRrsuaa	Its ok, my baby is 6 months old and never had tummy time. I tried multiple times but he would throw a fit. I know its suppose to strenthen their muscles, but he never had it and has been reaching all his milestones early. He was even sitting up on his own right before he turned 5 months. So i wouldnt worry about it.

OgzHcNMsaa	3 hrs of labour, 12 mins of pushing, 1st degree laceration,5 and a half pound baby girl. It was my first. If they get shorter after this I better live at the hospital for my second or else it'll just drop out|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	I started labor at 10:00pm by feeling that I had to pee really badly. My water broke while I was in the bathroom, and my contractions were 3 minutes apart, so we went into the hospital. By the time I got to the hospital, I was 4cm dilated. They discovered that our daughter had pooped in me (I forget the medical term?) so I had to be hooked up to a bunch of monitors for me and her. After 3 hours of hard labor, I decided to get an epideral. It took another 2 hours to get the epi (it was the middle of the night, and the maternity ward was full). By 7:00 am, I was fully dilated. I just kind of lay there for the next 3 hours, because my doctor had another baby to deliver at the same time as me. Then, at 10:00am, the nurse came and got me to start pushing. By 10:40, I was crowning, and our beautiful daughter was born at 10:59am. On my one last big push, I ripped a bit. Brianna (our daughter) was in great shape...8lbs 10oz, and absolutely perfect :)|`|8kaDm2D8aa	after the epidural, easy pesy lemon squeezy.  before that it hurt like hell!|`|690279cb7caa51056d2e306c73dae94faa	Long and difficult.  It took 30 hours to get to the pushing part.  Then after that, the hospital took my baby away for 3 hours because it's "hospital policy" blah.  I hated giving birth in a hospital.  My midwife kept pushing a c-section but I wouldn't budge.  As if I can't make my own decision,she also tried to get me to sign the release form for the c-section for a just in case scenario.  Like I am going to fall for that.|`|AuVtUjVAaa	Mine was painful. 31 hours until he was born.  By the time I got to the hospital, I was already 7cm, got the epidural and I was in heaven. That pretty much slowed my labour down, 8 hrs later I started pushing for 2 hrs and 50 mins and he was born. They had to use forceps, vaccuum, and an episiotomy... I was hurting the next day.|`|LbkLg4RFaa	My total labour was 6 hours.  Two of those hours were pushing and that was the worst part because it was the most tiring and nothing seemed to be happening.  I don't like needles and there was no way I was going to have an epidural because of it.  I'm thankful I didn't require any as I think that would have made the whole process more frightening for me.|`|Ij2rM3H4aa	It was great, actually.  It was 12 hours long (but trust me, the time flies), and I did it without any analgesia (which, I must say, was not my original birth plan- I wanted drugs, or at least gas and air- but when I went into labour I just got into a zone and knew that I would be fine and that I could do it).  I gave birth in a hospital, and the nice thing about giving birth in the UK is that you don't automatically get an IV and fluids to cart around.  Also, you're free to move around and do what you want during labour (providing everything's going well), which I found very useful, as I spent most of my labour on a birthing ball (which was fantastic).  My top tip, though, is to hire a doula.  We hired a trainee doula (cheaper and slightly less official experience), and I could not have been more pleased- she was there during the entire process (along with my husband, of course), and had wonderful advice on breathing and relaxation techniques.  She was also the one who gave me the book that, I think, made all the difference in how I perceived labour- Ina May's Guide to Childbirth by Ina May Gaskins.  I would absolutely recommend reading it, and it allowed me to come away from the whole labour and birthing process feeling very positive and empowered.  Best of luck, and congratulations.|`|aGORltJPaa	My first child came out in 15 minutes after 2 hours of labour!  The doctors told me it was the quickest birth they ever seen! I had gas and air.  Also I was 4 weeks early...<br>  <br>  My second child took 10 hours and that was long and painful. Had gas and air again.<br>  I was six weeks early...<br>  <br>  My third child took 4 hours in labour. I had gas and air.<br>  His heartbeat slowed down so they rolled me onto my left side whilse flat on my back but that was too painful for me and I couldne stay in that position!  So they put me on stirrups which later swelled up both my calfs for days and barely could walk.<br>  I was 3 weeks early...<br>  <br>  My fourth child took 8 hours in labour. Has gas and air.<br>  He was taking too long to come out so I had a ventouse delivery- pulled through with suction.<br>  I was 2 weeks early...|`|CnLL5ENmaa	ya, mine was the same. labor was 24 hours, but once i had the epi. it was better.  once i felt i had to push, I had to wait 4 hours!!  I guess I wasn't getting the point across that I REALLY needed to, then my dr. was in a c-section, but when it came time, it only took 15 minutes.  and it was the best experience ever! my son is 14 months and still when I watch A Baby Story on tv, I cry! I can't wait to do it again!|`|2LmfQUbKaa	well i went into labor with my first one when he was only 5 months and that was a nightmare! he stayed in the hospital for almost 5 mnths! he is great now my second i went into labor with him and he was rirring out of my bag into my stomach and i had a c section with both but with the 2nd after i had him he was great no problems i hope the same for you! good luck!|`|BCJRJNfvaa	I went into labor with my twins around 3pm. They soon discovered one baby was breech. After trying to turn him, after I dilated, we went for the c-section. Samuel and Leah were born at 11:03 and 11:05 respectively and are doing awesome! It was pretty short and sweet. I wanted natural birth, but I'm just happy my babies are here!!|`|YJNql5Mgaa	Eh, pretty good.  I was in labor for less than 9 hours before my daughter was born via emergency c-section due to a footling breech. (foot first.)  But oh man, it was painful. Her foot was literally almost out by the time I got to the hospital.
0JmDT1AJaa	From experience - the pill TOTALLY screws up your system! I came off in October ttc, and had one slightly late period...thought that was all i was going to get from the screwy hormones....but then my next period didnt come!! I didnt start ovulating and having normal periods again until the end of january.<br>  Got so worried i went to the doctors office, after spending a fortune on hpt thinking i was late due to pregnancy.<br>  <br>  My advice would be not to get your hopes up...maybe you will have a different experience, every woman does, but take each month as it comes...do lots of baby dancing, and hope for the best until your periods become regular again.<br>  <br>  You never know, you may be lucky and catch it at the right time and get your BFP...but if not, at least by the time your ovulating again you will be really clued up on all the TTC lingo!!<br>  <br>  Good luck, i hope you have a  better time of it...
nBqTrmkJaa	hi hun, i would get it checked out by your midwife immediately or at A & E, which ever is quicker for you. it's better to be safe than sorry.<br>  i am 5 weeks 5 days pregnant and fpr the past couple of weeks have had sharp stabbing pains in my uterus/pelvic area and by my ovaries, also radiating discomfort. i went to the drs and this is how i found out i was pregnant. he said i was 8 weeks pregnant going by my last dates of period. i was told the pain was from my uterus stretching from where baby is embedding... that's a heck of a lot of pain for a stretching uterus....<br>  i ended up in more pain a few days later, went back to my dr who sent me straight to hospital with a suspected ectopic pregnancy... that was on Monday this week.<br>  i had my blood pressure done, a pelvic exam and a vaginal ultrasound. the baby is in the uterus/right place which of course is great and this is when they told me i am 5 weeks. i have to go back next thursday to check for a fetal pole as is still so early on, but i am still getting the pains and they can't explain why. i do suffer from Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome and they stated it could have been a cyst popping yet they can't see any cysts at the moment (maybe thats because they popped? but if so why am i still getting discomfort).<br>  <br>  i feel for you hun i really do. i'm crapping myself that i'll lose this baby after thinking we'd never be able to conceive to to my fertility problems yet i'm trying to stay calm and think positve. my fiance has been a great reassurance to me.<br>  <br>  please, if only to ease your worries, do go and get yourself checked out asap. no one here can tell you for sure what is going on, but you'll be closer to an answer if you go get checked by your local hospital and an ultrasound done to check how baby is doing <br>  <br>  good luck xx|`|WBJrzwKuaa	There's a very good chance that you did miscarry.  I understand that you want to know now, maybe you can go to an urgent care center?  Sometimes women don't even realize they're pregnant, and when they miscarry they think it's just a super bad period.  Start charting your cycle...your waking temperature will help you decipher if you're pregnant for one, and if you're about to miscarry if you do in fact get pregnant.<br>  <br>  Best of luck...|`|gfwQ5tFaaa	Your doctor is right, I know its hard but you should calm down and relax, if you are miscarrying there is nothing the doctor can do to stop it. If you continue to bleed (like you are having a period) and blood clots persist to come out, head to the E.R. there isn't much you can do to stop a miscarriage sorry =[ just pray and hope for the best.|`|Rtz3NreVaa	I havent had babies yet.. but i had a friend that she going through that and the doctor told her that she was very close in having a miscarriage, but luckily the baby was saved and she was born very healthy.   YOU SHOULD GO TO THE HOSPITAL, I DONT THINK IS NORMAL!!|`|aXm6wS8paa	im sorry i dint think this is normal you should go to the hospital ASAP <br>  <br>  good luck|`|7pfsyda4aa	awh this sucks.<br>  go to another doctor nd ask if he can check it out for you.|`|vnFAAJ0Qaa	she isn't crazy...your doctor cant do anything if you are having a miscarriage. I had terrible pains and spotting through  my entire pregnancy. the pains were worse when I was standing. I have a beautiful five month old son. so dont jump to conclusions because if you aren't miscarrying the stress of worrying can be harmful to your fetus. I know it is hard to keep your mind off of what may be happening. I miscarried twice before I had my son but there is always another chance to have a baby...If i had listened to my Dr I wouldn't have a baby as he said with my history It would be near impossible to carry a child to term that I should have a hysterectomy because I had a lot of pain...so hang in there no matter the outcome of this trial you have another chance even if your dr says otherwise!|`|VS8mactUaa	It sounds like you are miscarrying Im so sorry, and when you said they stopped after a clot, that may have been the baby, you may have already miscarried. If you havent yet, just relax, added stress may make you miscarry as well drink plenty of fluids and stay off your feet, there is no way to fully stop a miscarriage. Im so sorry to hear this, you will be in my prayers and thoughts, Baby dust to you. :) Keep Strong.|`|Nm7Hy67oaa	I had cramping and bleeding but no blood clot.  And I ended up being fine.  However, I did not have the blood clot.  Refrain from sex, lay on your left side, drink plenty of water, and light some relaxing scented candles.  The more you stress, the more likely you are to miscarry.  If the pain gets too severe, go to the ER, else, wait for Monday to see your doctor.  I know that is not what you want to hear, but sadly, not much can be done to stop or prevent a a woman from miscarrying.  Most are caused from a genetic flaw in which the baby would not have survived anyways.  Not very reassuring I know, but it better than getting attached and later having a still birth.  Good luck....really hope you any your little one make it out okay|`|nqkXE1cUaa	You could miscarry.<br>  Just stay calm, do everything you need, continue taking prenatal vitamins and such...<br>  Just wait till monday.<br>  My mom had her first child a miscarriage, but don't worry. She now has six smart kids and we always remember gracy as the sister we never had.|`|kUCVLuTPaa	sorry to say this but with the clot and the 45% miscarriage rate in your first trimester it does sound like miscarriage..try again because since you miscarried this time your uterus will be the ideal place for a new baby to survive so most likely you won't miscarry next time|`|dn2UCOkqaa	Theres nothing the doctor can do. So your just gonna have to follow her advice and dont stress. Stressing out can make it worse|`|CpotQhwkaa	sounds like a possible miscarriage. i'm sorry. you'll just have to wait until you see her.|`|xq7S9H5Raa	The signs and symptoms of a miscarriage is severe cramping and red bleeding.  Unfortunately at this stage if it is going to happen there is nothing the doctor can do.  Try to also stay off your fee as much as you can and try not too worry.  I know that it is hard to do  I really wish you the best.|`|ce32Y7I9aa	I was reading these peoples answers and apparently they have never had a baby! DON'T LISTEN TO THEM!! Cramping is very normal in the begging of pregnancy I cramped the whole time and my son is 8 months and healthy. It is also normal for you to spot the first couple of months during pregnancy. If it isn't heavy bleeding I wouldn't freak out. Also if your doc did an internal exam for any reason it can cause spotting. Sit down, out your feet up, and relax. Good luck!|`|I6qfoJaiaa	At this stage there really is nothing the dr can do, if the cramping gets worse or you start bleeding real heavily you can go to the ER. There is you did infact miscarry they will be able to tell and then take the next step. I would lay down and drink lots of fluids.|`|Ls93X4ufaa	No! This is not normal! Sure a little bit of spotting when you would have had your period might be normal, but serious pain and clots are not. I would go to the emergency room asap! Better safe than sorry. Good luck and god bless you and your baby.|`|yxbwwYgFaa	yea during the first weeks of pregnancy,   women are in risk of having miscarriage <br>  but do what your doctor told you...just stay calm and take it easy and take really good care of yourself <br>  <br>  Good luck.... to you and your baby|`|LBg4DNpCaa	I dont know what to tell you minimum cramping is very normal but bleeding is not. Im sorry.|`|97nXJF24aa	sorry to hear that but more than likely your prolly gonna miscariage and if and when you do you'll have to go to the er|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	Honestly, I would call your local ER, talk to a nurse there and ask them what you should do.  Tell them about the blood clot (that could possibly have been the baby) and get checked out right away.  I am positive that the ER nurse would tell you to come in ASAP to get checked out.  I'm saying a prayer for you and your baby!  I wish you the best of luck!  Oh, and try hard not to stress...that makes things worse, hang in there!  Also, see if you can get someone to drive you to the ER....I hope you go!  Good luck!
4xMg5dYCaa	are female moth exterminators called mythbusters?
kRaVa0Wraa	LOL TROLL.|`|PG7WfGpHaa	Tell her your little brother has congenital syphilis, and so will any kid he fathers.  Offer her an abortion so as to avoid a tragedy.|`|N24wkFROaa	I don't think his balls have dropped yet mate.|`|0qP8gLpyaa	IF this is real a 12 year old can't take care of themselves let alone a baby. She won't be able to get work. The first year alone in raising a child with clothing, food, diapers, wipes, doctors visits and just the basic equipment they need will run you THOUSANDS of dollars into five figures. No 12 year old has that kind of money or ability AND that at 12 her body is not ready to handle childbirth and it increases her chances of dying during the process because of the damage it is going to cause to her body.<br>  She needs to come to her senses and realize she is not at an age or financial ability or responsibility to keep a baby.  If the parents are stepping up to help then she isn't going to have a choice..unless she wants to be a murderer and kill it. To me that is NOT an option. <br>  Sadly this is a good reason that children shouldn't be fooling around with sex.|`|xc6iCPUQaa	Ok I think a guy can always produce sperm but a girl can't get pregnant unless they have already hit pubirty and they have there period. I dk what to tell you except that a 10 year old and a 12 year old should not be having sex in the first place and the perents should be taking care of the 12 year old and her unborn child better.|`|JCxue4qhaa	ha ha. that was funny, but i doubt it's even true|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	there's nothing you can do to make her give up the baby.  abortion is only the woman's choice, not the man (or boy in this case). <br>  <br>  i can't believe your 10 yr old brother was having sex.  how in god's name does this happen?!?!?  where were your parents?  don't they monitor their son?!?  how old are you?  i hope you're learning from this experience and don't have unprotected sex.<br>  <br>  now i know i'll need to have the sex talk at a very young age with my children (when i have them).|`|soFpywFcaa	you cant make her give it up but i know that if no one else is taking responsibility for the child when she gives birth she will not be able to take that child home.......try telling her that she could dye giving birth because she is so young|`|hJWjSWYXaa	ok well first off you need to tell child service about a child being pregnant and you need to have a vary real talk with your parents! and i hope this is just a joke!|`|08Ksc5Oiaa	You can't -- Oh, wait, you're right, this is 2009.  I'll give you a new answer:<br>  <br>  You can't.|`|IHw2qUtcaa	Wtf thats messed up dude.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	ladies  guys   ,,, this question on all the time ,,,,,|`|gpJOSJw0aa	fckn troll.|`|E6T9DPT9aa	and i'm elvis presley.<br>  <br>  All my best (:<br>  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|9aIotOULaa	you can't force her to do anything<br>  <br>  but you can talk to her and give her your imput, remember to be openminded and that this is a rather traumatic experience because they are so young.<br>  <br>  Also her parents have probably explored this option and you need to consider their opinions on this topic before you can force her to make a decision|`|wqqY6rjFaa	you cant make her give it up its still her choice and her parents choice..and it being 2009 means nothing this is a child and i know its a messed up situation but one question why was the 10 year old alone enough to have had sex you would think him bn only 10 he would have been watched over abit better..her parents are the one who makes the decision she is still a minor|`|qlhDCAPyaa	well taht's weired 10 year old boy having sex with 12 year old girl but i understand in what situation ur and the girl's family is and its really hard for the girl to give up  the baby. so the best thing would be that the girl give her baby to her mom and she can always see that baby at her home and take care of the baby.|`|yKS2UI87aa	You can't it's her baby too. Obviously he was not old enough to have sex responsibly so kinda like the saying goes...Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.

But yes, pointing that out to her might not be a bad idea.  I'm sure she was not thinking about that when she picked her names, but it IS unfortunate.|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	Well, first off, if it's your cousin's child, it would be your second cousin not your nephew, and second, I don't think you should say anything about it.  It seems like that would be really rude to me.|`|PzbRJrTKaa	yess, i think you should. in my art class, we had to do something with or initials, and if he had to put that..........wow<br>  <br>  good luck i think you should tell her|`|Aj99vuqYaa	You should! that kid will be scarred for life.

"hey you know your kids going to have the initials ***" Kids are prob. going to make fun of him at one point or another. <br>  <br>  If i were a kid i wouldnt want those initials or that middle name haha but yeah just mention it in case she doesnt already realize it, idk how she couldnt though. idk why a parent would knowingly do that.|`|j0Jkq4z2aa	i think you should tell her. I mean, the middle name would be fine, but not paired with the first and last... if he ever had to do something in school with initials... wow. yeah. good luck! point it out to her kindly, though.|`|eznL5Zwvaa	I know how you feel,my sister did the same thing to my niece.I pointed it out to her,she laughed and did nothing.My niece is 23 now and as far as I know she never suffered from it.Hope this helps.|`|j6HzYs1haa	you should tell, her, i almost had those initials until my mom noticed, and now i just don't have a middle name|`|Uo0b2aShaa	thats kinda funny

soFpywFcaa	sounds like a irregular early period
EnBPpbcHaa	I disagree with making a donation to the hospital...seeing as that is indirect and typically goes towards hospital expansion and not necessarily towards the children. There are several programs where you can buy books for these children, dolls, and toys etc...There is nothing you can do to ease the pain, but the suffering can be cut to a minimum. These children typically don't have anything of their own inside the hospital, and just want time. Perhaps you could volunteer as well? I would definitely go with books though, they last a lifetime, and are always good company. Or perhaps talk to the head of that wing and perhaps plan a trip to the zoo or something like that. Your son sounds like a good person, and humanity needs more of his kind. <br>  <br>  Also, I would make the party in the hospital wing, with cake and pizza for all... I bet it was a while since they have been to a birthday party...?|`|Yeb2nZTFaa	I love the earlier answer of giving children's books and toys for him to take to the hospital with him.  What about joining him on his birthday when he volunteers and take him to dinner afterwords.  That way he will see how much you value him and what is important to him.|`|aee3e2d1f7825b37d0270adec5b84e7daa	I think you have already given him a lot. From what you said he is very level headed.

God bless.Roy|`|dhaYdWwaaa	make a large/generous donation to the hospital.|`|AA11537580	buy a bunch of books, games and toys and wrap them up for him , then he can donate them to the hospital|`|6sJhoXAAaa	If he feels that strongly about it, take whatever money you would have spent on his gift and donate it to the children's hospital in his name. You could still have a cake or token gift for him.

WNsjy5oFaa	see a doctor - go to emergency, a new pregnancy needs to be ruled out but also as you have just had an iud fitted it could be that you have an infection, also it could be that you have some retained products post the abortion that have become infected and will make you unwell. <br>  its not unusual to spot for sometime after having an iud fitted but as you are experiencing lots of pain you need to have this investigated<br>  <br>  hope your get well soon<br>  <a href="http://www.fpa.org.uk/Information/Readourinformationbooklets/IUD" rel="nofollow">http://www.fpa.org.uk/Information/Readou...</a>|`|ZHJuK1QNaa	If you were experiencing an ectopic pregnancy the pain would be getting worse not better.  The pain you describe makes me worry too, its gone on way too long and is not normal. You may have and infection or another problem if the IUS was placed incorrectly.  <br>  Please get into a doctor as soon as possible.|`|vygYFdsSaa	Oh hun this must be horrible for you. An ectopic pregnancy is very rare I think the pain is usually concentrated on one side. You should get yourself to the emergency room because once the fetus reaches a certain size it bursts in your fallopian tube and this can cause serious complications for you, including death. Please go get checked out I hope everything's all right.|`|HIhhAV1Aaa	you should really get to hospital just in case,becasue if it is etopic it can be very dangerous for you. dont feel ashamed about questions asked doctors see everything it best to safe trust me.|`|xq7S9H5Raa	In th emean time go to the ER because an Ultrasound can be performed to see the location of the implanted egg.|`|9P26sacKaa	If it were ectopic, you should have had increasing pain, not decreasing pain.  However, any abdominal pain like this needs to be reported to your doctor and severe abdominal pain means you need to go to the hospital.  Since you've already registered with your doctor's office, call them and talk to the nurse/doctor to see what you should od.  There could be something wrong with your IUD or that you're pregnant.  The headaches are another bad thing, considering your abdominal pain.  I'd call the doctor ASAP and get ready to head to the hospital.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
5yAsj29Vaa	Lets get your mind straight on something here... when your bf urinated has nothing to do with your chances of pregnancy.  It's a myth that urinating before sex decreases the risk of pregnancy.  With the information you've given, yes, you could be pregnant.<br>  How your bf would know if you're pregnant (without you telling him) is beyond me.  <br>  Did you not get your period in February?  If not, take a test; it's pretty simple.|`|be5076c0b98b495ffe00aade08f96b65aa	You have a 50/50 chance. Take a test. Urination has nothing to do with conception by the way. Also your bf would have no idea if you were or weren't.|`|aGORltJPaa	You can get pregnant so easily.  You only need a tiny drop of sperm to make a baby.<br>  Also sperm can live inside you for upto 5 days.<br>  <br>  Best to have a pregnancy test as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  Use a condom!|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	Every time you have sex without using protection there is a chance of pregnancy. If your period comes on the first of the month well it's almost here so you will just have to wait and see.|`|bhnPUzypaa	People can still get pregnant even if he pulls out its called pre-*** which could infact get you pregnant, I suggest you take a test just to make sure.<br>  <br>  Good Luck
df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	i just read the same question and was wondering the same thing, but these days it's not outside the realm of possibilities.  a kid his age may not understand the consequences, but i'm certain he knows what sex is and how to do it.  it's still very disturbing to know a 10 and 12 yrs are pregnant.<br>  <br>  i used to think it was big deal that little girls at the age of 10 and 11 are starting their period so young, but these same kids are having sex now.|`|ZCSOJUYVaa	This is true. Im not sure what country it was in, UK or something like that a 10 year old boy got his girlfriend pregnant and she just gave birth to a little girl. At 10 years you would be suprised how much boys know about sex, not necessarily how to have it, but I am sure alot have heard about it from friends, etc. It is scary what the world is coming too, I mean, totally unacceptable that a 10yr old is having sex. ADD: IT WAS AN 11 YR OLD BOY, OOPS. And its in LONDON.|`|otKIUViRaa	He would have to been a very mature 10 yr old, I do not believe this story, he could of performed intercourse, but as far as impregnating her I doubt it.<br>  Kids learn more at school and from there peers at a early age and they also have internet and tv to teach them things, I have heard of a lot worse.<br>  Parents both work and kids are left with time on their hands, kids reach the age of adolescence faster than we did .|`|6gthdHpnaa	It is possible for a ten year old to get pregnant and have a period, and most kids of that age are aware of what sex is.

I am waiting until the morning when his friend goes home and I am going to have a long long long talk with my son|`|3Pmq0rUMaa	my mom told me and my sister about sex when we were nine. we were starting to get boobs..and you can get your period as young as age nine.  i think that 10 is a very reasonable age.  having sex at ten...isn't..i wouldn't know how to have sex my mom just told us about periods and stuff. and then how a baby is made..no details|`|PoYFQ7Mxaa	It's sad, but it wouldn't surprise me if it's true.

caM1Syyfaa	Please just don't name your baby Colt.. :)<br>  Jayden sounds great, although Jaden looks like a cooler spelling.<br>  I don't like Christopher though, all the Christophers I know are just conservative grumpy old men. However I think you are right about a 3-syllable middle name (assuming Cathey is the surname). <br>  Why don't you find a more modern 3 or 2 syllable middle name? Like Jaden Daryl Cathey (that sounds so prompt and manly in my opinion) or Jaden Xavier Cathey (sounds foreign and intellectual - girls who will date him will think wow, his parents speak French, he must be well-educated and open-minded etc.). You can use Hendrik if you want to go for foreign/Germanic. I also like the name David for instance it is as old as Adam and Eve and still immortal, David never sounds old. Anyway, that is how I would have named my baby if she was a boy (it's girl whose middle name is Jade btw :) <br>  Sorry for giving so much unsolicited advice. That's what I did when I was searching for my daughter's name, asking for feedback all the time.

ddP3klT3aa	The pill is not strong enough. It is called break through bleeding. Call your OBGYN and tell him what is going on..he needs to prescribe you a new pill. You can get pregnant if you continue to take it. Just tell him you have been having break through bleeding for a new months.|`|Eh9Tmgzhaa	call a doctor check it out|`|cfe02e6ae5ad9f610e0881cb2edcb2cfaa	Brown blood is usually old blood or blood that has gotten in the air. I would say it's left over from your spotting or your period. I would check with your doctor to make sure nothing else is going on, maybe the hormone level in the pills is not right for you. You should also ask about getting checked for a bacterial infection (not an STD) as this would irritate the cervix and could be why you're having irregular bleeding.
hzgFAJv0aa	Dear Romany,<br>  <br>  I ONLY agreed to adoption because I was told that my children would NOT suffer not knowing who I am. I was promised that "open" adoption would PREVENT the issues the closed records cause because we would always have contact. I was unaware that the APs could close the adoption after finalization. <br>  <br>  I would have parented otherwise.<br>  <br>  For me, closed records are a reason NOT to place a child for adoption and I would have made very different decisions had I known that "open" adoption are unenforceable soley BECAUSE of closed records - even without knowing what I know now about the effects of adoption on adoptees and first parents. I would NEVER wish to hide or be unknown to my offspring. I don't purposely cause pain for people I love...<br>  <br>  ETA: Only one of my 4 pregnancies was "unintentional".|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	In a hypothetical situation that I was pregnant and for some reason the decision came down to abortion or adoption, open records would not factor into it at all.  It would not make me more likely to choose abortion.  <br>  <br>  We all know that there are three possible choices with any pregnancy: abortion, parenting or adoption.  I can't think of any situation that would make me rule out parenting, but this is a hypothetical situation so I'm just going along with it.  <br>  <br>  Personally, the only way I would ever have an abortion is if my life were in danger.  Even then, I would get a second opinion (or 3rd, 4th...)  But aside from that, I would never have an abortion.  Never. I believe that life is precious and that a chance at life is always better than no chance.  <br>  <br>  I don't think that legally enforcing open records will cause a sudden jump in the abortion rates.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	Nope...been there had one.<br>  <br>  <br>  Looking back.....I would have had the abortion again.<br>  <br>  <br>  Adoption wasn't even a consideration.  If I had decided to to carry to term I would parent.<br>  <br>  <br>  If my only option was to give the baby up for adoption....I would have gone to another country to have the medical procedure done.|`|j0xfBk5Caa	Nothing would make me choose adoption again. Not open records, not open adoption promises, nothing. I have no desire to ever be pregnant again and no amount of prettying up adoption could force me to carry a pregnancy to term. If I did choose to carry a pregnancy to term nothing would convince me to choose adoption but that is a moot point since I will never bear another child again if it is truly my choice. <br>  <br>  I would never choose abortion just because my child could someday find me, I would choose abortion because I just don't want to be pregnant again.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	In states who have recently opened their adoptions records, the abortion rates have DECREASED, much to the dismay of the Anti-Choice lobbyists. They have long fought open adoptions AND access to OBC's, as they have said women would abort, rather than be found by their basturd child years on down the line. Anti-choice people just want more babies for the infertile- they could care less about the first mothers. Their flawed logic has backfired on them. <br>   <br>  BTW- I did have an abortion, but for the OPPOSITE reason. Because of closed records.|`|rbv1FH62aa	""Extra points for those who have actually MADE the decision.""<br>  <br>  Which 'decision' would that be....for abortion or adoption? Open records only exists lawfully in 6 or 7 states. What if a surrendering mother surrenders in a state where Open Records is still not allowed? Then what? What if the adoptive parent never tells the adopted child, that he/she was adopted, then what? In that case wouldn't matter if there was Open Records, since the adopted child may never even know they were adopted. Are you speaking more to Open Adoption then Open Records?|`|b7ff0c6859d6ba5cc891050de578e39daa	I would not have an abortion (I would have used multiple birth control methods if I didn't want a child - but that is not what you asked)<br>  <br>  In my case, I would ask one of my sister's to adopt the child if there were absolutely no way I could raise it so open records would not factor into the decision.<br>  <br>  If that were not possible,  I still think I would want the child to be able to find me 18 years later.  The child would have questions and emotions that would need to be dealt with.  I would feel it was my duty to do the best I could for the child even if I was unable to raise him/her.|`|xKSr1ld8aa	I wouldn't choose either I would choose to parent but if I was forced to choose abortion or adoption I would choose abortion but it has absolutely nothing to do with open or closed records.  I live in the UK where records are open and I was coerced into surrendering my son - I wanted to raise him even if it had been difficult.  We have been in reunion since 2004 and I have always loved him but nothing can replace the lost years which is a pain I have to live with.|`|mEzhsu9Eaa	Well if i were to base my answer off of the statistics in Oregon, after the records opened there in 98, abortions continued to decline and adoptions actually increased. <br>  <br>  Right to life can suck on that for a bit. <br>  <br>  If i were to have an unexpected pregnancy, i'd raise my child. :) I don't think that "open records" in adoption influences many decisions because as I have found, most people don't even know that sealed records exists. lmfao. People either abort, choose adoption as a quick escape, or parent. I did have an unexpected pregnancy and the dr. never said to me "don't worry gershom, records are sealed in this state, if you surrender she'll never find you." hehehe I can't possibly imagine never wanting my flesh and blood to find me either. Nevertheless she's sleeping in the next room as I type and I chose parenting, but still. Why would I want to hide from her? I'm her mother.|`|yEzCKWzEaa	No, the connection between abortion and open records makes no sense.  If I were to choose to have an abortion I wouldn't even be thinking of paperwork/records/adoption.  I would only be thinking about my reasons for being unable to continue with the pregnancy.  I can't even begin to imagine why abortion would have anything to do with adoption paperwork.|`|0mZfOStiaa	I currently HAVE to make that decision.<br>  My whole first trimester I didn't know that I was pregnant, and did drugs and stuff like that.<br>  Now these doctors tell me that there is an 80% chance that if I try to give birth that I will die. And the baby will too.<br>  My son is the only thing keeping me going these days, and I have to make this terrible decision.<br>  <br>  I am really thinking about getting an abortion just to save my son. Because I know where he will go. And God will take care of him until I see him again.<br>  Good luck sweetheart. I trust the decision you make will be the best thing for both of you and your child. :)|`|AA11987492	No, I would have an abortion, but NOT because of open records. I just will never choose adoption, open or closed.<br>  <br>  However, to answer your question, I would WANT my child to find me. Closed records just seal the deal on abortion for me.|`|E7MgO2pZaa	I'd have an abortion. I know that what the agencies and adoption officials tell you are lies created to soothe you into a false sense of comfort in order to convince you to give up your child.|`|RKcwfrGOaa	Sealed records don't guarantee a mother's anonymity as it is.  The mother is usually named on the adoption papers, and the adoptive parents are given a copy of these papers before the records are sealed.  The adoptive parents can choose to share this document with the adoptee, and it's perfectly legal.  The mother has no control over whether or not her child will ultimately be provided with her name.  The adoptive parents are the party whose degree of control over birth information will change with open records.<br>  <br>  I have a copy of my adoption decree provided by my adoptive parents in accordance with current statues.  My mother is named, and I assure you, she had no say in whether or not I received this information.<br>  <br>  Further, if for some reason, an adoption is never finalized, the original birth certificate will never be sealed, and her child will have access to it because it will be the only birth certificate.  Parents are NOT guaranteed anonymity under current law.  Sealed records were never designed to give any sort of promise of anonymity to original parents.<br>  <br>  ETA: Of course.  But if a woman thinks closed records promise anonymity, she's either mistaken, or she's been lied to.
51d5nUZKaa	well do not punish him. im a 14 year old and trust me, no matter how many times our parents yell at us and punish us for bad grades, most of us dont even listen and it just dosent help the situation. what my mom did that really helped me was every morning before school she would put a sticky note on the inside part of backpack that said "bring home all notes from today" and i would bring them home then later on right before i would go to bed she would help me study for about 15 minutes. then every day starting on tuesdays she would help me study more each night in that subject. (example: i got notes on monday, studied those on monday night. got notes on tuesday, studied notes from monday and tuesday. ect.) then eventually i just got into the habit of taking my books home and studying every night without her help. maybe it will work for him.<br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  oh and i wouldnt take away his sports just this one time. if its something you love, especially a sport and it gets taken from you, it can be very dramatic. just sit him down and tell say.... "i know you love running track and i know that your good at it. but just remember that if you want to become someone important someday, it requires an education even out on the track."|`|nKUyy2WLaa	I have to say i'm pretty much in the exact situation as your son. I'm 13, in track too (although i have pretty good grades.) Does your school have a gpa standard for joining sports? Here it's 2.0. Try telling your son that if his next report card had a D on it, he cannot join track next year. See if you can talk to the coach and get him a few days off track to stay after school and make up some work.|`|svqtl73Aaa	Do not take away sport if that is his greatest passion. I have seen too many athletes careers destroyed, because of someone taking it away. Some have committed suicide. Ground him or tell his coach to run extra for it, but do not take away sports. You do not know the reaction of it.|`|Q5GKWChoaa	Well, I love to sing.<br>  <br>  I'm 16 and I'm in choir. I have been told that I am the best male singer in the school. Singing is my life and my passion and I love to do it.<br>  <br>  I failed a class and my parents, knowing how much I love choir, took it away as punishment. They told me that I was never to sing again.<br>  <br>  They learned that it was a bad idea to do so, as they found me unconscious in a pool of my own blood. I had slit my wrists.<br>  <br>  They took away what I lived for. I tried to kill myself.<br>  <br>  <br>  If athletics are your son's passion, don't take it from him. My story should explain why.|`|opxwEh0Waa	That's a tough one.<br>  <br>  I'm assuming we both agree that hitting never works. No physical punishment.<br>  <br>  Try taking time out from your schedule to study with him. And reward him when he gets a good grade on his next test. <br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  Have you tried the whole 2-warning thing? Give him one warning of what his punishment will be the next time he gets a D or lower. Then if he doesn't heed your warning, give him one more. After that, bye-bye track. Your son is 13 and should be fully aware of your lower-than-a-C rule, and of its consequences. If he really cares about track, then he should give some more effort to his studies.<br>  <br>  If you really, really just don't have it in your heart to take track away from your son, then try taking away another privilege, like computer/games, or time with friends?|`|qRElKKjXaa	Get him a tutor. <br>  <br>  You should ask this in the Parenting section. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|gmaCvh00aa	That's a tough one.  You know they say never to go back on your word because the kid will use that, but I think if it's not your habit to do that, maybe you can make an alternate arrangement.<br>  <br>  How about sitting him down and reiterating what the punishment was supposed to be, and then telling him the truth--you really don't want to take that from him but something's got to change.  From there you're on your own, but if he's not a bad kid, just genuinely struggling, and running will be a thing positive for him, it might not be worth it to stick to your guns just for the sake of sticking to your guns.<br>  <br>  Good luck with this.  You sound like a good dad.

AA12376316	Yes, My daughter got thrush while breastfeeding and I got it on the breast. I actually used something called Gentian Violet. It's a chemical that's harmless to you and to the baby. I had to rub some of it on my breast and in the baby's mouth. Now, beware: It will turn your breast and the baby's mouth VERY purple. This is okay - it's normal. But this is what the dorctor told me to do for it, and it worked after only 3 treatments. It's an over the counter thing, but it's hard to find in your regular drugstore. I ordered mine online and it came in 2 days. It was such a great relief and a big help. You can look it up online to find it.It usually runs anywhere from $5 - $10 for a 2 oz bottle - depending on what percent solution you get (they a have a 1% solution for $5 and a 2% for closer to $10). I used the 2%, and I'm assuming that the 1% works just as well, it may just take a little longer to take effect.<br>  <br>  Good Luck. I hope this helps.|`|31f50b507e1f9bd42dc84b0947afb233aa	The child actually gets thrush in their mouths which can transfer the yeast infection to your nipple(s) and if left untreated they continue to reinfect themselves.  My pediatrician prescribed a Nystatin suspension which tastes like bananas (yes I tasted it, I didn't want my baby taking something I wouldn't try). -- I got mastitis from this with both babies and my ducts [nipple(s)] became plugged.  Mastitis is very painful and I had a fever of 103 F and the treatment is to keep nursing that breast as often as you can to keep it from staying blocked by puss.  The puss, though gross and hard to believe, doesn't hurt the baby.  It is so painful!!!  I can't remember if I received antibiotics or a cream for the nipple(s) but it did eventually clear-up.<br>  <br>  Limit beer/wine (anything fermented) intake (if you do drink beer), bread, sugar unless it is natural like in fruits, etc. as these contain yeast or help yeast grow.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA12014232	Yes, mine did.

Good Luck New Mom...|`|AA10628547	Mine did, I took her to the Doctor and they gave me medicine for her by mouth and then they gave me some to put on my breast. It is nothing to worry about it is normal any baby can get it. It is very easy to cure... Good luck to you and your baby!!!|`|bc8cf2af4734456f7a991e9ef828ec79aa	My baby was prescribed diflucan and i was prescribed nystatin, i think that's how it's spelled. anyway, the diflucan didn't work, so i bought something from CVS called "Gentian Violet" and it worked great. It didn't even cost $2. Call ahead of time because not all pharmacies carry it.<br>  <br>  You dip a Q Tip into the bottle and let your baby suck the liquid off. Be careful that you or the baby is wearing anything nice because this stuff stains items a deep purple.   Dont' be alarmed when you see your child has a purple stained mouth and lips, it will fade in about half a day.  After you stain the baby's mouth, let him nurse normally. Your nipples need to be stained too in order for it to work. If they only nurse on one side, get another qtip and dip it into the solution and stain your other nipple. It's best to use this at night and if you can, don't even wear a bra to sleep because like I said, it stains. You can use it for up to 4 days in a row. If it persists, wait 3 days and start over. Make sure that the baby doesn't have thrush down in the diaper area because you'll need to apply some sort of antifungal cream down there as well.

Good luck.|`|3750ee6f375e03c4e0940225b2f654e5aa	I would go to your regular doctor to confirm the pregnancy then set up an appointment with your OB/GYN.  I'm not sure how hard it is to get an appointment with your OB but there is about a 2-4 week wait at the practice I go to so don't put it off!|`|41f3f511fdae8607c1e4c4ccb58ae109aa	You need to find an OB-GYN.<br>  This will be the doctor that delivers your baby, so ask around for good referrals and choose wisely.<br>  Your first appointment will be very thorough, they will order blood work, perform a pap, check vitals, etc.<br>  Congratulations!|`|6812fd28dc0baa330987b31a1db93281aa	well i am 5 months pregnant so you need to got to a womens clinic first. they will give you a pregnancy test then if you are pregnant they will set you up with a doctor. hope every thing works out for you.|`|730f099db6b6519341e7aa457b5b0befaa	you go to a ob/gyn. the regular doctor will just send you to one anyways so i wouldn't waste your time going to your regular doctor unless you want them to refer you to someone. just be sure that the one you get, you are completely satisfied with because it is very important for you to feel comfortable throughout you're entire pregnancy and you should't be ashamed to ask any questions. the ob/gyn i have is not all that great. i mean he knows what he's doing but he has a totally dry personality and doesn't act like he is willing to take the time with his patients and discuss things. he just answers my questions and tells me what's gonna happen at my next visit. he has no sense of humor. he's kind of like the actor ben stein. if you know who that is, then you can picture my doctor. lol. so just be sure you're happy with who you have.|`|83b1d4f1d6b37c4020907874bf3a9bd5aa	Yes make an appointment with the OB. Tell them that you are pregnant and they will do all the stuff that you need to "verify" that you are pregnant. Then after that they will tell you everything that you need to know about being pregnant and when you have to go to the doctor. Congratulations!!!! And GOD bless|`|8f5cdbb620c5dc4ec50e46b43bf0a233aa	I was unsure too at first. I didn't have a Gyno because my fertility doctor was also my Gyno and I wasn't going to her anymore. So, I went to my primary doctor. She recommended an OB, but that OB was so booked that she wouldn't be able to see for about a month and a half; therefore, I didn't go to her even though she was highly recommended by my primary doc. I just did my research and found someone who took my insurance and got lucky. My OB is GREAT!<br>  <br>  Good luck and CONGRATULATIONS! w00t w00t!|`|ee8db01be3679436efb66d4c0242f838aa	You should go to see OB to make sure everything is ok CONGRATULATIONS!!!!|`|AA11745306	Yes, you'll want to see a gynocologist or even a general practitioner. They will do a bunch of tests to check your blood type, check for anemia, STD's, stuff like that. They will also give you a prescription for prenatal vitamins because you need to start taking those right away! Congrats!|`|ad0c0311c4f5070a645ec25543a7a6bdaa	Depends. Does your insurance require referrals? Then you might want to get one from your general practicioner. <br>  <br>  Normally, I would just look up who was on my insurance list and then call one and make an appointment. I never got in before 9-10 weeks along though.

AA10257174	Your stature does not in any way determine whether you will experience difficulties in childbirth. While it's true that larger people tend to have larger babies, the female body is made to accomodate even larger babies - the pelvis flexes outward to allow the head to pass through, and unformed bone plates in the baby's head condense and overlap to allow it to squeeze through the narrow opening. This is true whether the mother is large or petite, whether the baby is five pounds or ten pounds.<br>  <br>  I'm big boned and overweight, and gave birth vaginally to an 8 1/2 pound baby with no complications whatsoever. My petite friend couldn't push out her 7 1/2 pound baby and had to have a C-section. I've met others whose stories are just the opposite. In the end, every woman and every pregnancy is unique - it's impossible to speculate beforehand what the end result will be.|`|AA10135406	have you every seen a skelton with big bones????|`|1d2e543532e81a54e1b121107395400daa	Bigger boned people are more likely to have a larger baby or babies when compared to a petite or smaller person.  Another factor is the father-not just the size of the mother.  If your baby was born large or on the larger side than this probably why you needed to have a C-section.  Being morbidly obese or overweight adds high-risk issues to an individuals pregnancy. Not just a couple of pounds overweight but you know what I mean.  However, being big boned is a different situation all together.

791NVofcaa	i had bloody show and irregular contractions for 5 days before my water broke. your body goes at it's own pace. your doctor will hopefully be able to answer more questions for you tomorrow. and if he does a cervical sweep (you can request it!) it might kick start active labor. just keep an eye on the contractions and as soon as they get regular at 5 minutes apart, head to the hospital! good luck!|`|AA11795652	I had the brown stringy stuff and my doctor said it was my mucus plug and the cervix getting thinner.  She was happy about it saying that I was getting more effaced (not necessarily dilated yet).  Still wait until the contractions are close together and regular.  Congrats, you're almost there!|`|ZP6fNAZdaa	I have heard that when you begin to see bloody show.. its a sign of in depth labor. :) so.. maybe you should contact your OBGYN. <br>  <br>  Congratulations!|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I would think 2 days is normal. Congrats!|`|7a21abcf50668faa413ff2b682d8ddc2aa	first baby? I know i lost my mucous plug 2 weeks before actually going into labor. if you are concerned about the bleeding..call the doctor...they might want you to go in. My contractions never regulated and where 3 mins apart, then 5, then 2, then 7 etc.  if your contractions are not going away when walking, that's a pretty good indication that you in labor. I'd call the doc, she what they say! sometimes labor can last for days....|`|FEzmVmFjaa	Kinda sounds like what I'm going through! I lost a HUGE mucus plug last week, then friday I was 2-3 cm dilated. Sat. had a HUGE bloody show, and since then I've had brownish pink stringy discharge that comes and goes.. mostly in the mornings. I have been having REALLY bad contractions, last night I was in slow labor and it is now stalled. I am PISSED! lol. They got to be 4.5-5 mins. apart, and depends on your hospital when they will want you to come in. i would call and ask, I am supposed to wait till mine are 2-3 mins. apart. The discharge and bloody show and all that DO mean you're finishing your dilation and effacing, so it DEF. sounds like labor will be any min. i would also call and ask about your contractions, my nurse said they ARE NOT BH if they worsen when you walk, so you're probably having the real thing.. GOOD LUCK!|`|SRzswqTeaa	Your mucous plug will continue to come out and rebuild until the baby is born.  So yes, it can be normal to have it for two days, and even more.  It does not mean that you are dilating more, but you might be.  When the contractions come consistently, even when you are lying down, and they last at least 45 seconds - you are getting closer.  Walking can make 'false labor' stronger, and bring them closer together, but if you stop, they will eventually piddle out.  So when do you go in?::<br>  <br>  1)if your water breaks<br>  2) significant bleeding (like a pad in an hour)<br>  3) when contractions are 45 seconds to a minute long<br>  4) When the contractions have been coming for a few hours, and have become longer, stronger and closer together.  Head out when they are around 5-10 minutes apart.  <br>  5)Or if you just feel like things are moving faster than they should.

txSiQc7Waa	Ok, I'm assuming that you aren't on any other types of birth control? Sperm definitely could have leaked out and that means that you could very well be pregnant. Sperm can live for up to 5 days so if you were ovulating anytime after the condom slip up, it makes your chances for pregnancy even greater. Implantation can occur anywhere from 5 - 14 days past ovulation. The bleeding you experienced could have been implantation, or it might just be your cycle acting funny. Your best bet is to wait until at least the day your period is due, and take a hpt. <br>  <br>  I take it that you don't want to be pregnant so I thought I would add that an average, healthy, "completely trying to have a baby" couple only has a 25% chance of conceiving. So the odds are in your favor. Good luck to you and I hope this helps.|`|iO3BLRTYaa	it would have been a great idea the day after this happened that you went and got the morning after pill, but i'm assuming you didn't.<br>  i'm also assuming that you're not on any other type of birth control, so now that it's so late in the day (10 days after) the only  thing you can do is wait till your periods due and take a test.<br>  <br>  the things you have said about the brown and cramps sound like implantation but they could also be a lot of other things, cramps could be anything and the brown could be old blood from a previous period. it could also be from having sex since this incident.<br>  <br>  next time, if this happens again, go the dr or chemist and get a morning after pill and get yourself on the pill or something like that just for extra back up.<br>  <br>  there's nothing worse that an unplanned pregnancy when the couple ends up splitting up cos neither was ready for a family, it's the child you have to think of and whether you can provide for it yourself without having to rely on the government like what others do which is not right. if you can't provide for a child, then don't have a child.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|xwZKouCIaa	there is always a possibility that some sperm leaked out of the condom, remember that sperm are microscopic and it only take 1 itty bitty sperm to get pregnant being as tho your were ovulating that week your best bet would be to wait and see if you have a missed period. because it sounds like you might of had some implantation bleed.. but try to to worry about it too much cause the anxiety may cause your period to be late..  just wait and see if you have a missed period then test... then take it from there but if u test and your period still doesnt come for lets say another week or so then go to your doctor and see what's up.. hope this helps good luck to you
AA12145826	I panic when holding an aerosol can. Seriously. They're highly combustible and I avoid them whenever I can. I'm afraid they're going to explode in my hand....its never happened before, but who's to say that it won't? (I know its silly....stop laughing! LoL)<br>  <br>  I also have a hard time with stairs with no back on the risers. For example, I would have a hard time with these beautifully designed stairs: <a href="http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://dustbowl.files.wordpress.com/2007/11/modern_stairs_vc_03.jpg&imgrefurl=http://dustbowl.wordpress.com/2007/11/28/nice-stairs/&h=340&w=512&sz=21&tbnid=OWQ07hxjM_QjHM::&tbnh=87&tbnw=131&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dstairs&hl=en&usg=__zlkIe6kLqJmwoImeEuJUPfoQgfI=&ei=lI-lSeXqDuCbtweFjZXWBA&sa=X&oi=image_result&resnum=3&ct=image&cd=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http...</a> because they have no backing and my foot could slip causing me to get my leg caught up in between the stairs and it could break horribly.

pXSKSS3daa	Unfortunately in today's society many people view a woman's breasts as something sexual rather than what they are really intended for. It's sad. Breastfeeding is a wonderful way of bonding with your baby and too many people view it as something "disgusting".<br>  <br>  Then you get those mothers that are self conscious anyway and they hear these comments and get the thoughts put into their head so they are nervous about feeding their baby, when in reality they are doing something VERY natural.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry people have spoken badly to you, but congratulations on nursing your son this long and good luck with nursing him longer.|`|iH2whFkHaa	Because breasts are so over sexualized these days they can't understand the concept of breasts being for something other than sexual purposes. Therefore breastfeeding is nasty because in their mind they are doing something sex related with the baby. It's not really a conscious thought and it's not anyone's fault that they would feel this way; it's a very subtle connection made by the subconscious mind that might make someone feel that it would be disgusting. It's very rude to comment on other people's decisions about it like that though.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	people criticize that which they do not know. i was a formula feeding mommy (not by choice i couldn't produce enough) but i still FULLY understand the benefit of breastfeeding and that the longer you do it the better. people only make dumb comments like that when they do not understand. it's as simple as that.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	I dont know! I wasn't opposed to breastfeeding, but I wasn't really fond of it. Since I had gestational diabeties i decided i would try it for 6 weeks and then quit, six weeks came and i was on the floor crying because i didnt want to stop. I ended up breastfeeding until she was 13 months old!|`|acj9mB9Paa	My son is 21 months (we are also trying to "make it" until he is two) and nurses once a day still.  These women have never breast fed a child or they would KNOW that there is NO sexual pleasure derived from nursing!  But in westernized countries we are taught that breasts are for sexual pleasure and selling stuff.  Most women are not taught that breasts are intended MAINLY to nourish our children with the BEST food possible.  In less industrialized countries it is not rare at all to see someone nursing her child.<br>  <br>  I am a hard core nursing fanatic and my views are not well received, but I DARE someone to make a comment to me!!!  I have done my research and KNOW the facts and am not scared or embarrassed to let the whole world know how I feel!!  (I think I embarrass others sometimes though....lol).  I am SO lucky to have a husband and in-laws that support my extended breast feeding so I don't cause problems with in the family.|`|oUtEVKDHaa	At first I thought It was gross. But I didn't have a child before. I thought that it would "feel" gross you know. I thought the nipple area is just too sensitive for that. so when I got pregnant I said no breastfeeding for me. Everyone thought I was being stupid I said sorry it's not for me. but then my baby came. I saw her and I was still saying no. well after hours of her not eating I felt bad because she didn't want to take the bottle. I said give her to me!! and she ATE on my boob. it didn't feel nasty OR weird it felt like something i had been doing forever. I loved boding with my daughter. It was great! now i she's 7 months and I'm still doing it. going for the year but if she still wants it i'll give it to her. i mean she loves it so why take that away you know.. you did a good job letting the baby self wean I am planning on doing that too. I have a friend who always asks me "so how does it feel?" she thinks it feels the same as when your husband/bf "is there" you know.. that's why i think people think of it as sexual but i tell her no it's completely different and with my experience i think you have to live it to really know!! but now i think it's the best thing you can do. if you don't do it it's ok too!|`|mVD3TQkFaa	Because people are ignorant sometime. That is too bad that you had to get comments like that. I tried breastfeeding and wish so badly I would have stuck with it. Kudos to you for nursing your little one it is best. I will be breastfeeding number 2 for sure when he/she comes along now that I know a little more about it and what to expect.|`|5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	Some people are just naturally stupid. There were 7 of us children in my family and my mom breastfed all of us, sometimes in public. My mom did NOT suffer these fools in silence. If they made a comment, she let them have it in return. The people who make comments and try to restrict this are the same ones who are ashamed of the naked form in sculpture and oil paintings and who would put pants on Michaelangelo's David and a dress on the Venus Di Milo...|`|2MKvrydWaa	i feel the same way.if i say i'm feeding my baby breast milk i hear the comments"why do you want 2 do that","ewwww that's nasty","i couldn't do that if i were u".and many more.i may have stopped exclusively breastfeeding b/c i only do it at night if that but i still think it is a great and naturally beautiful thing 2 do for your child.|`|BUXC2Kz0aa	Eeeewww How could they think that..thats because there are some sad individuals out there posting stuff on the web about it and they should keep their opinions to themselves...probably have nothing else to do SADDOS!! Hats off to you if you managed to feed your son for that long...it's every mummies choice how long they feed and sometimes they don't even have a choice cuz they can't do it!! So if I were you I'd hold my head up high and take no notice...I think most moms would agree you did a good job :-)|`|T0gv52CDaa	Society has become very sexuallized, and people tend to forget that nourishing a child is the primary purpose for breasts.  Also, I've noticed that some people see me breastfeeding my child as a personal indictment against themselves for not having breastfed their own children.  While I admitt that I don't understand how anyone who has ever smelled or tasted formula could feed it to their child, I don't say things like that out loud to formula feeding mothers, so I think their feeling like I'm attacking their choice is just their own guilty feelings talking.
SRzswqTeaa	Yep, it's normal.  Lots of hormones surging right now, and goo coming out of nowhere all the time!  I have to wear a liner during my whole pregnancy.. I'm just a goo makin' machine!  lol|`|d1df7701087311fcf1008982d372a396aa	At 30 weeks i don't think it's your mucus plug, i think it's a bit early, but the discharge thing happened to me with my first pregnancy too. It's just part of the whole "pregnancy glow" (lol) i think...If you're still concerned you should call your obgyn to clear any doubts.|`|AA10230627	it's completely normal. have has this twice before and going thru it now with my 3rd pregnancy. it's just your body produces more fluids due to increased blood flow to your pelvis.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I have the same thing.|`|T0r5hofiaa	You are normal.No worries!|`|AV6jpU3eaa	If it's just the creamy discharge, it's called leukorrhea.  It should be odourless or maybe mild-smelling.  Very common during pregnancy.  It's because of estrogen increase.  You will have more of this discharge when you're closer to labour.  I have been using panty liners for the last 2 months because of this.<br>  <br>  If you have discharge and itchiness, it may be yeast infection (also common during pregnancy), you should check with your doctor and have him/her prescribe you some medication.|`|haabfMtkaa	You are NOT ALONE this is very normal your body just getting ready. Don't be surprised if it doesn't go away after the baby. I am 30 and have never had so much wetness in my life. I've talked with my girlfriends about it and it seems to be common.|`|7a21abcf50668faa413ff2b682d8ddc2aa	completly normal! it's called leukerhea or something like that. if's supposed to be creamy white or clear. as long as it doesn't smell then it's fine. I have to wear liners from the very beginning of my pregnancys.|`|SBjXCRIAaa	yes, i jokes with my last one..i dont know if i wet my pants, am sweating, or if my water just broke.|`|utfoP7GWaa	I have the same thing and I'm 27.4 weeks!
C4ibOR7Laa	no no of course not, my sister had exactly the same thing happen, she was pregnant and her smear was abnormal, she kept bleeding all the way through her pregnancy really scared something was awfully wrong, after she had the baby itwasn'tt that bad, but had treatment, got the all clear, and now is pregnant again and due in july|`|f84b2b45d58a6539dd190e931fdc5a32aa	I've had 2 children since having treatment for pre-cancerous cells, and didnt have any problems conceiving, so good luck<br>  xxx|`|jhPlVj0oaa	Hi there,<br>  Yes, I have and am hoping to again.  I had two loop treatments done for pre-cancerous cells and conceived fairly easily.  I understand there is a very small possibility that it can affect your chances of conceiving, but not in my case.<br>  Hope that helps.
z0Ynd4zRaa	Actually some of them are legal. I think it depends on how many children you're caring for. They do have to get something though. I'm not really sure 100% about all the details, but I know someone that is unlicensed, and it's allowed in certain cases.|`|9jcuYZgmaa	They get closed down!|`|OI29tkSoaa	Some can go to jail|`|EIzs2OWeaa	<a href="http://en.lmgtfy.com/?q=consequences+of+unlicensed+child+care" rel="nofollow">http://en.lmgtfy.com/?q=consequences+of+...</a><br>  lmao<br>  im sorry i really dont know|`|Mcr4IS6Vaa	Depends if they get caught then they get shut down by the health inspector.
fPCWhiZuaa	perchè avete rotto?kiedigli il motivo.. deve darti delle spiegazioni ne hai il diritto!se ti ha lasciata solo x farsi una vita nuova..signifika ke la "vekkia" cn te nn gli piaceva.. e allora nn devi neanke pensare di dimenticarlo..proprio SCORDALO uno scemo così...|`|b395093356ce16c6f23809f409b1e870aa	Indipendentemente dal fatto che è una pessima persona, proprio di quelle che io detesto e che purtroppo anche a me è capitato di incontrare, perchè anche se alla fine non serve a molto a chi viene lasciato, dovrebbe almeno avere il coraggio di spiegartene il perchè, peggio ancora se non gli va di parlarti perchè ormai è talmente disinteressato che si annoierebbe a doverti dare spiegazioni e ancor più ad ascoltare ciò che tu certamente vorresti dirgli.<br>  Purtroppo non credo ci sia una medicina per dimenticare, non subito almeno. Tra l'altro dipende dal tipo di persona che sei tu, mi spiego e ti faccio esempi in base ad esperienze mie personali o di miei/mie amici/che:<br>  1) C'è chi è talmente forte che si mette subito alla ricerca di qualcun altro e prima o poi trova quello/a giusto/a.<br>  2) C'è chi (ed in questo caso soprattutto le donne), specialmente se superano una certa età, si mette alla ricerca disperata di un partner e ti faccio un esempio nell'esempio: avevo un'amica che se perdeva la testa per uno veramente sopportava di tutto. Questa amica aveva avuto una storia per un decennio credo con un tipastro che gliene ha fatte di tutti i colori, tra le altre cose la lasciava quando gli pareva, ma poi tanto per dirtene una, quando lei si sforzò di mettersi con un altro e lui lo venne a sapere, gli chiese di tornare con lui e lei prontamente lo fece.<br>  Poi abbe un'altra storia, durata otto anni con un altro pessimo elemento, non puoi immaginare cosa non abbia sopportato! Quando però lui la lasciò per sempre, avendo superato i trenta, volendo crearsi una famiglia, ma soprattutto avere dei figli prima che fosse troppo tardi, pur essendo una donna seria, si buttava con chiunque e non ti dico che "donna facile" era diventata, fin quando non ha trovato un uomo col quale sta tuttora.<br>  3) C'è poi una terza categoria di persone, quella a cui malauguratamente appartengo io, ovvero di quelle che non riescono, pur provandoci a dimenticare chi amano, a meno che non sia il Fato a farle innamorare di qualcun altro.<br>  Non sto a raccontarti tutte le mie storie, perchè sarebbe lungo, ma per farti comprendere meglio ti dirò delle ultime due:<br>  Ho avuto una storia durata 16 anni, finita non per colpa mia.<br>  Ho povato a cambiare partner. Ho avuto persone diverse e che veramente mi volevano bene, ma dopo un pò non le sopportavo accanto e chiudevo la storia. Continuavo a pensare sempre alla stessa persona. Pensavo al suicidio etc..., quando un bel giorno conobbi qualcuno che mi fece perdere la testa. Ero felice, ma purtroppo dopo poco più di un anno ho avuto ben pochi motivi per esserlo. Non puoi immaginare cosa non ho subito!. Poi il 23 dicembre del 2005, dopo 5 anni d'inferno ci siamo lasciati per sempre.<br>  E' passato più di un anno e mezzo che non ho più sue notizie, ma è ancora nella mia mente, anche se (e questa è un'altra delle cose che però voglio aggiungere), man mano che passa il tempo ci soffro meno, anche se so che mi basterebbe pure un solo incontro per farmi perdere di nuovo la testa.<br>  Spero tu non appartenga a quest'ultima categoria, ma se così fosse: non disperare, perchè l'amore giunge quando meno te lo aspetti.<br>  In bocca al lupo!|`|mBD5L8gnaa	all inizio starai male.. ma qndo incontrerai

xbgY7jZ5aa	Si, esce il liquido pre-eiaculatorio, che molto difficilmente può causare gravidanze, però se avete tenuto le mutande, allora è pressochè impossibile. L'importante è che gli organi non siano venuti a contatto o che non ci sia stata penetrazione! Mi spiego meglio<br>  Quando l'uomo ha un orgasmo, gli organi genitali non devono venire in contatto (a meno che ci sia profilattico).<br>  Se invece gli organi si sfiorano senza avere nessun orgasmo (maschile) o troppa eccitazione (potrebbe uscire il pre-eiaculatorio che non viene avvertito) allora non succede niente.<br>  Spero di essere stata chiara.<br>  Se hai bisogno.. ciao!|`|1iGv3ZO5aa	stai tranquilla, non c'è stata penetrazione, quindi è impossibile!!!!|`|CHGrzEyGaa	Tranquilla non è successo nulla.

zWxvw2wQaa	Try slowing down with that formula or don't give him as much as you usually do for his regular feedings. He's 3 months old...you CAN begin to give him small (very small) amounts of rice cereal. DON'T USE A FEEDER THOUGH! When my daughter was that young, she started needing more to eat. Mix like 1 TBS. of rice cereal with 1 1/2 TBS. of formula. Make it so that it's runny, but not so runny that you can't keep it on a spoon. If you don't want to do it like that, you can put 1 1/2 tsp. in a bottle, but you'll have to either make a very very small cut in his nipple or buy a fast flow nipple or two. Teething probably has quite a bit to do with this because the sucking action makes his mouth feel better. Will he take a paci? If so, give it to him. Otherwise, I would say keep him to a minimum with the feedings. Don't starve him, but you know what I mean. Just make sure you're not putting a bottle in his mouth everytime he cries. Give him a toy or try to distract him. Give him something to chew on. If he can't hold it in his mouth to chew, hold it for him. This will probably help too. Good luck.|`|bc7e0ec8c3bc5dbc9ec1cdd56e6ebe81aa	At around 3 months most babies hit a growth spurt and go through a few days of increased appetite.  This may be the cause for your son drinking more lately.  He may be thirsty because of the heat outside too.  Just make sure that he's actually hungry when you feed him.  Some babies will drink way more than they need if you keep offering it.  If he's crying check to see if he's crying for other reasons first (soiled diaper, too hot, too cold, uncomfortable clothing, over stimulated, and the big one - tired).  If you're sure he's actually hungry then feed him.  If his weight gain is way out of the range of normal I'd consult with your Dr. about this.|`|md5yjbDiaa	He's doing fine, I did feed on demand also and worked out good for the both of us. He's too young for water right now so you should avoid it altogether.

Déle algo para hacer con las manos sin mencionar su inquietud porque chupa dedo. De vez en cuando elógielo por no chupar dedo.

1VZYryW2aa	When she's that young, definitely. She probably has anemia (a shortage of iron or hemoglobin) which makes a person look paler. With a sudden change in diet like, one with little iron to one that has a lot (or vice versa), could easily change her complexion at a young age like that. When she gets older, if she has a steady supply of iron in her food, it will even out her skin tone. You can even give her iron pills. <br>  <br>  But when she gets older it'll be harder to change her skintone by her diet.

MjFQoLFcaa	Come prima cosa ti consiglio gli assorbenti interni TAMPAX, e non gli OB... TAMPAX COMPACT.... devi inserire la platica fino all estramita, in una posizione in cui i muscoli non sono tesi...ti consiglio di stare  seduta...quando ti senti pronta premi e fai entrare L'assorbente, che sta dentro il tubetto di plastica che avevi inserito... se è stato inserito bene nn dovresti sentire niente, come se non lo avessi nemmeno. Dovresti lasciare il filicino fuori x poi estrarre l assorbente,ke  in genere va tolto dopo 3 ora se il flusso è normale. Stai attenta a non lasciarlo x ttanto tempo xk potresti prendere delle infezioni.   Baci|`|23f51b5df31399bdf28498b9016f3b23aa	Certo che puoi usarlo anche se sei vergine.<br>  Forse avrai qualche difficolta' le prime volte, ma poi vedrai quanto e' comodo.<br>  Leggi bene le istruzioni, e compra quelli con gli applicatori, che sono piu' facili da mettere.<br>  Puo' essere tenuto per un tempo di solito non superiore alle 4-5 ore (per motivi igienici), ma poi dipende dal tuo flusso (te ne accorgi da sola quando e' il momento di cambiarlo).|`|5a7732fe64223dc3ade28cf36ae6c346aa	beh guarda...io l'ho usato l'anno scorso...ma nn ero vergine...non so...forse sarebbe meglio non usarlo se nn 6 vergine...ma cmq...puoi fare 1 cosa...metti il costume kn 1 assorbente normale e poi metti 1 pantaloncino da sopra...io lo faccio sempre xD!!!|`|ArdazsrVaa	io li uso regolarmente e mi trovo benissimo....si si può usare anche se sei vergine senza problemi.... in piscina è molto utile perchè è discreto.. e più o meno dipende dal flusso ma un paio di ore lo puoi tenere tranquillamente...|`|EZ1WuAsXaa	allora se compri i tampax mini si puoi usarli...poi per il tempo dipende dal flusso....se è abbondante non più di due ore se è normale 3,4 ore mentre se è poco anche 5 ore baci piccolina comunque quando li compri nell'istruzioni c'è scritto tutto|`|l6zn2Cu8aa	sì che lo puoi usare, ma il formato Mini e con quello puoi andare in piscina tranquuillamente.Non tenerlo troppe ore però, a lungo andare ad alcune da dei problemi...Sii serena e vai a farti una bella nuotata..|`|zlKmo5Fvaa	Gli assorbenti interni sono comodi e utili, soprattutto in spiaggia e in piscina. Anche le ragazze vergini possono usarli, ci sono gli appositi formati "mini". Io uso i tamponi da quando avevo 14 anni, d'estate sono indispensabili ma anche di inverno sono comodi, pratici e igienici. Per la scelta del tipo: io ho usato gli OB per anni, poi sono passata ai tampax perche' l'uso dell'applicatore rende l'operazione piu' igienica e pratica, per me. Ti consiglio di comprare una confezione dell'uno e dell'altro e di scegliere quello che trovi migliore. All'interno della confezione c'e' un foglietto che ti spiega per filo e per segno come vanno usati, comunque  dovresti cambiarlo al massimo dopo 4 ore. Ciao e tranquilla! :)|`|ztBUlfUOaa	io ho 17 anni e non l'ho mai usato,da quel che dicono,si puo' usare ANCHE se sei vergine,ma meglio di no,visto che sarebbe piu' difficoltoso inserirlo.....meglio aspettare...|`|zawKhZCHaa	uh cosa vuoi che sia.. è solo un assorbente.. pensa che io l'ho dimenticato su x 1 notte.. nn lo senti neanche.. e nn mi è successo nulla.. certo ero in fine ciclo e nn avevo molto flusso quindi nn mi sono macchiata.. se hai il flusso intenso ti conviene metterti un salva slip sotto in modo da stare sicura.. e x la piscina vai tranquilla è xfetto.. eh attenta che nn si veda il filetto sotto il costume o che nn venga fuori.. Anch'io sn vergine e nn ho riscontrato problemi.. la prima volta che l'ho messo c'era una mia amica fuori dal bagno che mi faceva "supporto morale" e che mi diceva un Po come fare..|`|xMrX5O05aa	Certo, l'imene è una membrana elastica che non si lacera con un assorbente (altrimenti il cilo mestruale, ad esempio, la romperebbe, no? Per quanto concerne la piscina è ok e per la durata dipende dal tuo flusso. Il comfort è maggiore quqando l'assorebnte viene cambiato più volte.|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	`però cambialo spesso.....|`|9394223d7f6c4e2627db8de6d260ada6aa	ci sono quelli mini apposta!! in piscina non serve.. in acqua il ciclo si blocca...<br>  Ciao ciao =)|`|GWpkvaTPaa	Sono perfetti per la piscina e anche per qualunque altra attività sportiva! Le vergini possono usare il formato mini, che c'è sia negli OB che nei Tampax, e che è fatto apposta per le giovanissime ma comodo, nei giorni di flusso leggero, anche per chi vergine non è più. Gli OB si inseriscono con un dito e quindi più facilmente, mentre i Tampax richiedono dimestichezza con l'applicatore, ma questo strumentino li rende anche più igienici. Gli OB si aprono in larghezza, i Tampax in lunghezza, quindi danno sensazioni diverse quando li hai dentro, a seconda della sensibilità individuale. Si possono tenere 4-5 ore e poi si tolgono tirando il cordoncino. Provali entrambi e decidi quali preferisci, io ho fatto così e alla fine ho scelto i Tampax. Buon divertimento!|`|iLxrVdWBaa	Sì lo puoi usare però con molta cautela... Io l'ho usato solo ultimamente quindi non ho avuto questo problema della verginità, però molte mie amiche sono anni che lo usano e con cautela non succede niente... Il tipo lo devi scegliere a seconda delle tue necessità ovvero del flusso che hai...la marca ti consiglio i tampax dato che c'è un funzionale applicatore... io uso i mini per esempio però ci sono anche i regular e quelli per chi ha un flusso più abbondante...Il tempo che lo puoi tenere è soggettivo... io massimo ma proprio massimo 3 ore... perché in estate vado in spiaggia...<br>  In piscina lo puoi usare tranquillamente però ti conviene prima sperimentarlo magari quando sei a casa per un po' di ore e fai molta attenzione quando lo applichi...<br>  Ciao!!!|`|pJ9jozfdaa	LO PUOI METTERE BENISSIMO PER ANDARE IN PISCINA<br>  E POI NON SUCCEDE NIENTE SE SEI VERGINE<br>  PUOI ANKE FARE I BISOGNI CHE NON SUCCEDE NIENTE<br>  BUONA NUOTATA CIAO

Ora sto con un altro ragazzo con il quale sto benissimo ma lui è più grande di me ed ha altre cose a cui pensare quindi a volte lo sento più distante o freddo perchè è stanco per il lavoro o altre cose sue...ma dopo che gli è passato il periodo o i giorni no torna quello che era prima..dolce e affettuoso..ed è così che deve essere! Se il tuo lui dopo un pò lo senti ancora freddo e distaccato allora devi prendere una decisione...restare con lui e farsi sempre questa domanda e starci male o tornare ad essere si sola ma libera dalla tristezza e dalle paure?? Pensaci bene e buona fortuna mia cara! =) Spero che sia solo un periodo no e che gli passi (anche perchè è vero che lui ti dice che va tutto bene..ma loro nn si accorgono mai che si stanno allontanado..lo capiamo noi che siamo più sensibili)<br>  Baci|`|d9XjaKmraa	Eh ma parlaci no?...Se fa il difficile prendilo di petto.<br>  Io farei così...odio quando devo parlare con qualcuno e questo non mi ascolta perchè pensa di avere ragione.

"Purtroppo" i bambini non arrivano a comando, arrivano solo quando "vogliono loro". Quindi, se tu ed il tuo compagno non avete problemi (gli accertamenti si fanno dopo 1 anno che tentate e non ci riuscite....4 mesi sono davvero pochi.), l'unica cosa e' rilassarsi e non avere il chiodo fisso. E' piu' facile a dirsi che farsi, ma l'ansia e la psiche influisce molto su queste cose. Quindi un consiglio e' di andare in vacanza e rilassarvi. Il secondo consiglio che dicono anche i medici e' di non farlo tutti i giorni, ma a giorni alternati, altrimenti si indeboliscono gli spermatozoi.

Tutto corre più velocemente, vedo bambini che sanno cose e scoprono sentimenti che noi abbiamo scoperto alle medie. Mio figlio fa' la seconda e i suoi amici oltre a sapere quasi tutto sul sesso già percepiscono la diversità che c'è tra maschi e femmine. Anche i discorsi normali o le loro sensazioni sono troppo avanti, mi stupisco nel sentire un bambino che parla di depressione o che in un momento di rabbia grida che vuole sparire,a quell'età non è l'unico problema il gioco? Forse siamo noi genitori che ci dimentichiamo di aver accanto un fanciullo e vogliamo farli crescere troppo in fretta, o forse è il mondo che ora corre troppo velocemente.|`|9p0Q3ta1aa	ma secondo me succede alle persone a cui la famiglia nn cosidera + di tanto, ha dei ragazzi abbandonati a se stessi|`|Q0g9E6fBaa	si hai assolutissimamente ragione....io ho 23 anni e vedo le ragazzine di 13 14 anni che se la tirano in una maniera impossibile...non ti dico qua dove abito io quante ragazzine di 14 anni sono rimaste incinte....non vorrei essere nei loro panni...si ritroveranno con una brutta reputazione quando cresceranno...a allora si renderanno conto del grande sbaglio che hanno fatto!!!!|`|jro1y7VUaa	diciamo che l'adolescienza loro l'hanno a 10 anni. conosco alcune persone che hanno fatto sesso a 12 anni è inamissibile !<br>  <br>  cmq anche io l'ho notato. grazie anche alle trasmissioni come lucignolo. complimenti tv italiana io la brucerei|`|lq2HF4D3aa	concordo...non esiste piu' l'adolescenza, ma da bambino diventi "grande", adulto. Credo che sia un peccato perchè vengono ignorate molte cose e molti valori, si passa dalla festa di compleanno in giardino alla serata in discoteca....|`|r1MlpTJSaa	Ma cosa si intende per età adulta?<br>  Un attimo scusate...<br>  per voi essere adulti vuol dire essere nell'età giusta per poter fare sesso e uscire a ballare in discoteca?<br>  Ma chi va in discoteca è davvero adulto?<br>  Secondo me no.<br>  Sesso?<br>  Quando si è potenziali donne e potenziali uomini è legittimo poter fare sesso. La maturità mentale è un'altra cosa. A PARTE PROPRIO.<br>  Solo che attualmente la maturità sessuale e la maturità mentale vengono confuse sempre più... e questo non può che portare ad ulteriori disagi, non solo per i giovani ma anche per gli "adulti".<br>  Facciamo di tutta l'erba un fascio, ma non è così.<br>  Se imparassimo a discernere i vari aspetti che caratterizzano i giovani, senza fare troppa confusione e senza trarre giudizi e conclusioni affrettati forse questi problemi si potrebbero anche arginare in qualche modo.<br>  E' vero, il consumismo, la pubblicità, l'industria, la politica, lo spettacolo... senza dire che siano cose essenzialmente negative, perché se sono nate un giusto movente c'è stato comunque (nate e poi degenerate)... rendono tutto più difficile e complicato da affrontare.<br>  Ma secondo me. E' anche la fiducia che manca.<br>  La fiducia in noi.<br>  Perché? Perché vediamo un mondo che va a p.....e, un mondo in cui i giovani si stanno "rovinando".<br>  Ma davvero è solo per il consumismo, l'industria, lo spettacolo e tutte quelle cose lì che i ragazzi sono così sperduti?<br>  E' la famiglia, giusto? La famiglia che è la prima scuola, il primo posto di lavoro, la prima "discoteca", il primo ristorante, il primo luogo con cui veniamo in contatto.<br>  E allora. Se le feste in casa sono come se fossero in discoteca che colpa ne hanno i giovani di avere il desiderio di andarci?<br>  O ancora meglio. L'assoluto contrario!<br>  Una casa troppo stretta.<br>  Una casa dove non c'è nessuna luce colorata. Dove non c'è musica. Dove non c'è divertimento.<br>  Una casa che è come un carcere. Che colpa ne hanno i giovani di avere il desiderio di scappare?<br>  Ora io parlo di colpe. Ma in realtà non è colpa di nessuno.<br>  Solo che, la maturità non viene solo dall'età anagrafica. E non sono geni i ragazzi più maturi del normale.<br>  Sono solo ragazzi più consapevoli. Che sanno di più.<br>  Sanno chi sono e come sono, conoscono le loro possibilità, i pro e i contro e hanno la possibilità di poter scegliere la propria strada sia essa giusta o sbagliata. Perché?<br>  Perché i genitori sono stati sinceri. Prima con se stessi e poi con i propri figli.<br>  Non importa come. Ma sono stati onesti. Onesti in ciò che pensavano e credevano giusto per i propri figli.<br>  I giovani vogliono SAPERE, CONOSCERE. E' un comportamento innato nell'uomo, ancor di più nel bambino e poi nel ragazzo. E se nessuno li soddisfa... sono costretti a farlo a modo loro. Anzi. Siamo costretti.<br>  Prima... gli adulti ascoltavano poco i giovani.<br>  Oggi li fanno parlare troppo, ma senza ascoltarli davvero.<br>  Le richieste sono solo mezzi.<br>  Una domanda può ricevere una risposta. Ma se la domanda nasconde una supplica, non sempre la risposta porta l'aiuto pregato e sperato.<br>  Un punto d'incontro. Fra giovani e adulti. Ma se nessuno è davvero disposto ad ascoltare non si può fare.<br>  E' come l'amore. "Ama il prossimo tuo come te stesso". Ma se non amiamo noi stessi e ci prendiamo in giro, ci illudiamo da mattina a sera... mi spiegate come potremo mai amare gli altri?

R0RnjdnXaa	I think it's normal. I felt the same way too I think we both did. But it doesn't mean you don't love each other. I guess it's just all that's going on and also you don't really have sex that often because it's uncomfortable and sometimes you just get a bit scared and feel your hurting the baby even though your not. Plus your hormones are going crazy too it'll go away and everything will be normal soon again...:)<br>  Take care|`|LFXTpqfdaa	Awww, poor guy... he just needs a little attention. Take him out to dinner or bring him a gift. I heard of a T-shirt for dads-to-be that says, "He Shoots, He Scores!" on it. See if you can find it and buy it for him.<br>  <br>  It's tough for guys when their lady is pregnant... they feel like their role in creating life is over. He needs a little coddling.<br>  <br>  My husband and I have this book, "Your Pregnancy, Week by Week", that has pictures and info about baby's development every week. We read the corresponding week's chapter out loud every Sunday. Then we listen to the baby's heartbeat with the stethoscope and feel her kick together. It's really great.<br>  <br>  Also rent The Miracle Of Life and watch that together. It's so amazing!|`|90zcKChJaa	Hubby and I are 14 weeks in, and in the first trimester we were pretty distant..emotionally and physically. I had absolutely no sex drive, so it made us a bit separated, but the pieces will fit back together soon enough. Hang in there and make sure communication is priority! ;)<br>  <br>  Best wishes and congrats!|`|AA10230627	all guys go thru this phase. their lives are changing once again. he's just gotten used to and comfortable with the first baby and now that the second one has went from a plan into existence he's tense. he's wondering if he has enough love and time for another child. you will go thru this stage too in your mind. it's not that he doesn't want the baby he's just questioning himself and in the end he'll come out of it.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	pregnancy can be an emotional rollercoaster for both parents, i would think that its perfectly normal to go through different phases of closesness throughout your whole marraige but especially during pregnancy.  my husband and i noticed that during this pregnancy we expected to feel the excitement and closeness we did with our first and because we have already been through it its not the same and we were a little down about it.  as long as you both recognize it and keep making an effort to stay close thats all that matters, things cant be perfect all of the time.|`|05bf614d400b126e98a6f037a990f73aaa	I would feel like your husband, its a man thing... Don't stress it... Congratulations!!!|`|CjwIAvuwaa	Hi, Me and my husband have experienced this aswell when i was about 8 weeks i went totally off sex and i also didn't like my husband cuddling me or touching me and everything he did annoyed me. This upset him and we sat down and spoke about it. We are getting on alot better now i know this isn't exactly the same but just keep at it and it will work itself out. Hope everything works out.<br>  Good luck on your pregnancy. x
oA8Rtyxuaa	I was induced 2 weeks prior to my due date, they used cervidil but I also had to be put on pitocin. Since you are overdue, your body might just need a little push so its hard to tell weather you will need pitocin too! Good luck!|`|9AHGuAEraa	I had to be induced at 38 weeks due to obstetric cholestasis and I started out with a thick cervix, and 1 cm dilated. They put in the Cervidil at 9:30 am on Saturday. I stayed an hour for monitoring then went home. I started contracting mildly at 11, and by 12:30 the contractions were stronger and coming 2-4 minutes apart. They got stronger and stronger until they were pretty strong (!) so I went back to the hospital. They took the Cervidil out at 2:30 b/c I wasn't dilating at all and was contracting too often and hard... I was still contracting hard every 2 minutes, which wore me out b/c I barely had any time to rest between contractions. It was also discouraging that after a day of contractions, I still hadn't dilated more than 1 cm. They took it out at 3 and told me to walk around (still contracting hard) for an hour to see if that would make me dilate... no luck so I went home. The contractions kept on till midnight, then I got some sleep because they got milder and further apart but I was still contracting mildly evry 10-15 minutes the next morning. When they checked me Sunday morning I was a 3 and my cervix was ripe, so I guess the contractions weren't for nothing, lol.  I got induced with Pitocin Sunday morning at 9:30, the OB broke my water at 12 (I think) and I delivered at 4:30 after 10 pushes. For me, the pain was actually easier to deal with on Sunday with the Pitocin because even though it was stronger, it came 4-5 minutes apart... so it seemed easier than less pain coming 2 minutes apart on Saturday. <br>  <br>  I was just talking to a friend who also had Cervidil, she wasn't dilated at all and the Cervidil made her go from 0 to 10 in just over an hour.The whole process took 2 1/2 hours and she delivered. That is pretty rare  but it can happen also. Her baby had also dropped since 37 weeks. <br>  <br>  Cervidil can be nasty, it can give you some nasty contractions that may or may not lead to labor. I have a feeling that for you it might be easier since you're already dilated. Is your cervix ripe? I assume it's not b/c that's what Cervidil is for. But you are farther along and your body is probably closer to being ready for labor. Have something to eat beforehand, and come to the hospital prepared to stay, just in case. It's likely that you will need Pitocin too, but you never know... Cervidil just might do it on its own. <br>  <br>  Good luck with everything, I hope your birth is easy and goes well!|`|rAkWoweOaa	No kidding honey, I feel your pain!! 1 day past is long enough!! lol. I was 2 weeks overdue and they gave me cervadil. It softened my cervix, but didn't make me dilate, so they used pitocin. Good Luck!!! Tomorrow will be the most exciting day of your life!!! : )|`|664f65654de0942122f1fdc6bc3b6675aa	When I was induced I was only 1 to 2 cm dilated and the cervidil worked for me.  It was inserted at 4pm and I had started contracting by 9pm.  I never needed pitocin but they did break my water early the next morning when I had dilated to 4cm.  My labor was progressing fine but the cord became compressed so I ended up with a c-section.|`|hrMhhB4Saa	i was induced 4 days past due and i went in at 7 at night. then inserted the cervadil. it's NOT ment to put you into labor... its ment to soften the cervix. well, 4am rolls around and im in labor. they still gave me pitocin at about 9am to get things moving along a little faster.  by 610pm my boy was here!|`|LhvKTYftaa	it didnt work for me.  I had to be put on the drip the next day.  Sorry I'm not much more help!!

v0596BTeaa	Sometimes you do get an extended bleed, or spotting, when you first start on birth control, especially the mini-pill which has low doses of hormones.  Give it another couple of months for your body to get used to the pill, and, if you are still having problems, go back to the doctor or clinic and as to try a different pill.|`|wPT33kEUaa	yes i had the implant put in my arm 9 months ago and had it removed today because for 5 months i had a constant period with only a 3 day break at the begining iv had soo many hospital visits and got kept in for bloody ages and doctors visits coz of it|`|AA11700363	I think u should call your doctor just to be on the safe side.

More than 3 weeks and something is not right...|`|3TdT5mG2aa	I have not tried the mini pill. I do know that it takes awhile for your body to get used to the medication. Within the next few months your periods will be out of whack. Once your body gets used to it, you should have a normal period, or a better period. I would ask your doctor about 12 days, though. That is a long time and it could result in losing too much blood. Good luck!|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Probably your body adjusting to the pill.  Possibly it's not for you.  I had many, many problems w/period especially during perimenopause (the 10 yrs. of so before real menopause)  I bled for 33 days -- want to talk about never-ending.  Sometimes it would stop for may 2 wks and start over again.  Go back to doctor and see if you need to be taking a different type of pill.|`|0rpN2419aa	I haven't had that problem, but if it continues, you can become anemic.  Call your Dr. if it doesn't stop soon and he may try you on a different prescription.|`|uuHPneEcaa	could be a side effect. if it doesn't stop in a few days call ur doctor.<br>  <br>  or maybe thats how it goes when u first start taking the pill then after that ur periods will be short and light and regular.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	yea i had my period for like a month .. ended up being hospitalized cuz i lost too much blood. so if it doesnt stop call ur doc

fohSd9SEaa	capita spesso che in alcuni cicli mestruali , non ci sia ovulazione, ma nel frattempo l'endometrio dell'utero,la parete per intenderci, si e' preparata lo stesso per ricevere un ipotetico ovulo fecondato. <br>  percio' non ricevendo nessun ovulo, ci sara' normalmente la mestruazione. baci sasy|`|9ze2lBe2aa	durante un ciclo anovulatorio, che significa per chi non lo sapesse e lo leggesse qui, un ciclo durante il quale non avviene l'ovulazione (rilascio dell'ovulo dall'ovaio), avviene una mestruazione normale, e solitamente può capitare durante la gravidanza (le cosiddette false mestruazioni) o quando ci si avvicina alla menopausa|`|f96K4psQaa	mitika Anna, cosi' ora so' qualcosa di piu'.......eh eh|`|wc8Sbnb8aa	Non si può distinguere da cicli ovulatori normali, la perdita di sangue non è diversa, però non puoi restare incinta perchè non viene prodotto l'ovulo.|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	grande anna...sei stata mooooooolto chiara.....
CSzDV3gEaa	can't tell for probably another week. in the mean time try to relax and get some pregnancy tests when your body can tell.|`|TPnDIaQEaa	You may not think it is a big deal, but this guy probably would want the truth. What if you do get pregnant? Then you will have to confess your lie and ultimately break down some of the trust between the two of you. Besides that, it is unfair to have him going into this believing that there is some extra protection from pregnancy. What if he would of said "no" if you told him the truth? He would probably be fairly upset once he hears the lie.<br>  <br>  If you are already a mother of one, you should know the signs of pregnancy. You should be able to determine for yourself whether or not there is a possibility. In fact, any sex = a possible pregnancy, as there is no such thing as "safe sex".<br>  <br>  Fess up your lie to the father and wait for a month or two.|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	First, why the hell did you lie about being on the pill? That's incredibly irresponsible.<br>  <br>  Second, why wouldn't there be a way for you to be pregnant? You had unprotected sex. Of course you can be pregnant. You already have a 2 year old? Gosh, maybe it's time for you to grow up before your baby does.|`|soFpywFcaa	hun if you had unprotected sex you can be pregnant try using protection and you wont have to worry|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	Yes. Why would you lie to him? Two of my best friends are 10 months apart because of this.|`|QSodlfMraa	too early to tell but it could happen.|`|jhPlVj0oaa	Oh dear lord....why on earth would you tell him you are on the pill for a start.  It's far too soon for you to have another baby, your body is not ready yet and if you are pregnant you will soon have 2 children under the age of 1.  Is this boyfriend your baby's father?  <br>  <br>  Yes, you could easily be pregnant, but of course you have choices in terms of whether you want to keep it or terminate the pregnancy.  Please, next time tell whoever you are sleeping with the truth about what contraception you are using..if any.<br>  <br>  I have a very liberal attitude to most things in life and would be fully supportive of single parents etc..but at the risk of sounding like a total prude...I think that lying about something like this is completely unacceptable and totally irresponsible.  We are talking about you possibly bringing another life into the world..because you couldn't be bothered to tell your boyfriend that you weren't taking precautions.  Are these the same principles that you will be teaching your children when they come to you for advice...''if in doubt, just lie about it."  Aaaagh, it makes my blood boil.|`|UkJU2ADcaa	Yeah, people do tell lies every now and then. But wtf would you say your on the pill for when you arent?? That is making him believe he doesnt have to be as cautious when in actuality he does. <br>  <br>  If you are pregnant, No matter how u see it, you set him up because you lied. What if he doesnt want another baby?|`|BHgtqH9Yaa	Why would you tell him you are on the pill if you aren't? That's very irresponsible. It is so easy to get pregnant after you give birth, so yes there is a good chance you could get pregnant. But it sound like that's what you want or you wouldn't have lied to him about being on the pill|`|jCB7S6sfaa	You may possible be. You are actually more fertile for the first 6 months after pregnancy. But also your body is still not use to the changes that they have gone through in the past 9 months. I could contact your obgyn if i were you|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	Why did you tell him you were on the pill when you weren't?<br>  If you are pregnant, that will be a nice surprise for him.<br>  Oh, and if you didn't use protection, there's a huge chance you're pregnant.|`|D5cOFZdwaa	Um its possible but in the mean time keep your legs closed if thats not possible make him wrap it b4 he whacks it|`|UZKfRM8naa	You have no way of knowing yet. But sure, you could be.

Quando ero incinta della mia 3 figlia ho convissuto con mia suocera per un paio di mesi, e non ti dico: un inferno!!<br>  Comunque, non fa assolutamente male che fai questi lavori mentre sei al 6° mese. Se fossero i primi tre ti direi di stare un'attimino attenta, ma adesso fai finché te la senti di fare. La cosa principale è ascoltare il tuo corpo. Se senti che si lamenta, lascia perdere e mettiti a letto con un buon libro, per ricaricarsi!<br>  In gravidanza ho sempre fatto di tutto (inclusi viaggi, campeggi, palestra, lavorato fino alla fine, e tutto ok! - a parte con l' ultima, che era ad alto rischio e non potevo fare sforzi di nessun genere...)<br>  Tranquilla e tanti tanti auguri!!|`|79c120aab65106c91b1e607e292292cfaa	Se stai bene, non hai complicanze e ti senti di farlo, lo puoi fare serenamente.

Inoltre a questo proposito non si dovrebbero fare tanti sport per questi timori e che invece in gravidanza sono consigliati.<br>  L'unico accorgimento e' non utilizzare prodotti che possono nuocere in gravidanza (ex. ammoniaca, candeggina,etc).|`|Yx73zECpaa	Più che altro stare tanto chinata non fa certo bene alla schiena già provata dalla gravidanza<br>  <br>  Fatti comprare il vaoperetto, riesci a pulire le macchie senza chinarti.<br>  <br>  E mi raccomando usa solo vernici atossiche anche da liquide.|`|pkXCQs0Kaa	basta che stai attenta a non sforzarti troppo, cerca una posizione un pò comoda, magari invece che a ginicchioni mettiti a sedere in terra e mano mano ti sposti|`|v5ZUyCukaa	Ah ah bella quella della suocera... chi è che vuole la suocera a acasa nessuno!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  Cmq sarebbe meglio che stai a riposo... falli fare a qualcun' altro!!!!

289482f6167f79da266361671c6ee50faa	io di consigli stregoneschi da dartene non ne ho pero' c'e' una teoria "semi seria" per la quale gli spermatozoi portatori del gene maschile sono piu' veloci ma meno longevi di quelli portatori del gene femminile che son piu' lenti ma vivono piu' a lungo.per cui se hai un rapporto nel giorno dell'ovulazione (ma ovviamente lo devi sapere tu esattamente quando ovuli, lo sai dalla durata del tuo ciclo, dalle perdite, dalla temperatura etc...) puo' probabilmente nascere un maschietto.<br>  io sono nata cosi', mia mamma ha sentito quetsa cosa alla radio e siccome voleva tanto una femminuccia ha provato e le è andata bene!io ho concepito il mio bimbo (maschio) estattamente il giorno in cui stavo ovulando(15 giorno)adesso vorrei tanto la femminuccia..speriamo bene<br>  baci e auguroni!|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	il sesso del bambino...viene definito da quando lo fai...mi senbra negli ultimi gg di fertilità (non vorrei dire una cazzata)....|`|TvdDWJJ0aa	Fortuna, anche se poi viene una femmina penso sei contenta lo stesso|`|e5bdd1610323027e44f0a57333be0d57aa	io ho sempre pensato che fosse maschio e alla fine era....maschio. ma non centra nulla è solo fortuna|`|oat4L5PSaa	le saeguenti istruzioni sono da seguire alla lettera durante il rapporto:<br>  <br>  -l'uomo deve infilare una mano in un frullatore e contemporaneamente cantare lo yodel.<br>  -la donna deve mettersi a testa in giùcon le gambe icrociate.<br>  dopodiche entrambi iniziano a saltellare in queste posizioni verso il telefono..<br>  alla fine si prende la cornetta e si chiama l'ambulanza perche nn credo che dopo aver fatto tutto questo starere benissimo...<br>  <br>  dopo aver fatto tutto questo...<br>  il bambino forse nn nasce maschio però vi sarete divertiti una cifra...|`|6ez5QxbVaa	molta della gente dice che dipende dal lato su qui si dorme per le prime settimane o i primi mesi (nn ricordo bene), cmq nn mi sembra una domanda assurda, ah e per il maskio devi dormire sul lato sinistro.|`|79c120aab65106c91b1e607e292292cfaa	Premettendo che e' il destino che decide per queste cose,.... ho comunque letto su vari siti internet che si ha piu' probabilita' di avere un bimbo maschio se quando lo si e' concepito si ha avuto rapporti frequenti e ravvicinati, e soprattutto il piu' vicino possibile al periodo piu' fertile (che e' il 14° giorno dopo il primo giorno dell'ultimo ciclo avuto).|`|GWpkvaTPaa	Puoi provare a mangiare carne rossa, salumi, verdura e cioccolato, comunque cibi molto saporiti e speziati.

Degrada la persona, distrugge la famiglia, corrompe la comunità. Nessuno di noi è libero dai suoi effetti e molti di noi hanno visto qualcuno usarla. Uno dei nostri cari, forse.La dipendenza dalla droga coinvolge sempre più individui di età sempre minore. Nessuno vuole essere un tossicodipendente, ma questo non impedisce a molti di cadere in questa trappola. Molteplici possono essere i motivi per cui una persona sceglie di prendere droga. Ma è sempre una incapacità di affrontare un qualche tipo di situazione. Si prende droga nel tentativo di "risolvere" un qualche problema,dopodichè l'organismo sviluppa tolleranza verso la sostanza e la persona è costretta, per riprovare l'effetto ricercato, a prenderne di più e più spesso. A questo punto si è in trappola.<br>  io consiglio vivamente a tutti coloro che ne fanno uso di smettere di usarla perchè non fanno altro che recare danno alla loro salute e cadere sempre più in uno stato di profondo deperimento, sprofondando così in un lungo tunnel che, se non verrano presi gli adeguati ripari, apparirà sempre più senza via d'uscita...<br>  <br>                                                            *§*Fr4nCy*§*|`|6iunSwCLaa	si quando ero più piccolo verso i 16 anni, fumavo qualche canna... ma non ne sono mai andato proprio pazzo, mi piace più bere... anche se ora bevo pochissimo!!!<br>  di altro nada!!!|`|80rbtv3maa	una volta mi hanno invilato una canna in bocca sn stata male x 48 ore|`|D1j4RM3saa	io nn ho mai provato e credo ke nn lo faro mai .<br>  nei momenti in qui sono moooolto giu mi viene la voglia x sentirmi meglio almeno poki minuti .<br>  e nn ti nascondo nemmeno k qualke volta vorrei provare sai la kuriosita . una volta ero talmente giu e stavo uscendo da scuola e si sa k ce sempre qlk amico k se le fa . questo mi ha kiesto di provare ero vicina a farlo ma nn so quale forsa mi ha spinto a nn provare nn lo  stavo quasi x  fare un tiro ma poi ho detto di no ma e strano <br>  nn voglio farlo anche se solo x curiosita mi piacerebbe <br>  ciao ciao|`|Ev8x8wNAaa	Dipende che droga!!

z6BtwSE8aa	Your luteal phase starts the day after you ovulated. There is no way to know just by the date of your period, since not every woman ovulates on day 14. If you got your period on the 20th then you probably haven't ovulated yet. Like I said, just start counting the day after you ovulate. The time between ovulation and your next period is your luteal phase.

Fh4B88ZGaa	The egg doesn't implant until about a week after ovulation, so you wouldn't feel ovulation cramps at the time of implanation.<br>  <br>  ETA: At ovulation, the egg is released into the fallopian tube. If it's fertilized, it moves down the fallopian tube and then implants into the uterus. This process can take anywhere from 5-7 days. Ovulation pain has nothing to do with it- when you ovulate, your ovary has no way of knowing what is going to become of that egg.|`|EAzyjftKaa	sORRY I'M NO HELP I NEVER FELT ANYTHING, well i take that back one day after sex i told my husband i think i'm pregnant.

I wish we all could be super hawks able to be on top of our children 24/7 to make sure they don’t touch things they shouldn’t.

fohSd9SEaa	e' meglio farlo , NON prima di 14 gg dal rapporto sospetto. infatti se vi fosse stato concepimento, l'uovo fecondato dovrebbe avere il tempo di passare dalla tuba e annidarsi (circa dai 7 ai 9 gg) , dopo che si e' annidato, incomincia la produzione di hcg, ormone della gravidanza che puo'essere rilevato dal test di grav sulle urine, solo in valori al di sopra dei 20 m/uil . (test precoci)<br>  quindi consiglio di attendere almeno 14 gg dal rapporto sospetto e comprare in farmacia o nei grandi supermercati, un test precoce oppure effettuare test delle urine in un laboratorio analisi.<br>  ciao|`|9YC3wypFaa	DOPO MINIMO 1 SETTIMANA DAL RAPPORTO MA ANKE 2 KE è MEGLIO!!|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	dopo + di 2 settimane....e costano circa sui 15 euro|`|ixrqPHyiaa	d solito dopo 5 o 6 giorni d ritardo del ciclo...<br>  dipende dal test ke compri...<br>  li trovi in farmacia o anke in alcuni suxmercati...<br>  di solito sono sui 10 euro...|`|2U4bkKypaa	una settimana,dieci giorni....in farmacia...quello singolo sui 12 euro....quello doppio credo 18....|`|FjQNYwybaa	direi dopo 1 settimana, lo puoi comprare in farmacia e costa circa 10€  in quanto alla marca sono tutti attenibili|`|GWxxsCT7aa	sono tutti attendibili al 95%,lo trovi in farmacia e se vuoi la certezza compra la confezione da due.caserà intorno ai 15,00 dopo 3-4 giorni dal rapporto già è veritiero il risultato.in bocca al lupo!!!|`|HiULyGtFaa	Dal 1° giorno di ritardo del ciclo mestruale.

Certo, si può fare anche prima ma il risultato non sarebbe sicuro, alcuni test di gravidanza dicono che se fatti 4 giorni prima dell'arrivo del ciclo l'attendibilità è del 50%... vale a dire che si fa prima a fare a testa o croce. Se vuoi un risultato sicuro e attendibile prima dell'arrivo del ciclo devi fare l'esame del sangue per la gravidanza sull'Hcg, un ormone prodotto dall'embrione in via di formazione. Questo test devi però eseguirlo almeno 7, meglio 10 giorni dopo il rapporto. eseguire test prima vuol dire non avere risultati certi perchè in caso di gravidanza ci vuole qualche giorno perchè l'Hcg sia rilevabile da qualsiasi test ed il risultato sia certo

jaP0TANdaa	Well, some women do bleed during early pregnancy. How heavy is your bleeding? If it is as heavy as your "normal" flow during your period and lasts a while and is accompanied by cramps, I'd say it most likely was a chemical pregnancy :( But, if it's much lighter than usual and doesn't last as long, I'd just wait and test again in a few days. There are some women that have had what seemed to be a completely normal period and were pregnant though... so it's still possible. That's why there are so many women out there that don't know they're pregnant until two months along or more, the bleeding can trick you! Good luck and lots of sticky baby dust your way. Hopefully you'll stop bleeding and get a much stronger/clearer BFP in a few days.|`|H9t63i4Kaa	I think its your cycle coming on....Im sorry....keep trying, good luck!!!!|`|CIZjK2rAaa	I have heard of women having a period while pregnant.  I would suggest going to the doctor and having your hcg levels monitored.  If the numbers are doubling then you are fine.

I hope your baby is okay.|`|xwZKouCIaa	You got 2 BFP and now your crampins and bleeding? hun i suggest you get urself to a doctor or emergency room cause you could posibly have a miscarriage, my friend had the same symptoms the other day and miscarried, sorry if i scare you i am truely concerned.. bleeding is normal in the beginning of pregnancy but could also be signs of a miscarriage if you go to the doctors they can tell you whats goin on.. or go to the e r|`|14RzmDTmaa	you need to go to the doc now!!! this happened to me in nov and i was having a mc i was only 3 weeks. i hope it's just a period during early prenacy, but go to the doc or hospital now, please. good luck keep us posted.

dI664zW0aa	Hi There,<br>  <br>  Your body will produce as much as baby drinks so if he nurses three times a day your body will reduce production to three times a day its supply and demand. At 12 months 3 times a day is just fine and your body knows what to do naturally no need to pump or take supplements. If your baby seems like he needs to nurse more often that 3 times a day it probably means he is needing more of his mommy rather than more of the milk :) <br>  <br>  If you are cutting back nursing I would also start him on other liquids like juice water and cows milk.<br>  <br>  Oh and Congratulations for making it to 1 year breastfeeding!!!!! You have a lucky little boy!|`|T0gv52CDaa	Your milk supply will decrease to meet the new need, but that is what you want it to do, or you will end up engorged and uncomfortable.|`|SeAvCGlYaa	If you slowly wean him down to 3 times a day, and maintain that schedule, then your body will make enough milk for the 3 times a day you want to nurse but if you go a couple of days where you skip one or two feedings, your milk may dry up a little. So just be careful and stick to the 3 times a day and you shouldn't have any problems.<br>  <br>  And congrats to you for breast feeding your older baby! Great job!|`|vue9NOhYaa	By 12 months your supply should be able to adjust. Many toddlers just nurse once or twice a day. (Like at nap and bedtime.)|`|TrUjyEJAaa	My daughter is only 7 months old, and I started part-time nursing around 6 months. I feed her in the morning, around 5 pm, and again at bedtime. About the half the time I will feed her during midnight wake-ups, otherwise her dad gets up with her. I started the transition slowly, only cutting out one feeding a day at at time. I have noticed that my breasts do not get as engorged as they used to, but I have had little to no discomfort and have still been able to breastfeed my baby whenever I choose. Good luck to you!|`|TJ04fAgNaa	If he is still feeding 3 times a day from you, then your body will make sure you have enough for that.  You won't have as much as you do now, but you'll have enough for those feedings.  It's supply and demand.  If you want to have more, you'll need to pump in between feedings.|`|DKfScL8taa	Yes it will probably reduce. I started feeding my son only in the morning and night, and after a week I just didn't have enough milk for him to eat, so he is now entirely on formula. My supply went down fast.|`|AA11131747	With my first son I tried this, and within a week my supply had dried up. However I have heard other mothers who have been successful at it.

Del resto e' vera la frase che dicevano nel film "Il Corvo" :  << NON PUO' PIOVERE PER SEMPRE! >> , e presto ci sara' un bellissimo arcobaleno ed un grande sole anche per noi.
6aYNPwBsaa	Sì, stai rischiando tantissimo. 2 mie amiche adesso sono mamme proprio grazie al coito interrotto. Sicuramente saprai che nel liquido che precede la fuoriuscita dello sperma, si possono già trovare degli spermatozoi. Se proprio non hai voglia di prendere la pillola e vi siete scocciati del preservativo (ti capisco!!), puoi provare ad usare il cerotto, che ha la stessa funzione della pillola, ma, ovviamente, meno controindicazioni oppure l'anello vaginale. Vai da un ginecologo o in un consultorio familiare e chiedi consiglio a loro.|`|7ecd307939fad42f86717854d005648baa	be..direi proprio di si, anche perchè come saprai, lo sperma fuoriesce a piccolissime dosi anche durante il rapporto..<br>  concordo con te sulla pillola,essendo ormoni, può farti ingrassare ma di certo non prenderai 50 kg! se proprio non ti ispira l'idea della pillola, c'è anche la spirale, che non è affidabile come la pillola, ma sempre meglio del salto della quaglia... poi chiedi consiglio alla tua ginecologa, saprà sicuramente consigliarti bene!|`|J0Ej5LcXaa	Rischi moltisssssimo. La pillola se presa nel modo giusto, non ti fa ingrassare. L'importante che ti fai segiure da un ginecologo che ti farà fare i vari esami.|`|VaT6OS03aa	se non vuoi usare nè la pillola nè il preservativo le opzioni sono due: o il cerotto, ke ha lo stesso principio della pillola, o "Persona" un aggeggino ke t analizza le urine e t dice se sei fertile o no, ma il coito interrotto nn è un metodo sicuro|`|Yx73zECpaa	il coito interrotto ha una percentuale di fallimento pari al 30%.<br>  <br>  Si rischi abbastanza.|`|auaS5TbSaa	Rischi parecchio,rischi di rimanerci! ci sono anche altri metodi contraccettivi,prova ad informarti!|`|tkBk3ok4aa	tantissimo<br>  perchè anche se lui viene fuori,quel liquido più chiaro che fuoriesce prima,può contenere spermatozoi e quindi fecondarti.<br>  usate il preservativo o la pillola per stare sereni.|`|xbgY7jZ5aa	Abbastanza, il coito interrotto non è affidabile per niente. Quindi se non vuoi gravidanze continua col profilattico..<br>  Se hai bisogno..|`|2vDrNlFraa	si non è mai sicuro... per la pillola devi fare analisi per essere sicura che sia quella per te, la deve decidere la tua dotteressa o dottore proprio per evitare dei problemi... prendila perchè non è davvero sicuro il coito interrotto...|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	rischi eccome....dovresti andare dal tuo ginecologo|`|N9PzeQBdaa	Sei disposta ad avere un bambino? Se si no problema poichè il rischio è grande. Se no allora adotta un altro metodo contraccettivo poichè il coito interrotto nn è un metodo contrccettivo. Io l'ho fatto con il coito interrotto per molti anni ma solo perchè nel mio caso un bambino sarebbe stato sempre il benvenuto quindi se fosse successo saremmo stati felici.|`|b1b0b42dd470c4f8709d3dd3a6f9229baa	Ciao!<br>  mi dispiace dirtelo ma si,stai rischiando molto...il coito interrotto non è un metodo contraccettivo!<br>  pensa bene alla pillola:potete farlo senza e in piu RILASSATI perche non rischiate nulla...!<br>  la pillola gonfia un po,1 o 2 kg massimo...ma ci sono anche opzioni alternative alla pillola come l'anello Nuvaring:funziona come la pillola,ma con la meta degli ormoni...quindi ti gonfi la meta,se hai episodi di diarrea o vomito puoi stare tranquilla e non devi ricordartelo ogni giorno!<br>  Ciao!|`|ecf633f8ac0f82e8aff2062a4b77404faa	io ho usato il coito interrotto 2 volte e in una di qste sn rimasta incinta..usa la pillola..tanto x dartela ti fanno gli esami del sangue quindi te ne danno una adatta a te..io nn sn ingrassata!!e appena metti su 2-3 kg puoi chiedere di cambiarla finchè ne trovi una adatta a te|`|v5ZUyCukaa	Il coito interrotto nn è un metodo anticoncezionale... ma un modo per avere bambini...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  Prova la pillola è molto più sicura e puoi vivere il tuo rapporto tranquillamente.. può anche venirti dentro senza problema....però solo dopo il primo mese....

63973d5a7ba818caf81975bf2d8a73e8aa	Ciao.................devo risponderti anke qui.<br>  Allora il mio consiglio e' sempre lo stesso :<br>  dacci dentro sempre e comunque senza avere l'ossessione di farlo nei giorni giusti ,  se proprio non ci dormi la notte e i test ovulatori costano una cifra e sono incomprensibili e il muco cervicale inesistente prova con la temperatura basale , certo non e' il massimo ficcarsi il termometro appena sveglia nella...........ma e' l'unico modo x capire l'andamento del ciclo guarda qui:<br>  www.cercounbimbo.net (clicca sulla sinistra su faq )<br>  E' un sito che  chiarisce molto le idee.<br>  Comunque anche se e'  improbabile si puo' avere l'ovulazione anche durante il ciclo mestruale ,x noi donne nulla e' scontato .<br>  Ci sentiamo presto un bacino|`|2vDrNlFraa	vorrei anche io un bambino, senti una risp certa non posso dartela, ma magari aspetta la prossima ovulazione e riprova...|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	¨nn ne so molto in materia....cmq auguroni....|`|907f47a343dfc8a4eb04e70f271ad2deaa	la natura fa delle cose strane delle volte <br>  cmq se non andrà questa volta la prossima sarà forse quelle migliore non preoccuparti o non stressarti <br>  arriverà quando non te l' aspetti|`|L5KOCepAaa	ti auguro che questa volta vada bene e che ben presto ci dirai "finalmente ce l'abbiamo fatta!".in bocca al lupo...si,cmq può anche succedere che avvenga un'ovulazione durante il ciclo mestruale, spero che sia proprio qst il tuo caso. baci. facci sapere|`|wkkJii2Gaa	Ciao, io purtroppo non so rispondere alla tua domanda ma ci tenevo a farti gli auguri per questo bimbo che state cercando... spero che arriverà al più presto!|`|LODxGoytaa	NO SEMPLICEMENTE XCHè QND HAI DELLE PERDITE,GLI SPERMATOZOI ANCHE SE ENTRANO...DOPO FUORIESCONO INSIEME ALLE PERDITE...OK ASPETTA CHE FINISCANO LE PERDITE E RIPROVA OK CIAO CIAO|`|TyfBMiIfaa	Non ne sono proprio sicura ma credo che, anche se molto improbabile, si può avere l'ovulazione anche durante le mestruazioni...quindi secondo me ci sono delle minime probabilità.

nVjWykmLaa	Ciao stellina<br>  a volte il ciclo ritarda per vari motivi:<br>  1. sei troppo agitata<br>  2. sei sotto stress<br>  3. sei nervosa<br>  4. sei incinta (ma solo nei casi eccezionali)<br>  Perciò io ti consiglio di:<br>  1. rilassati<br>  2. frenati un Po<br>  3. calmati<br>  4. auguri<br>  Quando dei agitata tardano ancora di più perché è come se tu psicologicamente le bloccassi, perciò il consiglio migliore è rilassarsi, e quello che sarà sarà..se no va a finire che invece del ritardo di 2 settimane sarà un ritardo di 2 mesi!....perciò sta tranquilla e prendi la vita come viene...ciao kisses<br>  <br>  PS:e poi può darsi pure che non sei regolare! Pensa a me sono mancate per 7mesi! ma grazie la pillola si sono regolarizzate, se vedi che tardano come sono tardate a me vai o da uno ginecologo o da un endocrinologo lui se terrà opportuno ti darà la pillola! Infine se stai seguendo una dieta..ATTENTA, di solito èl'eccessivo calo di peso che te le fa mancare!|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	magari non sei ancora pienamente regolare|`|8ba5ae72fd6c5d4d38450983cbf96801aa	bellissima domanda!<br>  <br>  Imotividi un ritardo sono vari...<br>  Escludendo la gravidanza che è ovvia diciamo che i casi piu comuni sono stress,dieta squilibrata,cisti ovariche o cmq cisti...<br>  <br>  Il ciclo è collegato all'umore perchè l'umore è ciò che altera gli ormoni....e come ben sappiamo gli ormoni sono molto importanti per le mestruazioni...|`|CUqxNV6haa	stress, cambiamenti climatici, ansia sono tutte situazioni che possono farle ritardare (escludo a priori gravidanza)...se vuoi cercare di regolarizzarle parla con la tua ginecologa...forse ti suggerisce una terapia con la pillola x alcuni mesi...|`|KB7IhgsYaa	sono tante le ragioni: ormoni, stress... in genere accade più spesso alle ragazze giovani...Se poi ti innervosisci e stai in ansia peggiora, quindi sta calma, è una cosa normalissima che si può anche (almeno nella maggior parte dei casi) risolvere con l'aiuto del ginecologo!

Yx73zECpaa	Concordo con tespesso si prendono le cose troppo alla leggera ma forse nonostante tutto l'informazione vera manca, mia mamma non era capace di parlare con me apertamente, mi ha fatta andare però presto da una ginecologa e  mi ha dato un libro che parlava di contraccezione ecc.<br>  <br>  Penso che in parte dipenda dai genitori che di questi argomenti con i figli hanno paura a parlarne (è più facile vietare a una ragazza di fare sesso che spingerla verso il sesso sicuro)<br>  <br>  I divieti servono proprio a essere infranti e tante volte uno dei motivi per cui non si usano i contraccettivi e anche la mancanza di fondi (anche perchè in Italia costano cifre assurde e in consultorio trovare preservativi in regalo è un utopia in Francia da questo lato le cose sono molto diverse)<br>  <br>  <br>  l'aborto è un esperienza tremenda ma penso che molti non se ne reandano pienamente conto, o ancora di più pensano che a loro non succederà mai.<br>  <br>  Non ritengo esista l'età giusta per il sesso in termini di numero di anni, l'età giusta è quella in cui ci si sa rendere conto dei rischi, di come evitarli al di la dell'anno di nascita.|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	sinceramente io ho 15 anni...e non l'ho ancora fatto...prima ho intenzione di informarmi e sopratutto di fidarmi di lui!!!!Perché diciamo che...lasciamo stare....e semmai dovessi rimanere in cinta...non ho per niente intenzione di abortire...perché ormai quell'individuo esiste e va rispettato!e farebbe parte di me...e come se mi uccidessi una parte....l'aborto lo odio...senza contare i rimorsi che mi verrebbero!!|`|X2Vd8wPPaa	Loro fanno sesso e anke i figli xke nn hanno valori morali nn per offendere nessuna sia kiaro ma non esiste ke una ragazza di 15 anni dopo 2 mesi di fidanzamento gia te la da..oggi contano i valori magari non farlo dopo il matrimonio ma aspettare la persona giusta quella ke sicuramente non ti farò soffrire e ke forse ki sa magari sarà anke tuo marito ma anke se nn lo sarà almeno l'hai fatto cn una xsona degna di te nn con il primo venuto..per quanto riguarda i figli povere creature li fanno xke nn se li crescono loro ma magari i loro genitori kosa sbagliatissima quindi sn prima i genitori ke nn insegnano i valori xke se tua figlia torna a casa cn il pancione nn sgridare e poi dp te lo tieni fagli kapire ke oggi nella vita bisogna fare i sacrifici per tenere un bambino fagli kapire ke oggi per sposarti ci vogliono i soldi..!!!|`|wtrkk78raa	le tue parole sono sagge..ciò significa che della vita ne sai qualcosa.. certe persone non capisco che non si può giocare con la vita degli altri..anche se esso giace e cresce dentro di te..!! l' aborto non è per nulla un metodo contraccettivo..certe cose si fanno con la testa sulle spalle..ciao..ps..ti ho acceso una stella..mi fa piacere vedere domande simili che concordano il mio punto di vista|`|NzgegB9zaa	Tatuccia adesso ragioniamo!<br>  <br>  Trovo il tuo ragionamento giustissimo ma mi permetto di aggiungerci un paio di considerazioni:<br>  - Io credo che in parte sia anche colpa dei genitori, io parlerò a mia figlia presto dei metodi anticoncezionali, le fornirò preservativi e le darò appoggio e protezione anche se non dovessi approvare alcuni comportamenti: noi mamme italiane in genere non permettiamo alle nostre ragazze di avere un rapporto gioioso con il sesso perchè le costringiamo a nasconderlo e a viverlo come un tabù, un divieto, una trasgressione. Anche io non sarei felice se mia figlia avesse rapporti sessuali a 14 anni ma di sicuro non farei finta di non vedere o glielo vieterei (anche perchè lo farebbe lo stesso ma di nascosto che è peggio), certo non ne sarei felice e proverei a parlarne.<br>  <br>  -L'aborto non è cosa semplice e veloce, si portano conseguenze a vita di una scelta del genere. Quando sarai donna e avrai un figlio voluto, ripenserai moltissimo al tuo angioletto che non c'è più. Inoltre è una vera e propria operazione che non si fa a cuore leggero. Detto ciò un bimbo non può essere una punizione, non si può dire "hai fatto sesso non protetto, bene allora ora ti tieni il bimbo"...dimmi il bimbo che colpa ne ha? e dovrà crescere con una mamma che lo odia e che non lo avrebbe voluto e che dovrà fronteggiare tremila difficoltà e che gliene darà sempre la colpa.Quello che queste ragazze dovrebbero sapere è che i bimbi si possono anche dare in adozione. In italia scarseggiano i bimbi dati in adozione e in fondo tra un aborto e una gravidanza meglio nascondere ad amici e parenti la seconda, portarla avanti e poi partorire anonimamente (si può in ospedale!) e dare il bimbo in adozione. Quello che bisogna dire a queste ragazze è che se si aspettano che dopo un aborto la loro vita proceda uguale a prima si sbagliano di grosso!!!!! un aborto non dura un giorno e il giorno dopo non si torna a scuola felici e contente: ragazze ragionateci su!|`|UK4kf2R2aa	penso che tutti sappiano che esiste il preservativo, solo che alcuni nn ci fanno caso, ovviamente nn vanno a cercar di restare incinta x poi aboertire xkè fidati nn è una bella esperienza, solo che a volte anke seguendo tutte le precauzioni può succedere...e allora lì che fai a 16 anni incinta?<br>  è una cosa bruttissima ma tenere un bambino così giovane vuol dire far vivere male te e il bambino che nascerà....xkè l'amore nn da da mangiare e nn compra i vestiti...<br>  <br>  <br>  nn ci fanno caso se si rompe intendo...mi sn spiegata male...e cmq se succede cosa bisogna fare spararci in testa...? si si può dire potevi pensarci prima...ma tanto è successo, le parole nn sefvono a nulla|`|VdgWg77baa	hai pienamente ragione,pure io ho visto domande da far rabbrividire secondo me prendono le cose troppo alla leggera.......ma l'aborto non si può usare come metodo contraccettivo......è meglio pensarci prima  ti accendo anche una stella|`|i4A8E4shaa	brava.un cervello su una testa .spero che le mie figlie ti assomiglino.comunque molti genitori fanno gli struzzi e non portano soprattuto le femmine in eta adolescenziale da un ginecologo per una bella chiacchierata.io le portero e tuttalpiu aspettero fuori.meglio insegnare a godersi la vita in tutta sicurezza che avere responsabilita troppo grandi per la loro eta.brava e continua cosi|`|wc8Sbnb8aa	CONCORDO PIENAMENTE...nemmeno io bacchettona nè moralista, però vorrei tanto che un giorno le mie figlie fossero un po' più giudiziose di tali ragazzine...e un po' meno affrettate nel fare cose più grandi di loro, spesso solo per dimostrare a se stesse e agli altri una maturità che ivece non c'è!!!|`|viKFlck5aa	Hai perfettamente ragione... abbastanza grandi per fare sesso ma assolutamente immature per pensare al dopo. <br>  <br>  Per rispondere a Vale: nella malaugurata ipotesi che il preservativo si rompa esiste la pillola del giorno dopo (te la danno al pronto soccorso) che nonostante sarebbe meglio evitarla (e tenere presente che cmq non è un rifugio sicuro dopo un incontro intimo senza precauzioni) è sempre meglio di un aborto e se presa tempestivamente impedisce addirittura la fecondazione.|`|OmTPFm6Maa	è 1cosa ke sconvolge anke me.. nn so nemmeno io se devo considerarmi una quasi 26enne bacchettona...ma già io ho delle perplessità a pensare ke ragazzine d 13, 14, 15 anni facciano regolarmente sesso con il proprio ragazzo..e  la perplessità nasce proprio dal fatto ke con le conseguenze del sesso nn si scherza!sia per la trasmissione d malattie gravissime sia per il rischio d gravidanze. A mio avviso la maturità nn serve solo xper vivere il sesso in maniera serena, ma xavere anke piena coscienza delle conseguenze a cui si va incontro e capire ke le precauzioni da prendere sono fondamentali!<br>  Sono favorevole all'aborto...ma sono d'accordo con te ke ormai siamo ai livelli d considerarlo 1metodo contraccettivo.<br>  Ed è 1cosa sconvolgente....
TrUjyEJAaa	It depends on who is throwing the shower for you. Would they be offended if you offered your advice? I suggest you do a little research, if you already haven't, and find a few you really like. If they bring up a suggestion for a cake you know you won't like, try saying, "Thats a really nice cake (or whatever response you feel like saying). I saw another one I really liked. Can I show you?" Hopefully whoever is throwing you your baby shower will be receptive to this and get the hint. It really shouldn't be that big of a deal to whoever is throwing the shower.|`|FKR45WLPaa	I think you should absolutely tell them what kind of cake you want.  Just tell whomever is organizing it, have them make the arrangements.  The party is for you, you should have whatever kind of cake that you want.  Last time that I threw a shower, I was relieved that the "star" gave me her input.  It took the pressure off of guessing what she really wants.|`|0floKHTIaa	umm. well yeah sorta. i take it as its not a suprise because you know about it! it all depends who is throwing the shower for you though.. you know if you should or not talk to them. also i do not think it would be rude! after all it is for YOU!!<br>  <br>  and congrats!|`|mvqfIjEVaa	My friend who threw my shower asked what my preference was - and I did the same when I threw a shower for my other friend.

My mom and best friend hosted mine but I was involved in the planning.|`|utfoP7GWaa	If it were me, I would just suggest the cake that you want (say something like: I'm not sure if you've ordered the cake, but I Love _____ cake!).

These people are throwing you a shower out of the goodness of their hearts!|`|Wjdpm4xNaa	WELL I WILL TYPE IN CAPS IF YOU CAN SEE IT BETTER.  I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE A SAY IN THE TYPE OF CAKE.

dI664zW0aa	I know this sounds very harsh but I would just flick his lip when he bites you after a couple of days it will stop and the emotional stress of cutting off breastfeeding at that age is much more detrimental than a little flick of the lip, The fact that he cries and tugs at your top means he is not emotionally ready to stop and the rejection could cause long term issues. I would ask a lactation consultant as well or do some research on the la leche league website.|`|N3uuSIBBaa	That sounds painful!  I am actually just weaning my 11 month old daughter and have experienced some of the same hardships.  I would get him a good sippy cup.  The kind that aren't totally hard, but have more of a soft bottle-like top.  My little girl loves hers.  I got it at Wal-mart.  Also, give him lots to eat other than just milk.  Don't let him get too hungry or tired...he will just want to nurse.  Be strong.  He will learn quickly.  It is tough.  Hope that helps!|`|T0gv52CDaa	Drop one feeding a week until all are done.  Make whichever is the hardest for him to give up the last one to stop.  You may want to teach him not to bite if you don't want to wean yet.  When my first son started doing that, I would just take him off of the breast for 5 minutes everytime he bit me.  After a few times of being pulled off as soon as he bit down, he stopped biting.  I went on to nurse him for 13 months until I wanted to get pregnant again.|`|naEk1QkSaa	Idk... teach him to use a sippycup!|`|acj9mB9Paa	You need to find a lactation consultant!!!  Your baby just needs help with his latch and all will be fine!|`|DKfScL8taa	The nuk sippy cup <br>  <a href="http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.asp?pid=165750&catid=26965&aid=337953&aparam=gerber_nuk_learner_cup_&CAWELAID=61281225" rel="nofollow">http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.a...</a><br>  the only bottle or cup my breastfed ever took.

Fh4B88ZGaa	The only way to resolve this is to communicate and come to a compromise. You don't mention why he wants to wait. Your concerns about your fertility are valid- the closer you get to 40, the harder it become to conceive and the risks for problems with the pregnancy increase. Talk to him about why he wants to wait, and see if there are any ways that he might feel comfortable with a shorter wait. Make sure he understands all of the risks of waiting- google "advanced maternal age" and you'll get a lot of data.<br>  <br>  You need to find a way to meet each other's needs. This is a conversation you probably should have worked out before you said "I do", but since you didn't, you have to have it now. Get a timeline that you both can agree upon- because you are setting youself up for an erosion of your marriage since you are supressing your needs for him.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|3AywreElaa	All I have to say is you are not "creating a life that is half wanted"<br>  <br>  Your love as a mother can cover the father<br>  and down the road someone will love that child and marry them<br>  and they will have children who will love them and friends who will love them|`|AA10322137	I think sarah's answer is the best one,I can't add any thing else.good luck.but remember this that you are bringing a kid in to this world to satisfy your own needs,and wants.have you ever thought about how you will bring up your kid? how much money you need to have until he/she is able to earn a living?if the answer is yes go ahead,have fun.
zHmZkMStaa	Sorry to scare you, but my sis was 34 when she first tried to conceive.<br>  At 37, a fertility specialist told her her eggs were prematurely too 'old' to ever be fertilized.  She remains childless :(<br>       You need to barage your husband with facts, info, pamphlets and educational materials to prove to him that age 40 is too late to start.<br>  Good luck, Hon.  Kick him to the curb if he resists - he's useless, and clearly not good father material, anyway.|`|faPKwClPaa	If he's aware of what you what, I have to assume that means you were aware of his schedule and agenda as well.  Therefore, where's the surprise of what's transpired?<br>  <br>  I'm not being rude, but it appears you did know this before you got married, so it seems odd to try and fix it now.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't feel ready to have a baby until a couple of years, well, I'd respect that.  Having a baby is a HUGE deal and a ton of work -- if you both aren't on the same page, it can destroy a marriage (much like you're worried about).<br>  <br>  See what comes of the doctor's appointment.  If you are in fact pregnant, you both need to sit down and discuss what you want to do.  And seriously consider the fact you may end up raising a child on your own.<br>  <br>  I wish you luck.|`|ZEYEmYRtaa	If I was u I would have liked to have started having children now as like u said if u would like to have further children and u wait until u r 40 u will be almost 44 45 when u have your Second child. I would sit down and make him see what u want. <br>  I am sure all this stress is not doing you no good what so ever, so have a long chat and make a plan, even if u wait another year then u r preg for almost a year...<br>  Hope this has helped a little.<br>  xx|`|2n0B4cY6aa	Well to be honest i would start having kids now, after 35 years old the eggs deteriorate quite rapidly and your more likely to have problems concieving and downs syndrome etc is more likely.

A me è capitato, l'ho presa ed è andato tutto bene, anzi il ciclo mi è venuto regolarissimo... Comunque anche se ti capita di sera, all'ospedale puoi andare sempre,e vai nella prima guardia medica aperta(nelle città ci deve essere per forza una farmacia aperta, anche di notte)...Ecco tutto!|`|btNIjuScaa	inizia a pregare.....tanto!!|`|lXOWX9c5aa	vai dal tuo medico e parla cn lui . è la migliore strategia|`|sNcU7Lzqaa	certo che se si rompe il preservativo (e lui viene dentro ovviamente) il rischio c'è...le cose da fare sono 2 o nulla e rischiare ( almeno che tu non voglia un pupo) o andare dal tuo medico e farti dare la pillola del giorno dopo che non è prorpio il massimo per il tuo corpo perchè è una bella botta di ormoni ma a mali estremi estremi rimedi...cioè, mo non è una cosa tragica, anzi, però magari evita di farlo capitare 2 volte vicine...capito?...spero la tua sia solo curiosità e non ti trovi nella situazione da te presentata...

Sing a song or make up one, or sing patty cake or something like that. <br>  <br>  Do you have to stay sitting in a circle? Because you could get up and play follow the leader wile walking in a circle. You could also stand up and dance for a little bit and you can dance wile holding the special needs kid. <br>  <br>  You could also tell the kids to bring a stuffed animal to preschool the next day or the next time you'll be together.

Se la risposta sarà positiva allora spiega a tuo marito che tu i figli li vuoi ma vorresti aspettare un anno-due...giusto per sentirti un po' più sicura e matura. Se la risposta degli esami fosse negativa...allora, se davvero vuoi un bimbo, ti consiglio di iniziare ciò che serve perchè l'iter è piuttosto lungo e gli anni passeranno molto veloci, purtroppo. <br>  Ti capisco per il cambiamento...la mia prima bambina è arrivata velocemente, non pensavo di rimanere subito incinta (stavamo tentando...ma sinceramente pensavo mi ci volesse qualche mese...) e così all'inizio è stato un po' un "trauma".

3QcYecLlaa	Io sono convinta che nn esistano le coincidenze e ne ho una prova certa per quanto riguarda la mia storia. è molto probabile che quella nn sia stata una semplice coincidenza ma che sia stato il destino a metterci del suo! Te lo auguro con tutto il cuore! Aspetta ancora un pò e vedrai..se ti guarda ancora con gli stessi occhi altre volte hai buone speranze! Mia nonna diceva sempre: "Se è il tuo uomo nessuno e niente te lo porterà via e se è destino che tu ti rimetta con lui un giorno vi rincontrerete". Queste parole me le aveva dette quando il mio ex mi aveva lasciata. Ora ho un altro ragazzo ma queste parole valgono sempre...se è destino lo incontrerai di nuovo e a quel punto nn sarà proprio una coincidenza! =)|`|4f0ece6bf45c02ac974a7def46d7c9dbaa	La speranza c'è CREDICI.

GQ1zLsQ8aa	Period like cramping is normal, as long as it's not severe. It happened to me too. However, if it gets severe or you start bleeding, call your doctor or go to the ER immediately.|`|Qe9FmH8raa	It's normal. It means your uterus and ligaments are stretching and growing. As long as they don't get more severe (as in, you are doubled over, can't walk or talk) and you don't bleed, you're fine. I had them when I was pregnant with my daughter and I have them with this pregnancy too. Don't worry too much about it.

nSp1GmaWaa	MIra si tu médico te ha dicho que todo va bien es porque es así, no siempre crecen mucho, a veces crecen o engordan más una semana que otra no te preocupes!!! Además es normal que tengas toda clase de miedos y dudas y que te preocupes por todo, más si es tu primer bebé pues a todas nos ha pasado si vieras las preguntas que la hacía yo a mi médico y las cosas que me ponía a pensar!!!! Pero ellos saben, no es el tuyo el primer bebé que trae al mundo y no se va a arriesgar!!! Es normal que te procupes y tengas miedos a todas nos ha pasado, pero no te vuelvas looooca pues el estres es malo para el bebé y tu médico sabe, confía en él!!<br>  Besos y Mucha Suerte!!!<br>  Athina.<br>  P.D: Si te sientes mal o asustada y quieres hablar con alguien mándame un correo que yo te contesto.|`|34f6b12713ee30093e6fd193fe865332aa	Te doy un consejo, no te preocupes, evidentemente tu doctor no vio necesario alarmarte con que algo malo le pasaba a tu bebita, suele ocurrir (a mi me pasó), en algún mes del embarazo el bebé no crece, a veces por crecer más en el mes anterior, entonces al mes siguiente equipara esos centímetros de más.<br>  Existen problemas de crecimiento de bebés, casi siempre por enfermedades tipo diabetes gestacional, stress, o cuando la placenta no cumple con la función de nutrir bien al bebé. En estos casos el obstetra suele realizar una ecografía para descartar retardo en el crecimiento. En el caso que se compruebe que hay retardo, los médicos optan por sacarlo antes, aunque permanezcan en incubadora, van a estar mejor que en el vientre.<br>  Quedate tranquila y pregunta sin miedo a tu obstetra, sacate todas las dudas y si finalmente no te convence proba cambiar de obstetra, necesitas confiar en él, así transitas tu embarazo contenta, sin angustias.<br>  Espero haberte ayudado y mucha suerte con tu beba!!|`|FVDbztUdaa	durante mi embarazo yo tome desde el comienzo  el ácido folico y aparte me dieron las materna mi ginecólogo en mi primer embarazo me paso lo mismo pero después comenzó a crecer en el siguiente mes y bastante aparte no me cuide al comer lo que se me antojara, también se refleja en la dieta que lleves ya que eso afecta también acuardate que compartimos los nutrientes con nuestro bebe las infecciones me dijo mi ginecólogo solo lo pueden llegar afectar a la hora del nacimiento que entra en contacto con ello y por ultimo depende de tu persona si eres alta, peque?a gordita o tiendes a ser delgada o también tu marido pero no te preocupes si llevas buen control medico.|`|J0qLUrpVaa	No te preocupes.

Antes o después de tu infección?  En cualquier caso, si no te sientes segura con la opinión de tu ginecólogo, busca una segunda opinión para que te calmes.

Masturbarsi è un atto normalissimo e naturale che può però sfociare nelle parafilie in caso di esagerazioni. ma ovviamnete non p il tuo caso. La mastrubazione non è patologica e non lo è nemmeno il non praticarla. Bene, detto questo, l'atto in sè è molto soggettivo. Ci sono donne che si masturbano direttamente o indirettamente, con fantasie più o meno "esplicite". Sta a te torvare la modalità che ti aiuti maggiormente a raggiungere il piacere. Le fantasie possono aiutare, ovviamente.<br>  Gli psicologi, infine, hanno affermato che la masturbazione è un atto salubre pouichè favorisce la conoscenza fisica e psichica di se stessi in un periodo di grandi cambiamebnti, come l'adolescenza ma, in particolari condizioni, sempre.

E' con questi adolescenti  che si può continuare a credere nei giovani,  è con loro che abbiamo la certezza che non sono tutte/i come voi e me ne  accorgo  anche da qui  quante domande interessanti possano uscire da un cervello di adolescente...anche sul sesso e su la masturbazione  perchè no...ma domande costruttive...non schifezze..gratuite.. ma ovviamente parlo di ragazze/i "sani"  che non pensano solo a come fare sesso orale o il metodo migliore per masturbarsi...  <br>  Ahhh un ultima cosa...complimenti per la proprietà di linguaggio di alcune/i... quando non si sa cosa dire si inizia con il turpiloquio...come volevasi dimostrare....o sesso o parolacce...è solo questo il  modo di esprimere le vostre ragioni siatene fieri...<br>  In aggiunta a tutto...questo è un sito pubblico ed io ho la possibilità di leggere e rispondere quanto, quando e come voglio....purchè non vada oltre il limite...e mi sembra che qui il limite non l'ho passato io...|`|dhI5yQMUaa	sicuramente avere una fantasia che ti eccita mentre lo fai aiuta tantissimo,poi puoi provare con vari tipi di vibratori,e quando stai per venire butta fuori l'aria dalla pancia,mi spiego,apri la vag.ina come se dovessi fare pipì e cerca il tuo punto massimo...comunque l'unica per conoscere il proprio corpo é provare di continuo|`|ixrqPHyiaa	x ogni ragzza è diverso...<br>  anke xkè è una situazione mentale...<br>  c'è k prova + piacere utilizzzando il getto della doccia, ki usando mezzi artificiali (apposta e non), ki solo accarezzandosi...<br>  ma è tutta una questione psikologica...<br>  molte (come me x esempio) non provano neppure tanto piacere, altre nn provano neppure...

2ef14de7fec995e63b420b03840504e0aa	La cosa è alquanto soggettiva, alcune persone sono sensibili ai baci sul collo (provochi loro degli intensi brividi lungo la schiena).

W8rDz88eaa	non ti preoccupare, non sei incinta, rimanere incinta durante il ciclo mestruale è quasi impossibile se lo hai fatto dal 1° al quarto giorno. Possibile solo se l'hai fatto dopo il 4° giorno, quando non sono più vere e proprie mestruazioni, ma perdite residue di sangue. Dopo nove giorni dal ciclo ci può essere una prima ovulazione (sai che non ce n'è una al mese),oppure uno sbalzo ormonale che ti da sintomi come gonfiore del seno o ingrossamento dell'aureola del capezzolo o dolori al basso ventre.

neqTPSf5aa	dipende....sicuramente il computer e la tv sono esagerati xò succede veramente...devi farti fare quello ke ti senti...se 6 veramente innamorata o vuoi provare nuove esperienze xkè no? dipende...devi decidere tu...varia da persona a persona! baci e... fai sempre quello ke ti senti!|`|EFvKDhdpaa	nn è d certo una fantasia... a me succede spesso|`|fPGLIofHaa	Si mi capita spesso, e ti posso assicurare che ogni volta che lui si avvicina è una sensazione meravigliosa. La cosa importante è però sentirsi pronta per accettare queste carezze (perché cosi devono essere), e se lui ti obbliga vuol dire che non ti porta rispetto. Deve essere un gesto naturale, e non un obbligo. Buona esperienza.|`|2vDrNlFraa	non vedo cosa ci sia di male... anche io spesso con il mio ragazzo come è normale che noi lo facciamo ai maschietti|`|TEq0ruXmaa	ragazze ma siete impazzite??ma chi vi può rispondere a domande simili??anche chi se lo fa fare non direbbe mai la verità!!abbiate un pò di pudore..|`|2c506b4a229d89af3c4f968eb5424989aa	si chiama sesso orale e esiste!|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	io non l'ho mai fatto......|`|f6efaaab39a9c5db54291aa67c36c46aaa	a me il mio ragazzo l'ha leccata!!!e' una cosa normale....provala e' un consiglio!!!!|`|w9tCkXRIaa	Ma che salotto è diventato answer !

Cmq si, io me la faccio leccare dal mio ragazzo ed é bellissimo e piacevolissimo!|`|LkHc38cJaa	no , lo fanno in tanti...|`|OAZcccBfaa	Ma quale fantasia è realtà il mio lui me la lecca sempre|`|UK4kf2R2aa	certo ke capita, nell'intimità cn il proprio ragazzo ne capitano di cose....|`|YyTyBFpoaa	Ti rispondo anche se non sono una ragazza. <br>  Guarda che è una cosa naturale, tutto ciò che da piacere ed è condiviso dalla coppia senza falsi pudori, è un bene per l'armonia del viviere insieme. Se invece è un forzatura di uno dei due, è meglio lassciar perdere.|`|a4e89c257337acef655bf3bfadfc3870aa	Eh eh...non si chiede!|`|aec01d36d45d4e12297d32bca207ff24aa	ma quale  fantasia...|`|e3b28711904ded45bebf13e8d19d1186aa	Dalla tua domanda mi sembra di capire che 6 piccola come età.

mfo3PnxZaa	with my last pregnancy, I was told I could take a children's chewable vitamin 2 times a day.  Since I have difficulty swallowing pills, it really helped me out.|`|4JkpaEh9aa	Generic name Natal Care Pic Forte...Don't know the brand name equivalent. Prescription needed.  Large to swallow but not smelly and easy on the stomache.|`|c6DG4FWjaa	Im taking Blackmores Pregnancy and breastfeeding tablets. They dont smell and they dont make me sick.|`|d79a5c96406488776f3985b36d457ab4aa	Yeah, I take One Source Prenatal. This is less costly than prescription and my doctor said that the most important part is the Folic Acid, which One Source has plenty of.<br>  <br>  I just swallow them with some water and never smell or taste a thing. In addition to this I also take Expecta...which is a DHA supplement. This too, does not have a taste or smell whatsoever...my doctor highly recommended this....because it's suppose to really help with brain and eye development.<br>  <br>  These are both available at any Target or Wal-mart by the prenatal vitamins.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!|`|f702c74a79e9a07d76b8483b4aec08f2aa	I take Citracal Prenatal Vitamin + DHA. It gives a daily dose of both, and they have been working fine for me so far, and these are gotten with a prescription|`|njAuRLkuaa	Look for one with lower iron if you're getting sick, if it's just that they smell/taste bad there is one for sale at Walmart that I used, I'm sorry I don't remember the name but there's a rabbit on the front and they're over the counter if that helps. If you can get over the smell but not the taste try taking it with a few sips of milk. Sip the milk first because dairy coats the mouth and throat, then gulp it down. Good luck. P.S. Does it mention anything about omega oils? Usually that's the thing that smells bad, look for one with less.|`|s6DMkT5Faa	I used solgar brand. You have to take 4 pills a day, but they are very gentle on the tummy and are coated so they don't taste like anything. i do not recommend rainbow light brand, they taste horrible.|`|5d72d00e596ce5a506a4ea3db9ae0be4aa	PrimaCare one tastes sort of like vanilla. Ask your doc for them!  The first script they gave me tasted like fish not only going down but for hours afterwards and they made me sick. Gross!|`|bc7e0ec8c3bc5dbc9ec1cdd56e6ebe81aa	If you don't find a multi vitamin that you can take, try just taking folic acid on it's own.  It's much smaller, virtually odorless and tasteless and much gentler on the stomach.

Il rischio c'è, ma se stai attenta, essendoti comunque venute oggi e quindi il ciclo non è troppo, potresti non rinunciare alla tua serata. Se non ti senti a tuo agio, dì ai tuoi amici di rimandare perchè hai u problema immaginario se ti imbarazzi o, in caso contrario, quello reale.

kHvC0Ilsaa	credo che gli adulti dicano così perchè secondo loro uno cambia, fa nuove amicizie e si innamora facilmente, il fatto è che secondo me loro ci assillano dicendo queste cose così da migliorarci o per spaventarci del futuro o di quello che verrà. ma non si rendono conto che ci privano della nostra adolescenza dicendo: non fare questo, non puoi andare a casa del tuo amico/a, attento a non fumare (quando loro fumano) e tutte cose del genere. e poi se litighiamo con qualcuni ci dicono di giudicarci da soli per prima cosa quando loro pensano solo a noi. insomma, credo che anche un po' di libertà abbiamo il diritto di avela, no???|`|EVVaEZXRaa	Io tornerei indietro subito.<br>  Ma forse a 70 anni mi andrebbe bene anche di tornare all'età che ho ora..|`|IpiWGsetaa	io penso ke l'adolescenza sia il momento + brutto della nostra vita xkè ti cambia da morire|`|Vi96uFi4aa	anke io sono adolescente...<br>  ho 14 anni...<br>  dimmi...rifletti un attimo, io ci ho pensato: la vita di un adolescente è fatta di cambiamenti fisici, psicologici...si comincia a conoscere l'altro sesso, si fanno le prime esperienze e si hanno le prime delusioni, ci si prepara per la vita adulta...<br>  la vita adulta: lavoro lavoro, responsabilità su responsabilità, una famiglia da mantenere, bisogna essere attenti con i figli, ma nn troppo altrimenti sei assillante, con la moglie/marito devi soddisfarlo ma nemmeno essere troppo fissati...<br>  pensa a tutte queste cose...ma quale PARADISO???<br>  ciao 1 kiss grande|`|bYtAZhy1aa	ciao..sono d'accordissima con te..fortunatamente ho passato quaesta fase ...è piena di cambiamenti,di cose vietate,sei sempre troppo piccola per fare le cose dei grandi e troppo grande per fare le cose dei piccoli...insomma ora sto benissimo..libera e indipendente|`|mpmo0UPraa	hai pienamente ragione anche io lo dico tutti i grandi dicono "godetevela la vostra adolescenza" ma che c-a-z-z-o dite... l'adolescenza è pina di delusioni, nn ti permettono di fare nnt... e sembra che nex ti capisce quandi concordo con te a tutti quegli adulti che dicono che l'adolescenza è bella deve solo fare il c-e-s-s-o... ciao e bella domanda continua così ti metto anche la stellina (finalmente una domanda sensata)...!!! ciao|`|s0L3rOEEaa	io sono adolescente,ma ho 28 anni...oggi si e' adolescenti fino 50 anni,spesso...nn credere,sai?|`|vbnGOMU6aa	Io non la ricordo affatto rose e fiori e se mi chiedessero di tornare indietro non accetterei mai, ma la mia situazione faceva davvero schifo...forse se avessi vissuto un 'adolescenza normale adesso mi mancherebbe.

Ciao!!!|`|og8rQPwJaa	Anche secondo me, l'adolescenza non è stata per niente l'età migliore della vita...<br>  viene detto questo ai ragazzi, perchè i genitori si ricordano che nella loro c'era  povertà ma si era più uniti, i rapporti umani erano meno complicati, e poi si era mooooolto più ingenui (tutti gli argomenti sessuali venivano "bannati", specie alle ragazze).<br>  E poi, la lontananza nel tempo e nello spazio migliora tutte le cose, le fa sembrare + belle

E il metodo più sicuro e come ogni cosa se fatta bene funzione se trascurata no.il preservativo invece se messo bene funziona ma ce sempre la possibilità che si rompa o dalla fretta o da qualsiasi altra cosa....meglio la pillola.....!!!e con la pillola di quelle che l hanno presa in modo giuso non ho sentito nessuno che è rimasta in cinta con il preservativo....ai voglia....ce chi la pillola la prende anche da 10 anni e non è mai succ niente!!!cmq il ginecologo consiglia la pillola.baci|`|vzontcRLaa	preservativo|`|xbgY7jZ5aa	Io sono un'ostetrica, quindi ti do un parere professionale..<br>  Ognuno ha pregi e difetti, per esempio.<br>  Il profilattico oltre che impedire gravidanze non diffonde malattie, e non altera l'equilibrio ormonale, però non è sicuro come la pillola e non regala le emozioni forti che si sentono senza.<br>  La pillola è comoda e più sicura, però sono ormoni che negli anni possono dare "malattie" o problemi, si rischia di dimenticarla e non protegge da malattie.<br>  La bilancia è quasi pari.<br>  Personalmente io preferisco il profilattico, gli ormoni preferisco non prenderli, però la scelta è personale, si devono conoscere pregi e difetti per poi scegliere quello che si preferisce.<br>  Io opto per il profilattico (meno epidemie inoltre).<br>  ciao

Poi l'ho fatto con un ragazzo che ho amato follemente ma che non mi ha mai voluta in realtà, lui era bello, affascinante intelligente, aveva tutto, ma proprio tutto, credevo che con lui avrei ragiunto l'orgasmo ma...quando lo vidi lì, grande e grosso con quella "punessa" mi sembrò proprio ridicolo, morale della favola non provai nulla, ma proprio nulla, era così piccolo che non riuscivo a sentirlo, adesso invece sto da 2 anni con il mio attuale ragazzo, lui è strafigo, dolce, intelligente, mooolto più di tutti, in più è super dotato e...con lui è veramente il massimo, raggiungo sempre l'orgasmo e mi piace da matti. Detto ciò ti dico che le dimensioni sono importanti ma devono anche essere accompagnate da un po' di fascino e un po' di savoir faire (saper fare) quindi...devi solo saper sfruttare tutto al meglio e di sicuro piacerai di più a chi ti troverà irresistibile già senza sapere cosa hai "sotto". ciao.|`|Yx73zECpaa	Per me personalmente sì, ma al contrario di quello che si pensa di solito.<br>  <br>  Nel senso non ho mai avuto uomini che non mi soddisfassero per la scarsa dimensione, invece ho avuto problemi contrari perchè io sono piuttosto corta e stretta e i rapporti diventavano difficili.|`|ct6cfRMbaa	le dimensioni contano tanto quanto conta saperlo usare.|`|v5ZUyCukaa	Nn tanto la lunghezza quanto lo spessore... eh bè si conta... chi direbbe di no..... cmq è sempre meglio preoccuparsi si saperlo usare.....!!!|`|7srwpHwXaa	non contano. dipende quanto ti attrae il tuo partner e la tua capacità di godere del sesso.|`|BlLVjdJ8aa	si sono importanti ma come un mucchio di altre cose quando si fa l'amore.<br>  l'errore che commette un gran numero di uomini è quello di credere che in un rapporto sessuale si debba "inserire e partire" ma non è così...<br>  lo sapete che possiamo raggiungere l'orgasmo anche senza penetrazione di alcunché?<br>  quindi se la tua preoccupazione è la dimensione io giocherei altre carte vincenti ad esempio la stimolazione clitoridea se sei bravo durante il rapporto vedrai che nessuno si lamenterà del tuo arnese.|`|FwoKBxuNaa	Ricorda sempre il detto: tutto conta ma niente è indispensabile.  Lo puoi applicare tranquillamente alla domanda da te posta.  Quindi, le dimensioni del pene sono importanti, ma senza esagerare.  La vagina femminile ha questa sua intrinseca elasticità che permette un ottimo rapporto sessuale per tutte le dimenzioni che vuoi.<br>  Ovvio che va considerato che questa elasticità non si presenta immediatamente e quindi ci vuole un po' prima che tutto l'impianto sessuale femminile si rilassi e che la zona venga irrorata adeguatamente dal liquido lenitivo che la vagina produce.  Ecco perchè sono importanti i preliminari.<br>  Un rapporto sessuale soddisfacente per la donna, non può durare (mediamente) meno di 20 minuti.  Ricorda poi che l' 85% degli uomini ha dimensioni comprese tra i 13 e i 16 centimetri. Quindi lascia perdere quelli che ce l'hanno più grosso e concentrati invece sul piacere che questo rapporto sessuale può darti e dare.  Tutto questo discorso che ti ho fatto è naturalmente "generalista".... ci sono poi donne che guardano solo alle dimensioni (da scansare accuratamente) e anche di quelle che si spaventano se ne vedono di troppo "ingimbranti".... quindi. Fai da te le tue considerazioni.<br>  Io ricorderò sempre un mio amico "superdotato" compagno di scuola, quanti problemi ha avuto a causa di queste "dimensioni".... Le ragazze lo scansavano tutte e ha avuto il suo primo rapporto sessuale a 25 anni, maturando nel frattempo una brutta depressione che si è tirato avanti per molti anni.  Come vedi ci sono sempre 2 lati della medaglia da considerare.|`|UTZ7NMI2aa	Non è importante quanto è grande il pene ma come lo sai usare.

A me viene molto prima il male al seno e appena mi finiscono le mie cose va via...il seno fa male, sembra leggermente più gonfio, lo senti "teso"...sono tutti avvertimenti che le tue cose stanno arrivando e quindi niente di preoccupante (pensa che il male al seno viene anche prendendo la pillola ed è capace di gonfiarsi di una o due taglie). Cmq se sul reggiseno hai visto delle macchie di sangue nn credo che la cosa sia normale..a me nn sono mai capitate. Nn cerdo tu sia incinta ma magari può essere altro..è sempre meglio andare dal medico per un controllo..giusto per essere sicura! =) Forse sono solo gli ormoni sballati..ti faranno fare un esame del sangue probabilmente.|`|60eHpUJ9aa	Francy stai tranqui nn è niente capita anke a me di avere dolori al seno..:) rilassati gioia..<br>  baci..<br>  sl ballerina;)|`|63a8422bfac1308e986b196e382b4be4aa	... che ti  faccia male il seno è possibile,é  normale...<br>  Ma le macchie di sangue addirittura no...<br>  Io ti consiglio d andare subito da uno specialista per farti controllare.<br>  Su Answer non puoi trovare risposte su questo molto esaurienti...|`|f1JBW7q6aa	mah io non ti so aiutare perchè sono un ragazzo,ma secondo me dovresti andare da un medico...chi meglio di lui ti sa dire di queste cose|`|2tBnJcT7aa	beh...a parte le macchie di dangue nel reggiseno...sembrerebbe semplicemente il tuo seno che continua a crescere....visto e considerato che hai ancora 13 anni e sei in pieno sviluppo...cmq ti consiglio di andare da un medico...|`|3BAaIw8yaa	Ciao,i dolori al seno sn NORMALISSIMI..però nn kapisco il xkè di qst "Makkie di sangue.."Diglielo a tua madre,ke ti prenderà subito 1 appuntamento dal ginecologo,così  ti potrà dire che cosa hai...<br>  Mi raccomando tu stai serena e tranquilla...Facci sapere...|`|4KBd0M20aa	il dolore al seno è una cosa normalissima tranquilla... però le macchie di sangue non tanto... ma non e che ti 6 tagliata o qualcosa del genere??|`|CYy5QKh7aa	per i dolori tutto nella norma... ma le macchie di sangue mi sembrano un pò strane!!|`|CaTEOyPoaa	tutto notmale tranne le macchie di sangue....io mi farei vedere da una ginecologa, cosa che comunque andrebbe fatta allo sviluppo per controllare se va tutto bene. non cercare su internet risposte che solo uno specialista puo' darti.la salute è troppo importante credimi.|`|DVJ5S5fvaa	E' normale che il seno ti faccia male sia quando il ciclo sta per iniziare che a quindici giorni circa di distanza, sei nel pieno dell'ovulazione probabilmente...tutto ok.<br>  L'unica cosa che non capisco è il sangue nel reggiseno...sei sicura? Parlane col tuo medico e stai tranquilla!|`|PomGOjvMaa	Ho già risposto alla prima domanda.......cmq ti dico che il sangue dal seno può essere dovuto ad uno sforzo particolarmente intenso tutto insieme perchè ho mio zio e una mia amica che corrono e quando fanno tragitti particolarmente lunghi gli esce del sangue......ma ti consiglio, per nn tenerti l'angoscia dentro di parlarne con tua madre e con il tuo medico che saprà dirti qualcosa di più e ti manderà a fare analisi specifiche......|`|cgtmNnqcaa	Ciao,<br>  inanzitutto devi pensare che ti son venute per la prima volta , quindi il tuo organismo è un pò sotto-sopra..e gli ormoni anche, il dolore al seno è del tutto normale e anche un eventuale irrigidamento (seno piu sodo del normale e dolore anche al solo tocco) perchè le ghiandole si ingrossano.<br>  x le macchie di sangue non saprei...vai dal dottore, pero non credo proprio che tu debba preoccuparti, per stare + tranquilla vai dal tuo medico!<br>  <br>  <br>  baci e fammi sapere!|`|25b6989b73b6135d7f408caae5292c49aa	nn ti preoccupare nn è 1 malattia....stai crescendo il seno ti può far male sempre nn x forza qnd hai ciclo o 6 nelle vicinanze....|`|6Of3dGPeaa	il dolore è normale, x le macchie non saprei...non ho mai sentito parlare di perdite... ma non credo proprio tu debba preoccuparti!non sarà niente di grave, parlane al tuo dottore!|`|98r78cT8aa	beh di ste makkie al toracce sinceramente mejo k t fai a veder!!..e poi ihih scsma meno male k nn hai avuto rapporti sai hai 13 anni!!...|`|9p0Q3ta1aa	ma xkè invece di kiederlo qui ke nn siamo dottori... nn vai da un ginecolgo nn ti mangia mica|`|HiULyGtFaa	Il fatto che il seno faccia male è assolutamente nella norma anche 15 giorni dopo il ciclo visto che hai appena iniziato. Ma se hai visto macchie di sangue sul reggiseno come hai scritto, consulta un ginecologo (tranquilla non ti deve fare la visita, ma può dirti cosa succede)!|`|sgolprmfaa	è normale ke il seno ti faccia male tranquilla! xò x le makkie di sangue nn ne sono sicura...prova a parlarne con tua madre e vai da un ginecologo!|`|xbgY7jZ5aa	Molto probabilmente è sintomo di ovulazione.. il seno risente molto degli influssi ormonali, sia nel periodo pre-mestruale che ovulatorio. Anche il fatto di avere delle perdite può essere una cosa normale, però visto che non è una regola vai a farti vedere o chiedi ad un consultorio, una ginecologa, vedrai che ti guarderanno e vedranno. Se ti può consolare, purtroppo, nelle malattie del seno maligne non c'è dolore.. quindi non preoccuparti. Appena puoi vai a controllarti, anche per tranquillità. Secondo me non hai niente. ciao<br>  se hai bisogno ci sono.|`|yakHt6Dsaa	oddio di solito dopo le mestruazioni il dolore sparisce, ma non mi preoccuperei per il male... piuttosto per le macchie di sangue.. visita un medico assolutamente!

In genere la pancia  comincia a vedersi intorno al 4° mese.|`|fBK1xxzraa	La mia ha incominciato a vedersi dal terzo mese. <br>  Diciamo che verso i 4 mesi e mezzo le persone che mi vedevano capivano subito che ero in dolce attesa. Poi dipende, ognuno di noi ha un fisico diverso. Una mia amica, per esempio, che è di costituzione robusta durante la gravidanza ha perso molti chili per via delle nausee e vomito, e fino al settimo mese nessuno avrebbe detto che era incinta.|`|xbgY7jZ5aa	Dipende, di solito a 4 mesi comincia a vedersi, però è relativo, se sei molto minuta anche a più..<br>  baci e auguri!
7d51f8db90bcdfa8a28f28e9bf28ff36aa	Dunque: la gravidanza ha una durata di 10 mesi lunari, formati da 4 settimane quindi da 28 giorni. Il ginecologo prende in considerazione questo tempo, considerando a termine o il mese lunare o il mese numerico. Tu prendi il mese numerico (come faccio io che finisco l'11), mentre loro prendono le settimane, quindi il mese lunare. Se ci fai caso ci sono 8 giorni fra il tuo conto e quello del ginecologo, esattamente come per il mio: io conto 11 lui conta 18. Quindi è solo diversa la "misura" che prendete in considerazione. Bacio|`|79c120aab65106c91b1e607e292292cfaa	I medici calcolano sempre dalla data del primo giorno dell'ultimo ciclo avuto, mentre in genere il concepimento avviene nei giorni piu' fertili che sono il 14 giorno da quella data piu' due prima e due dopo. Quindi, dal calcolo fatto dal tuo medico, in genere devi sempre togliere due settimane. Probabilmente fanno questi calcoli in base a parametri di crescita che devono controllare entro un dato periodo o forse perche' in teoria durante il ciclo e' impossibile rimanere incinta, ma non e' escluso se una ha una doppia ovulazione, cioe' che nel mentre un ovulo viene espulso col ciclo, se ne formi subito uno che quindi puo' venire fecondato.|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	forse ti riferisci al termine quando devi partorire...eh ragazzi io ci ho provato....ti chiedono di essere più chiara...ma come fai a essere più chara se non sai a cosa ti riferisci....se l'avessi saputo non avresti fatto la domanda.....|`|fohSd9SEaa	ma si , in base al regolo ostetrico e alla tua ultima mestruazione, per il ginecologo la data presunta del parto e' il 23.....per la tua data presunta personale , sinceramente non capisco proprio..... spiegati meglio!<br>  sasy|`|061f404148cb031ec48a4008d3e23952aa	Se intendi il termine della gravidanza, sento spesso questa differenziazione e devo dirti che non la capisco: i "tuoi" conti dovrebbero coincidere con i conti del ginecologo, uguali x tutte le donne del mondo, ossia la gravidanza dura 40 settimane dal primo giorno dell'ultima mestruazione.

9YC3wypFaa	Lo spermicida, sotto forma di crema, gel o schiuma è un agente capace di distruggere gli spermatozoi, viene usato come metodo contraccettivo in associazione con altri metodi di barriera, in particolare spirale e diaframma, usato solo non avrebbe una capacità anticoncezionale soddisfacente.<br>  <br>  Spesso viene venduto già applicato al contraccettivo associato, come nel caso dei profilattici spermicidi che contengono una sostanza spermicida sulla superficie.<br>  <br>  Alcuni studi dimostrano che l'uso della sostanza spermicida più diffusa, il nonoxynol-9, aumenterebbe il rischio di contagio dell'HIV e di altre malattie sessualmente trasmissibili poiché sarebbe causa di abrasioni sulla superficie vaginale in grado di facilitare la trasmissione del virus.<br>  <br>  Cosa sono gli spermicidi?<br>  <br>  Una donna usa gli spermicidi per uccidere lo sperma dell'uomo prima che la rende gravida. Gli spermicidi si trovano come schiume, gelatine, creme, compresse schiumose o supposte vaginali.<br>  <br>  Sono efficaci?<br>  Gli spermicidi sono efficaci se vengono usati correttamente ogni volta che si ha un rapporto sessuale.<br>  <br>  NOTA BENE:Gli spermicidi offrono più protezione contro l'ingravidamento e contro le malattie sessualmente trasmissibili quando vengono usati con i profilattici. Gli spermicidi possono offrire protezione contro alcune malattie sessualmente trasmissibili, ma non è stato dimostrato che esse siano protettive contro l'infezione HIV. A prescindere dall'astinenza, i profilattici di lattice offrono la migliore protezione contro queste infezioni.<br>  <br>  Come funzionano?<br>  Mettete lo spermicida nella vostra vagina prima che l'uomo inserisca il suo pene. Seguite le istruzioni sulla confezione e assicuratevi di usare lo spermicida ogni volta che avete un rapporto sessuale.<br>  <br>  Come si usano gli spermicidi?<br>  <br>  Come con qualunque altro metodo, dovreste parlare con il vostro medico di fiducia o con un consulente di pianificazione demografica presso una clinica o un ospedale prima di usare gli spermicidi come metodo di contraccezione. Vi forniamo pertanto le seguenti istruzioni per aiutarvi a decidere se gli spermicidi sono giusti per voi.<br>  <br>      * Usate gli spermicidi ogni volta che avete rapporti sessuali.<br>      * Dovete inserire la schiuma, la gelatina, o la crema nella parte più interna della vagina appena prima del rapporto sessuale.<br>      * Dovete inserire le compresse o le supposte 10 minuti prima del rapporto sessuale.<br>      * Se più di un'ora passa prima di avere rapporti sessuali, usare una seconda dose di spermicidi.<br>      * Assicurarsi di inserire una nuova compressa, supposta, o un'applicazione di schiuma, gelatina, o crema per ogni atto sessuale aggiuntivo. <br>  <br>  Come inserire la schiuma<br>  <br>      * Lavare le mani con sapone.<br>      * Agitare violentemente il recipiente in modo tale da miscelare adeguatamente il contenuto.<br>      * Riempire l'applicatore premendo sull'estremità del recipiente di schiuma.<br>      * Collocare l'applicatore nella vagina. Quindi premere sul diffusore in modo tale che la schiuma vada nella vagina. <br>  <br>  Cura e conservazione della schiuma<br>  <br>      * Lavare l'applicatore della schiuma dopo l'uso, usando il sapone.<br>      * Mantenere un contenitore di schiuma disponibile a casa. Di solito è impossibile prevedere quando la schiuma finisce. <br>  <br>  Come inserire le compresse o le supposte<br>  <br>      * Lavare le mani con sapone.<br>      * Usare le dita medio e indice per mettere la compressa o la supposta in profondità nella vagina. <br>  <br>  Effetti collaterali<br>  <br>  Se avete irritazione nella vostra vagina, consultate un medico, assicurandovi di dirgli che state usando gli spermicidi, prima di interrompere l'applicazione di questo metodo.<br>  <br>  Altre istruzioni<br>  <br>  Interrompete l'applicazione di spermicidi se:<br>  <br>      * Non siete contenti di questo metodo.<br>      * Pensate di essere incinta.<br>      * Volete conoscere o iniziare un altro metodo sulla limitazione delle nascite<br>      * Pensate che vi siano possibilità di essere esposti ad una infezione HIV oppure a qualunque altra malattia sessualmente trasmissibile. <br>  <br>  Quali sono i vantaggi e gli svantaggi degli spermicidi?<br>  <br>  Vantaggi:<br>  <br>      * Gli spermicidi possono offrire protezione contro alcune malattie sessualmente trasmissibili.<br>      * Gli spermicidi possono essere interrotti dalla donna di sua iniziativa.<br>      * Gli spermicidi sono disponibili senza ricetta e senza visita medica. <br>  <br>  Svantaggi:<br>  <br>      * Non è stato dimostrato che gli spermicidi proteggano contro l'infezione HIV.<br>      * Gli spermicidi possono causare l'irritazione nella vagina in alcune donne o sul pene per alcuni uomini.<br>      * L'inserimento dello spermicida o l'attesa dell'azione delle compresse spermicide può interrompere l'atto sessuale.<br>      * Le scorte di spermicidi possono essere costosi e difficili da trovare. <br>  <br>  Gli spermicidi sono il giusto metodo per me?<br>  <br>  Vi sono fattori che dovrebbero essere considerati prima di decidere se gli spermicidi sono il giusto metodo contraccettivo per voi. Come con qualsiasi contraccezione, dovete discutere con il vostro medico o con un medico presso un ospedale o una clinica prima di usare gli spermicidi come un metodo contraccettivo.<br>  <br>  Gli spermicidi possono essere un metodo adatto per voi<br>  Se una delle seguenti condizioni è vera:<br>  <br>      * Preferite un metodo che potete interrompere di vostra iniziativa.<br>      * Voi avete bisogno di un metodo di riserva (per esempio, nel caso dimentichiate di prendere i contraccettivi orali).<br>      * Possiedete precauzioni mediche per l'uso di altri metodi contraccettivi.<br>      * Siete preoccupati degli effetti collaterali di altri metodi.<br>      * Avete rapporti sessuali solo occasionalmente.<br>      * Voi e il vostro partner volete condividere la responsabilità di fare un figlio e la prevenzione di malattie sessualmente trasmissibili.<br>      * Siete appena usciti da una gravidanza.<br>      * Avete appena abortito. <br>  <br>  Gli spermicidi possono non essere un metodo adatto per voi<br>  Se una delle seguenti condizioni è vera:<br>  <br>      * Siete a rischio di esposizione o di trasmissione di malattie sessualmente trasmissibili, inclusa l'infezione HIV. Gli spermicidi possono offrire protezione contro alcune malattie sessualmente trasmissibili, ma non è stato dimostrato che esse siano protettive contro l'infezione HIV.<br>      * A prescindere dall'astinenza, i profilattici di lattice offrono la migliore protezione contro queste infezioni.<br>      * Pianificate di usare gli spermicidi frequentemente o in grandi quantità. In queste condizioni, gli spermicidi possono causare irritazione della vagina. L'irritazione e le ferite nella vagina possono aumentare il rischio di infezione da HIV.<br>      * Non potete sempre inserire lo spermicida prima di ogni rapporto sessuale.|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	ti hanno già risposto....|`|53d915ea34cbdc8bea9cd1ace11c49d8aa	dal commercio...I FURBI.<br>  Ovviamente di conseguenza hanno smesso di vendere i diaframmi, che senza l'abbinamento crema SONO INUTILI, INEFFICACI.<br>  Se usato correttamente, della misura giusta che deve dire il ginecologo/a, inserito bene (te lo insegna la ginecologa/o, con la crema, il diaframma e' sicuro all'800%...per quel 20 per cento...occorre anche misurare la temperatura basale...<br>  con questi due metodi insieme si ha copertura 100%.<br>  Ammetto che ad alcune PILLOLARE come ero io, inizialmente puo' dare fastidio...ma io senza pillola ho inziato ad avere sensazioni molto piu' VERE..prima ero un po' anestetizzata (l'ultimo anno di assuzione pillola..), ma questa e' solo una mia sensazione.<br>  <br>  Per avere diaframma+crema, devi rivolgerti all'estero!<br>  Un diaframma ben tenuto dura 6/8 mesi se non di piu'.<br>  Se hai un amico all'estero e' fatta.

Ti dico voler bene e nn amore perchè l'amore è ben difficile provarlo con il primo ragazzo. Di solito si crede che sia amore perchè ti sembra di nn aver mai provato sensazioni simili ma poi andando avanti ti accorgi che non è così..che esistono persone migliori e esistono sensazioni ed emozioni più intense! La mia prima volta è stata con un ragazzo a cui volevo bene si ma nn lo amavo e me ne sono accorta dopo quando ho incontrato il mio attuale amore. <br>  Per il fatto di farlo con un ragazzo che si incontra in discoteca sono assolutamente contraria essendo una ragazza motlo all'antica...io in dicoteca nn ci sono mai andata e nemmeno vorrò andarci. Preferisco andare in piscina con il mio fidanzato o di sera al parco a cocccolarci. Cmq a parte il fatto che nn vado in disco...io se fossi in te nn lo fare! Nn rovinerei un momento importante in questo modo..mai e poi mai!

Ti fa soffrire come una cagna, ti fanno i punti lo stesso (per di più ti tagliano senza anestesia, tanto il male è forte che non te ne rende neanche conto!) e possono comunque esserci delle complicazioni.<br>  Con il cesareo fai anestesia peridurale, vede tuo figlio nascere, non soffre né prima né dopo e i punti si cicatrizzano prima, visto che restano asciutti (i punti sotto restano sempre umidi per via della mestruazione pos-parto e fanno fatica a cicatrizzare) e sei sempre sotto controllo medico. Resti un paio di giorni in più all'ospedale, ma è solo per scrupoli da possibili infezioni, per via della chirurgia.<br>  Nessun dolore, né prima né dopo! <br>  Recupero perfetto e comuque non ci tenevo proprio ad uscire camminando dalla sala operatoria! Niente di meglio che un buon riposino dopo il parto.

1f4144176dd3321ffc893cea07bd83bdaa	One of my pregnancy book states that the difference between pre-menstrual breasts and pregnancy breasts is that in early pregnancy breasts become slightly swollen, where as pre-menstrual breasts may simply become sore...but NOT swollen. I hope this helps as its often so hard for women to decifer whether their breasts are sore because of periods or pregnancy. What i have just stated was true for me....each month before I was due on i would get really sore breasts for about a week, but when i was pregnant they were not only sore but swollen too (and yes impossible to sleep on) Do you have any other symptoms?

Good luck!|`|308zHVCkaa	Don't get yourself in high hopes that you are pregnant just yet, if you miss your period, I would suggest taking a pregnancy test.  But, if this is not the norm for you, then you maybe pregnant.  Usually, they say, that when you get pregnant, you have a slight instinct that you are since you know what is not normal to you, and what is.  Good luck, if you are trying to get pregnant. :)
3Ks21ASDaa	Get an ovulation predictor, the stick things that are sold near the pregnancy tests. You pee on it everyday of your cycle and it tells you when you are ovulating. Or you could check your basal body temperature and see when it spikes, that is when you are ovulating. You could always take prenatal vitamins. Just keep trying! It's not easy!|`|C4ibOR7Laa	go and see a doctor, they will give you medication to regulate you period and get you to ovulate|`|ZpLCfeRYaa	I am currently trying to have a baby.

YVBXMghXaa	If you do go to the fire department, be sure you ask if there is a "certified child passanger safety technician."  Many fire departments will check your seat, but are not technically certified to do so and may not know everything.  For example, they told me I could use my son's seat after it was in an accident, which I now know is completely unsafe.<br>  Babies R Us or other children's stores will frequently do check events.  I would call them to see if they are hosting one soon.  The people that perform those checks are true professionals and are passionate about carseat safety.  I went to one when I was pregnant and was amazed at how much I learned.  You may also be able to check safekids.org for upcoming events in your area.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Most fire departments do this. Call up your local one beforehand and check, though.|`|SeAvCGlYaa	Your local fire department or police station will inspect it for you and correct any mistakes. They can also just install it for you and tell you if the seat has been recalled or not.|`|u94HOVz7aa	in washington state you can go to any police station and ask an they will inspect that it is installed correctly. you can try that if they don't do it they should be able to tell you were you can|`|DKfScL8taa	The hospital will inspect it before they let you take your baby home.

I did our inspection at the hospital where I live.  They have a person who does this full time. They will give you grip pads or even water noodles and stuff to make sure the car seat is in perfect position and is tight.  It is quite the process.  <br>  <br>  Also, baby stores like Babies-r-us often have community classes they offer on all sorts of fun baby stuff.  They would have a class on car seat safety and checking.  <br>  <br>  Like others said, fire department, police station, the city womens and children's clinic...ect.|`|dWJdUw8Qaa	If you have a babies r us they normal do a program 1 sat a mth to have someone check it for you.|`|c6bde8f9a87bbbe5e37ddc75d9270523aa	I had the local Fire Department install mine.

It actually takes a pretty significant dose of ibuprofen to cause toxicity (about 100mg/pound) and there is only 200 mg in an Advil tablet.  So unless you child only weighs 2 pounds, he'll be fine.  Kids are a lot craftier than we give them credit for most of the time, so be sure to keep the meds out of reach in the future!|`|a0cf466e46f40d4ab5c32d656a4a89f6aa	How old is your son??

Let them have something thin to cover up with and no fan at night! :)<br>  <br>  Just in case your super worried, right before bed time take their temp.. after all precautions if the temperature hasn't broke.. you should contact your general physician or go to your local hospital.<br>  <br>  Make sure the child is well hydrated :)|`|7a21abcf50668faa413ff2b682d8ddc2aa	make sure they are not sleeping in pj's that are to warm. and tylenol or motrin works for my peanuts
4gZYucHMaa	Having a safe place for your child to roam is always a plus, just make sure it's not a door locked.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	You need to start teaching your child, what is touchable and not touchable.<br>  ( Connie Mom of 4 )|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	If he is anything like my 12 month old, he won't like it, lol.  I tried to put my son in his room w/ the baby gate up once when I was home alone and needed to take the dogs out.  He was NOT happy; I doubt I'd try it again.  Just baby-proof everything and let him explore, it's the best thing for him.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Baby gates are a good idea - not sure why the other poster got a thumbs down for that one. <br>  <br>  I, for one, though, would LOVE to have a designated play room for the kids. Not necessarily to 'lock them up,' although if he's safe there's probably nothing wrong with it - but a place to put all the toys so they can spread out, make a mess and have fun. It's hard when they're that age because they are into EVERYTHING and are probably climbers, too. As long as you're interacting with your child and paying attention to him, you can easily put him in the play room with his toys and let him rip. That way he can't really hurt anything, he's safe and you're relatively sane from not having to worry about what he may or may not be putting into the light socket. LOL (hopefully not!)|`|T864ejaiaa	teach him not to touch things he shouldn't touch. you can also give him a play room. this way he will learn to keep his things in his play room. good luck. oh and don't lock him in the room.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Personal choice. I believe they should roam freely around the house. I have seen many family's who have a playroom. It doesn't really make a difference as long as it works for you.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	When my son was two years old and my daughter was 3 months old we moved into a house that had a designated "play room".  This made keeping the other rooms in the house tidy a much easier task.  I did not shut the door or gate the room, the kids were pretty good about playing in the play room, seeing as how ALL the toys were in there.  In the other parts of the house, they were taught what they were allowed to touch or not touch and basically it worked well all the way around.  In our current house there is no one designated play room and the kids have most of their toys in their bedrooms.  This makes it difficult when friends or cousins come over to play because the bedrooms get TRASHED and even though the kids clean/tidy up, later I will have to go in and help sort the toys....legos in the lego bin, transformers in the transformer bin, barbies in the barbie bin etc.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	it depends on whats easier for you and safe for your son. a friend of mine has a specific room with all her child's toys in it and when she plays she goes directly into that room. it contains the child and the mess. my living room and 'dining room' are child proofed. the dining room is REALLY a play room it's all toys so i know its safe for her to run around and play. if you think your son is in danger of getting into something he shouldn't running free then i don't see an issue with letting him have a play room.|`|1xlV9l0saa	If you have the money....buy 2 Playyard supergates and connect them together to make a huge play area in the living room or where ever. I did it and it was lots of room to play with big and little toys and her 4 year old brother would go in and play as well. I understand and you kinda have to do this to keep your sanity. People dont understand what all these adventurous kids can get into....and the dangers of it. I have left for less than 10 seconds and my 14 month old was standing on a table and a TV could have fallen on her. It scared me to death. She will push toys over to climb onto things....I have tried child proofing my whole home and am still trying.<br>  Good Luck!|`|45nSn7Rcaa	How about teaching him where he can and can not go and what he is allowed to touch and not touch. . All three of our kids knew these things...we of course took care of dangerous things like knives, cleaning supplies and drugs,,,they were where the children could not get them, but otherwise, they knew their boundaries..Children are very smart and quick to understand.  Just be firm and consistant about your expectations and set limits.<br>  <br>  I'll quickly tell you how we taught our children to stay out of the kitchen...it was a seperate small room with only one doorway so no one had to go through it to get to another room.  For a couple weeks we kept a board in the doorway and told them they could not go past that spot...after we took it away...they would stand with theri toes right at the door jam, but they would never even spill over into the kitchen by even a centimetre...they never had to be told.  They would lean in and reach out for their bottle to be handed to them, but thier toes stayed out...it was so cute.|`|UTb5chyJaa	EVEN IF SOME PARENTS THINK ITS MEAN, I HAVE TO SAY THAT I THINK THE PLAYROOM IDEA IS A GREAT ONE. IT IS HARD TO KEEP CONSTANT WATCH OVER A 12 MONTH OLD. I HAVE AN 18 MONTH OLD DAUGHTER AND SHE DOES HAVE TIME WHEN SHE IS IN HER ROOM WITH THE PLAYGATE UP. I THINK IT'S DANGEROUS TO LET A 1 YEAR OLD HAVE RUN OF THE HOUSE, THERE IS SO MUCH THEY CAN GET INTO. SO UNLESS YOU CAN SIT THERE AND STARE AT YOUR BABY, GO WITH THE PLAYROOM IDEA. NOT ALL DAY BT ATLEAST LONG ENOUGH TO GET SOME HOUSEWORK DONE OR HAVE A LITTLE DOWN TIME, YOU KNOW YOU DESERVE IT!!! GOOD LUCK AND I HOPE I HELPED.|`|DDFSITiYaa	I do a combination - there are times I need to restict them to the family room and keep them safe and other times they are free to explore.

UBP3SNlGaa	Pues si quiza ya tienes la idea de como es estar con el y cuando lo ves con otra persona pues te da cierto coraje o celos porque pues el antes estaba asi contigo y pues a lo mejor como estas solita pues piensas que ahora te quedaste sin nadie y que estar sin nadie o con el mejor con el, pero como dices que te sientes asfixiada con el pues entonces si no creo que haya amor en esa relacion mas bien es el saber que el esta contigo en un momento y eso te da cierta seguridad y por eso dura tan poco el tiempo en que estan a gusto los dos. eso creo yo.:D suerte.|`|321a485828a9e9c768182655eaf767efaa	se quieren traten de cambiar un poco los dos|`|pbd2NbARaa	creo que mas bien es costumbre, pero terminen la relación de novios y sigan como buenos amigos|`|84bbd44fac49b71aeb53bea7dceeddb4aa	Puede ser q seas un poco obsesiva con el por eso no soportas verlo con alguien mas, lo q no has dicho es lo amas? creo q no lo amas, lo queres pero nada mas y no te acostumbras a estar sin el y no soportas q el este con alguien, deberias intentar estar con alguien asi poder despegarte de el y ver q sentis realmente.<br>  Suerte|`|cjj1dHecaa	es costumbre,<br>  tienes que salir con mas amigos, y hacer tu vida aparte de el, si el sale con otras es xq tu no le interesas mucho como el a ti, tal ves tu no has sido la unica novia para el al principio y bueno ..<br>  Eso me paso a mi ... estuve 6 anos con un ni?o y terminabamos el salia con otras chicas cuando no estabamos lo cual me daba muchos celos, pero al final decidi terminar con el, y salir con otros ni?os y ahora estoy con uno que me quiere me respecta y es mil veces mejor que el anterior ... es dificil y muy duro tratar de sacar al ex de tu cabeza y a veces piensas que nunca se va pero ahora en mi caso mi nuevo novio a sabido tapar lo que sentia por mi ex y ahora soy muy feliz... te lo recomiendo muchisimo!! espero lo puedas hacer|`|eMOz1jo0aa	Que barbara! Vivimos exactamente la misma situacion, yo estuve en ese mismo dilema hace ya casi 4 a?os. Yo me di cuenta que ya no lo amaba, pero que despues de 5 a?os siempre queda ese cari?o y esa peque?a culpa de no querer hacerle da?o. Me di cuenta que no podia estar con el mas y que ya no queria perder mi tiempo. Sabia que ya no ibamos a llegar a ningun lado, pero tampoco me atrevia a decirle, simplemente seguia con la costumbre. Tambien fue mi primer novio, y pues yo creia que iba a ser el amor de mi vida y que iba a estar con el para siempre. Pero fue algo que idealice. Me tarde en terminar la relación mas de un a?o. Durante un a?o completo me decia "hoy si le digo" y al final no me atrevia. Afortunadamente me arme de valor y se lo dije sin mas. Desde ese dia NUNCA MAS lo volvi a ver, ni a llamar ni a saber de el, sobre todo para darme cuenta si en realidad lo queria o si era solo costumbre. Afortunadamente lo hice a tiempo, y me di la oportunidad de conocer al verdadero amor de mi vida y ahora tengo 2 a?os de feliz matrimonio. Te digo, tu tienes la respuesta en tu corazon, solo atrevete a escucharlo y haz lo que tengas que hacer!|`|niup64Lpaa	Pienso que lo que te pasa es que tienes cierta dependencia emocional, pero lo que te aconsejo es que trates de seguir tu vida, conocer más gente, tienes toda la vida por delante para conocer mas chicos de tu edad. Recuerda que el noviazgo es una relación para conocerse, ver que tan compatible y feliz eres con tu pareja. Si sientes que te asfixia y luego de terminar quieres regresar. Eso definitivamente no es amor, es cari?o, dependencia, costumbre. Vive la vida aprende a disfrutar tu juventud, que ya te llegará la hora que un hombre realmente se gane tu corazón....|`|RWtLmaSkaa	Yo creo que como fue tu unico amor te has quedado estancada  y piensas que si no es con el no podras estar con nadie mas,,  pero todo eso es solo psicologico,, intenta salir de su circulo ,, y  no vuelvas con el  en un largo tiempo  pero date el gusto de salir con mas chicos  veras como  todo se puede conseguir  sin ser rutinario, y a lo mejor encuentras la felicidad  pues por lo que cuentas ya no estas enamorada de el solo sientes  algo de cari?o por que el  fue el primero. siempre hay algo esperando fuera.Suerte|`|c7Qd8aiyaa	Ya se te hizo kostumbre, mejor trata de konocer mas gente, saludos|`|xv3y6jZpaa	creo k es costumbre,, y como ha sido tu primer novio stas clavadisima con el...
