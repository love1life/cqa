I'm a college student and currently taking up BS in Computer Science.   I want to know which degree is better, BS in Information Technology or BS in Computer Science? I want to know which one would give me more job opportunities after graduating.      I really need to know if its worth to finish BsComsci than BSIT because BsComsci in our school takes 4yrs to finish and BSIT takes 2and a half to 3yrs only.      I don't want to waste time and money if both are almost the same and if both will give the same opportunities when I graduate.      Actually I shifted to ComSci from IT (I'm almost finished in IT)   Should I finish IT first or should I continue with Comsci??      Which one is better when it comes to job opportunities? I need to know.      Please help.      Thanks in advance guys!      =)

I have a Toshiba Portege M800/M800D (that's what it says on the instruction manual anyway), and yesterday the little touch buttons/ light things at the top (the ones that mute, open media player/DVD, and play, stop, next, etc) stopped working. i didn't do anything to it to make it do this (at the time i think i was checking my emails). and i don't know whats wrong! i tried restarting it a couple of times, but nothing worked.    also sometimes, the fingerprint scanner randomly doesn't work. and there used to be a function on the mouse pad thingy where it scrolled down, but that stopped working maybe a month and a half ago   the laptop is fairly new (i got it for christmas), and has never been dropped or anything. In fact, i don't think it has left my desk at all!   i can live without these little touch light thingys (even though they were really useful) and the fingerprint scanner and stuff, but its really irritating! i would appreciate any help anyone can give me, because the other alternative is to take it back i guess, but i really don't want to have to move all my files to another computer and everything.

My first problem, Google or any other major search engine always brings up the wrong site when I click on a link. The opened website opens in a new window and the address that pops up is www.go.google(or msn etc.)and then random stuff. My next problem is anti-spyware, adware, and virus programs. I believe that some sort of adware, virus, or spyware is causing the search engines to do what there doing but, whenever i try to go to that programs website its blocked or something. Last problem, whenever  I do manage to get one of those programs installed its says it doesn't have a connection to the internet, which I clearly do since I'm typing this. I've just recently hooked up a D-Link wireless G router. I've tryed to install Spybot, Ad-Aware, and I had Cogeco security installed. All of them either the websites doesn't show up or they can't connect to the internet. Any ideas, I know its a big problem.

So basically i started a scan with norton and just glanced at what file it was scanning and it looked like a strange named file 'W32.Mytob.BE@mm' and i didnt find it really strage until norton was scanning it for about a couple of minutes so i did a google search and this came up:    http://www.symantec.com/security_respons...

20090219175552AAszlfL	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Can't watch fullscreen video?	About a month ago, I purchased a brand new HP G60-243cl that comes with 3gigs of ram, an AMD Turion 64x2 RM-72 2.1 Ghz processor, and Windows Vista. When I try to watch full screen flash video from just about any site except youtube, the frame rate on the video becomes choppy, to the point where it seems more like a slide show with music and dialogue. Now, I also hook my laptop to an HDTV via HDMI. So, this presents a problem as I cannot watch decent quality video on my big screen. Reading up on specs, I found out that the NVIDIA 8200M that came equipped with the laptop should be able to handle some pretty beefy stuff, but it can't seem to handle full screen, 16:9 streaming video in a decent quality.

As the title states, Media player doesn't open when I go directly to the file.  I can open Media Player directly, then open the file from within the window that way, but I don't want to have to do this permanently.      I ran a piece of software to clean the registry up a bit for me, so I'm assuming that's the problem, but the file association for WMP is still fine.      If I double-click the icon, absolutely nothing happens, but when I right-click the file and select open with Windows Media Player, a box is displayed saying "The Parameter is incorrect".      I wish to avoid reinstalling Vista, even if it means there's no solution and I'll have to deal with opening WMP, then loading the files.      Thanks in advance to anyone who can help :)

If I look at the profile of someone who is not set to private, is there any way of them telling that me 'Cynthia Bailey' - looked at their profile...???  Coz I have had several offers (via facebook,) to join a page that gives you an 'application' that makes you see who has looked at your profile.        So if me - Cynthia Bailey - looks at someone's profile, is it possible that they can see I have been looking?  I have been nosing once or twice at the facebook profiles of a couple of people who I used to get on with, and have nothing to do with anymore, including a couple of extended family members, and I just wondered; can they see I have been snooping and does it leave an IP address of who has looked??        So even if I made up a fake profile to look, would it give the ip address, so they would be able to link it back to me?  Thanks everyone.

I was in the middle of working with MS Word on Sunday when my computer started to make a loud whining sound.  It then froze for a few minutes, the screen starting making these odd waving ripples, and then the computer shut down.  When it tried to start up again, it said "error could not load OS" (or something to that effect).  I tried hitting the restart button, but the error message popped up again.  I then shut down the surge protector and restarted, and everything was fine.  I was just sitting at my computer (Friday), and it started to whine and froze once again.  However, it did not shut down, and unfroze after about one minute.  I have heard this whining noise in the past, but it was always at night while I was going to sleep, not on the computer (i.e. there was no computer activity), so I never realized that there was anything to be worried about.  Is my power supply going, or does the fan just need a good cleaning, and is there any diagnostic software that will let me know?

I have a Dell XPS M1530 (4GB RAM, 256MB 8600M GT, 2.0 GHZ Dual Core), which I have linked up to my HDTV - Running Windows 7 beta.      I would like to play 1080p resolution .mkv videos on my TV and have CoreAVC/Haali/AC3 codecs installed, and added to Media Player Classic using the external filters addon, and set to preferred.   However, it would seem that MPC doesn't actually use them, as the icons for CoreAVC/Haali never appear in my system tray.    The video is choppy and loses audio sync very quickly.      CoreAVC/Haali do however load on Windows Media Player, which plays the videos fine for a couple of minutes, before processor usage spikes for some reason, and then the video becomes incredibly choppy and unwatchable.      Is there something I am missing when setting these up? Or is my laptop simply incapable of playing the videos?      (I'm not entirely sure this is the right section to ask, but I couldn't really find anything more appropriate)

It had bobby mcferrin's Dont worry be happy playing in the background:       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8cyFg5iF...       So. Should I go ahead and file a dispute saying that it is "Fair use" since it only uses 1min 38 sec of the audio?   Is it a good idea?      Cheers.

Basically i am just wondering if it could even survive being put through the trash process..it was just a small laptop hard drive outside of its case..usually if you just drop them they are toast. i also heard the trash from my town goes to the local power plant to be incincerated so the only chance it could have been found is point a to point b. What do you guys think?      I cant seem to get these thoughts out of my head and this has completely taken over my life..any help would be great i am really suffering here, i just really dont know what else to do..i am on paxil and have considered therapy but i dont know if that will even help me..       I have always had obsessions throughout my life. But not one that has gripped one so violently like this. I am sure people are sick of seeing me ask this, but it is theraputic for me to get reassurance, although i know it is not a solution. I guess i just feel silly seekign therapy for something so ridiculous. It is embarrassing.      I want to try and get over this without going to therapy, i am just not sure how.      Should i seek therapy? I have already checked my credit report and what not, but i always seem to just tell myself it just hasnt happened YET

However i wanted to check for others so i did a scan with AVG. (The free version) And i'm also using spy bot. Is this a bad combo? Should i stick to one or the other? As each in turn find different things. So seems like they not fully picking up things. So they low threats but Norton doesn't always pick them up. Any advice?Thank you-x

I have been using a asus wireless router (also connected up to my desktop) to create a wireless network so i can get internet on my laptop. The laptop receives the connection through a Belkin wireless G notebook network card. I want to be able wirelessly print from my laptop. On my desktop I have been into control panel and enabled the printer for shared printing on my network I have also checked the actual network is set up to support this and it is. What I want to know is how do I set up the connection on  my laptop so i can start printing, I have all the software disks etc. ready if I need them. Just to clarify the notebook card and router is already set up and working, just need to sort the printer. By the way, The desktop is running vista and the laptop is running XP if that makes any difference. Can anyone tell me what to do on the laptop or a link to some instructions or something. Thanks.

Yes I know the VC isn't a top line one. I don't plan on devoting 18 hours of my day towards PC games. lol. I just need a really good power supply Company that doesn't have a 20% rate of DOA and KIA within the first 6 months.      I don't want to underpower my card but I don't want to spend an arm and leg on some monster, but I'm not going to put some company's PSU in that has a history of frying MoBos, HDD, and DVD/RW's.       WoW is the most graphically demanding game I run which my stock 300w supply is able to handle but I'd rather be safe than sorry since I'm going from onboard graphics to a card.      If you need to know the wattage I'm looking at, it's about 430w-450w.      Do NOT suggest a newegg or tigerdirect website unless you are showing a specific company. That just shows you're retarded. I'm not asking WHERE. I'm asking WHO.

Antivirus software helps to protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. Click here for the scan you computer. Your system might be at risk now." Every misspelling and grammar problem, included. I'm feeling that this isn't very trustworthy.      But I can't seem to get rid of it.      My other virus protection has found threats, too. Namely, Trokan horse SHeur2.rcp, which will not be deleted. It says the threat file cannot be found. Other alerts continually pop up from the Spyware Protect 2009. Again, I did NOT download this agent! I have not been on any sites or opened any e-mails that are unusual for me to visit. Spyware protect seems to be a real product, however, I'm willing to bet that this avenue to it is the kind that steals identities, if it already hasn't.      Please help.

I have been able to successfully connect my laptop to our other tv, a HD sony bravia, but for some reason i can't get it to work on my LG. What am i doing wrong? I am on the HDMI/DVI station but it continually says "no signal". However, i have noticed that when i change the settings on my laptop to try to get the picture to show up on my tv, the screen flickers, like my laptop does, but it doesn't show anything.

20090220072734AAt1mCr	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Problem with css in ie7 only!?	I am having a huge problem with the css in ie7 only. I'm sure there is something simple that I am over looking but After hours of looking everything becomes a blur and nothing makes sence anymore. The divs are like most other sites in which they are surrounded by a wrapper and the inside divs are aligned to push each other down based on content. However, in ie7 the last div (footer) is not being pushed down. It floats right where the div before it (right nav) is coded. What this causes is the effect that a footer is floating right through the page's content. However when I look at the page in firefox or chorme, this doesnt happen, the footer is right at the bottom where it belongs.      At the moment there is no content in the footer so everything is a solid blue. If you look at the page in firefox, you will see a blue gap at the bottom of the page. Then look at it in ie7 and it looks like a section of the page was cut off, but its the footer, by scrolling down you will see that the bottom gap is gone (it being the footer).      The site can be seen at  http://www.wpef.johnarcin.com       This is driving me nuts!! please help!   Thanks.
