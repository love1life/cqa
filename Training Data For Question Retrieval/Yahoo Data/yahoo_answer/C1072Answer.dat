Nd0emY3aaa	Well I have some insight to this being a communication major. The reason the media mentions Dante Anderson is to attract people to the tragedy in the first place. Curtis, as good as a person may be, who knows he was probably a saint compared to Dante, but the truth is Curtis is relatively unknown vs. Dante.        Yes it is sad that the media works this way but in the end it's about generating interest, and sadly Dante is the star who garners the attention between these two individuals. Morally, it is somewhat wrong but in terms of business the media is doing the right thing as disgusting as this may sound. Hopefully, both families recover, and may these kids find safe passage on the otherside.|`|bd01ospUaa	yes

Professional sports is very narrow-minded and downright homophobic.  Players, coaches, broadcasters, etc., may not publicly admit this, but it is very true - and every so often one player somewhere will attest to this with very homophobic comments.    Therefore, I guess the only way for you to find out is to either hit on him (if you are a man) or wait until his playing days are done and see if he finally admits to it.|`|9a96c16c0198472f7be2f301ab1a29f5aa	Yea i ****** him the other day.  what a night|`|9dO5jV8yaa	prolly not. but he does have that caveman forehead and brow|`|AA10461789	No, but he could double as Ashton Kutcher if he wanted to...|`|K7H9N0gWaa	I hope so!|`|c52YzAi7aa	kyle korver is like my boyfriend

fb2bc5066e973c116ece4c08fc55a9d2aa	regardless of how he was at his job,which is what wrestling is, he killed his family.  How any human being can say how great a man he was is incredible. I watched last night WWE and saw interview after interview about what a great man he was and how he loved his kids......for egads...folks he killed one of his kids! If he had simply killed himself, sure i would not comment on this...but he killed his family....and to think even the WWE (which I am sure they knew what had happended by showtime last night)  Had this 3 hour show dedicated to a man who killed his family.....what has this country come to?

M6oxi7YFaa	Hornswoggle winning the Cruiserweight Title was funny and unexpected, Cena retaining sucked, he needs to lose that title and go back to Smackdown and his old ways, Khali barely got the World Title so it was expected that he would retain, hope Kane gets another title shot at the next Pay-Per-View, and winning the Title and keeping it until Undertakers return, KANE vs UNDERTAKER for the World Title would be a great match, yes Orton deserves to be the WWE Champion, hes beaten alot of legendes and has not gotten a one on one title shot, The Pay-Per-View was below average compared to the Great American Bash Last Year.|`|wlUlTKhuaa	Orton will win...then lose to HHH at the next PPV just like he won the title from benoit lol|`|AT8I8Tkraa	IT SUCKED|`|AA11882000	It sucked! Only one championship changed hands, and that was only the Crusierweight Championship.|`|92106e9af0237649a4e844f66cfd557faa	I'm upset. look i like cena, but it just sucks because I know in my heart lashley deserved to win it. yeah u have been saying that cena is going to win and his downfall will be in summerslam and u know what i agree, but there are doubts. he's been put with the best and has never lost. he will loose even though i love the man i must say. I'm still sad =((LOL), but he will lose. Khali sucks and he will lose it soon. yeah u were right I'm admitting it.=P.lol|`|lW1cDqCeaa	It sucks. Cena Sucks|`|4ZmcEq4Paa	i agree|`|J2GruOFOaa	I thought it was better then average.    Morrison, MVP and Hornswaggle all won, which is good.  Khali and Cena winning sucked but it was alright|`|a6359c2d168d2b17db61d895f68b527caa	yea i have to agree unfortunatly that orton will beat him...i hate both of them and neither one can wrestle but ill hand it to cena/lashly as they put on a hell of a main event and by far the best match of the night|`|58a0547b180f824d46b4e6cf2f907dcaaa	They keep getting worse every month. This is what we are in store for with Stephanie in charge|`|IaLPd0Cpaa	it was obviously gay and im glad i didint order it...summerslam will be tite.....king booker vs. triple h is a for sure match and i think cena will lose the title|`|GriJJ8V5aa	it was horrible i think the highlight of the night is when hornswagle won and that pitifully|`|45rC5VPWaa	Reasonable PPV, not a great one.  The Hornswoggle angle made me giggle a bit.  It was to be expected for Cena to win the title.  Cant see Orton taking it from him at Summerslam though, WWE seem to be destroying Orton rather than giving him a big push.    Khali will keep the title until the return of The Undertaker too.|`|Nsjbvwoqaa	Yeah it sucked. Punk lost, Khali won, and Cena won.|`|piBue77Waa	i totally agree! PPV SUCKED! yeah..one title change. cruiserweight...to a midget (no offense but it would be kinda embarassing to jamie noble since hornswoggle pinned him..and hornswoggle isnt really a wrestler but more of a "manager")    and it is killing the wwe every time cena retains that title.    john cena is my favorite..i love him. but he has been champion too long.    randy orton will probably win it monday, or at summerslam. then hhh will feud with orton for the title. and john cena stuck in the middle.      it would be entertaining, and would really save the wwe.|`|GECOUyUZaa	the ppv sucked
uhcQ5YX3aa	lol lol i agree hes a preety cool kid but hes finisher is a joke lol!!!!!|`|0b8411d7b4b495e16a5fdcd51d42a348aa	Sounds like a little jealousy here,'eh?  Could your attitude have anything to do with the effect he has on women? Or perhaps part of you poor attitude has to do with "Maria"?  Punk is a nice guy with a lot of ambition.  Look at the positive,l and there is plenty.  His finishing move is as good as any. And he is doing it with 2 broken fingers. At least now kids have someone positive to look up to.|`|f6a54fe6f7ac11afebbdef637114de3faa	Yeah, it does kinda suck but his Anaconda Vice move was AWESOME!!|`|aa7952b98dee1fe421d09f4e27b2f058aa	He just needs some acting lessons.|`|mqHooIblaa	yeah|`|NPNtqV9laa	I guess so... the worst finisher to me is the fu ckin FU|`|AT8I8Tkraa	well if ur so smart the guy who made that move "kenta" got best wrstling finisher of the year by pwi|`|lE1yC5AAaa	ya i know how can u possibly go from a pepsi plunge to gay gts, i hate CM punk|`|Y8WuM6sbaa	John Cena sucks.........

If done for real, the GTS would possibly kill someone. In reality a lot of those wrestlers should be dead because of it. I understand wrestling is scripted but don't do something to make it look completely fake.|`|a6359c2d168d2b17db61d895f68b527caa	your the worst shitbrick.CM Punk more then likely had no say in what his finisher would be as Vince does all that ****.He should have stayed with ROH because there at least he wasnt overlooked and that company is what it is today because of CM Punk.So your dumbass needs to go to sleep

Steve Mcnair becomes back for his second season, he will be a little more famialr with the system. Jamal Lewis is still a hardnose tough RB. And the defense as always led by Ray Lewis will be great. Yes, the loss of Adilus Thomas will hurt, but still there is alot of talent on the defensive side of the ball.

Mais ces 2 records sont un peu tronqus:  la fin de la carrire (notamment sa dernire coupe du monde), il ne disputait que des bouts de matchs afin de battre ces fameux records.

Tu aurais peut tre prfr que les Blacks tombent au premier tour contre la France L'angleterre l'Australie et les samoa?? c'est s?r que les petits auraient eu leur chance, mais il faut avouer que Australie-Nouvelle Zlande en Finale c'est plus intressant que Gorgie-Portugal, non?    On voit que tu ne connais rien au rugby, et au sport en gnral...les tirages au sort se fait de la manire suivante: on met les quipes dans un chapeau, par niveau (ex: Nouvelle-Zlande, Australie, Afrique du Sud et France pour cette dition). C'est le chapeau 1.  Chapeau 2: Ecosse, Irlande, Angleterre et  Pays de Galles, et ainsi de suite jusqu'au chapeau 5.   Ensuite on tire au sort une quipe par chapeau, ce qui donne les poules; ainsi, Australie et Nouvelle Zlande ne peuvent se rencontrer au premier tour, ce qui est mieux pour l'intrt de la comptition...  Et ?a vite aux gros de se faire liminer par d'autres gros, alors que des quipes beaucoup plus faibles pourraient se qualifier sans problme. Et ?a vite aussi qu'une quipe comme le Portugal ne se retrouve qu'avec des quipes du Tri (ou Six) Nations; avoue quand mme que c'est mieux pour tout le monde.

I think you need to go to bed or sit in a corner and time out.  Face it, Barry Bonds is the Home run king until someone upseats him or someone can come up with clear evidence that he cheated.  Until that happens, like it, love it, hate it, who really cares.    Add On:   Some of you all are so pathetic that your whole lives revolves around Barry Bonds, Not one of you are getting paid for coverage on this and not one of you can prove that he did or didn't otherwise.  I'm sure this incident will eventually play out in the future one way or another. You all put your time and energy into Barry and his situation something you all can't fix other than other situations you all can.  When was the last time you gave a dollar to a homeless person on the street. Or gave to a food pantry, or clothing shelter?  Use this energy you have for baseball and records you will never achieve and put it someplace else.|`|afdfce66ad7b8f8fdc548e7aeac9f051aa	Barry Bonds took steroids and HGH, but legally.  If a doctor prescribes drugs, you take them legally, whether or not you're a sports figure or celebrity.    People don't idolize him.  Just respect him for using his skill in passing up the HR record.  How can he cheat when he took those drugs when not banned or made illegal?  The blame should fall on Bud Selig because he banned those drugs too late after Barry and others used them.    His name is Barry Bonds anyways.....  Not Barroids because it sounds like you're saying you see him suffer from hemorrhoids.....|`|0zaHXtUyaa	Have you ever thought of...oh I don't know...maybe because "He doesn't want to!!" Ever thought of that??    Answer this question. Why dont he just say he did take steroids?    Or answer this, why did you cheat at the game of monopoly you played last night?? I clearly passed "GO" and you never gave me my $200.|`|d0bcd4cf8ee0f661c18414379dc45000aa	Haha! Monopoly *tears* oh that made my day!|`|HZeHR09Eaa	i agree. it would make more sense|`|MwJlZZQgaa	He said in a press conference right after the game in which he hit 756* "This record is not tainted at all...at all period" And then said, "You guys can say whatever you want" Implying that he did not use steroids.|`|MgOorECbaa	Barry never took steroids... he took HGH. They dont test for HGH, so thats why hes never been proven guilty, because they are testing for the wrong thing. I mean, once u stop growing, your done. The year he hit 73 he grew an inch and 18 pounds. his hat size increased by 2 and a half. another year he put on 16 pounds.   he started his career at 6'1" and 185lbs, and he is currently 6'2" and like 237ish.  nah he didnt do ANYTHING|`|DkYipq1faa	you guys might have missed that three weeks straight of the bonds episode on espn, he did come out and say that along time ago.|`|QOVMm8J4aa	If he did in fact use, did he use them at a time that they were not illegal in baseball?  We as fans demanded the players use them and hit 600 footers, and throw 200mph and then got upset when we "found out" they were using?  Come on get real.  Just because you don't like him don't hate him.|`|Ww4Va6sqaa	Actually, I remember he said, at a press conference(not a recent one), that it was just hard work--nothing more.|`|AA10358665	You can't break rules that don't exist. Even *IF* it could be proven that he did take steroids (proof has not yet been offered) they were not a banned substance at the time. You can't blame Barry for using performance enhancing drugs any more than you could fault Cy Young for using the spit-ball.     At this point, there is only insinuation, and nothing SHOWING Bonds did anything other than work hard.     Other than Raffy Palmero, the players who have been caught have been border-line players who would be lucky to sign a long term contract, much less make break any records. Steroids (if they were used) didn't get Barry the record (after all, who knows which pitchers and which other hitters may also have been using?) Barry did.     Ignorant speculation means nothing.|`|AA11818994	Did Bonds turn you down for an autograph or something?

Si tu veux un club bourr d'Argentins (Hernandez, Ledesma, Roncero, Corleto, ) mais avec peu de grandes figures fran?aises (Dominici, Marconnet, Skrela, ), il y a le Stade Fran?ais, avec son nouveau maillot IMMONDE ^^ !!  Mais si tu veux un club avec quelques trs bons joueurs argentins (Hasan, Vernet Basualdo, Albacete ) et de grandes figures fran?aises (Heymans, Clerc, Poitrenaud, Jauzion, Ellisalde, Dusautoir, Nyanga ) et un des mythes mondiaux du rugby (Byron Kelleher), il y a le club le plus titr d'Europe, le STADE TOULOUSAIN !! (J'espre que ?a ce voit pas trop que c'est mon club prfr ^^ !!)    Perso, en toute objectivit, je te conseille plut?t le Stade Toulousain, car c'est une quipe qui a un vrai style de jeu !! Elle joue beaucoup  la main, fait de trs belles relances, aime le contact, les beaux cad'db' (ndlr : cadrages-dbordements), elle a un palmars long comme mon bras, un super entraineur (Guy Novs, bien que Galthier soit super aussi !!) et surtout un super public (comme ce fut le cas pour France-Naminie) !!    Voila pour le Top 14 !!    Pour la Pro D2, il y a bien s?r le Racing Mtro 92 o il y a tous les grands "anciens" comme Pichot, Auradoux, Dubois et pleins d'autres     Voili voilou, j'espre t'avoir aid pour faire ton choix sans t'influencer :D !!|`|2g6WGeXDaa	toulouse    pour le palmares  pour omar hasan l'argentin qui chante  l'opera de toulouse  parce que je suis toulousain|`|DriXk8ksaa	ben forcment, c'est pour toi le stade francais (l'quipe de paris)  un tiers des joueurs de l'quipe argentine y jouent !!!|`|68b727a907cd253c6288daaaa2cdac7faa	bon je m'y connais rien non plus mais es tu s?r d'etre bon pour vouloir intgrer une quipe dj performante ?  pourquoi ne pas dj t'inscrire dans le club de ta rgion !|`|1pdMn0xGaa	Idem, le Stade fran?ais, si vous tenez absolument  soutenir des argentins.

Tu peux commencer dans une quipe snior sans passer par une cole de rugby vu ton "grand age" (lol), simplement trouve une ville qui n'est pas en fdrale par exemple. De plus mme les clubs ont souvent (voire obligatoire) une quipe 1 et une quipe 2, voire 3  Mon homme a commenc relativement tard (20 ans), n'y connaissait rien avant, et maintenant joue en quipe 1 de fdrale 3,  25 ans.

Je ne parlerais que de son jeu, le reste je ne peux me prononcer, pas interresse. On lui a souvent reprocher son jeu au pied qui c'est ameliore surtout en comparaison a Skrela par exemple qui n'arrive pas trouver les touches non plus et qui du a sa lenteur se fait contrer.   Tout le monde anonce Bauxis mais franchement par rapport a Michalak, il ya pour l'instant une classe d'ecart, Bauxis n'est meme pas selectionne par le SF pour les phases finales, de plus osn match face au gallois a ete tres tres moyen, pour un 10 ayant un coup de pied enorme , il ne trouve pas les touches non plus.

Il aurait fait prendre une autre tournure au match.  Contre l'Irlande, vaut mieux un gars comme Skrela pour calmer le jeu, plus classique mais surtout capable de renvoyer les Irlandais  10 mtres.

En conclusion, je mettrai Titulaire Fred Michalak pour son gnie, et Beauxis pour tuer le match.|`|78f6a68e760f1110101c1cd9cfa5a7d5aa	Michalak|`|xqzQMjAEaa	ET Garcimore... c'est possible?|`|kowt7KpHaa	michalak est le plus inventif   il peut faire gagner un match|`|4e7197cdbe29fe67b02cd6a50d931507aa	Skrela pour etre le plus complet.

J'ai trouv Chabal excellent comme trs souvent, au contraire Marty semblait ailleurs(mais bon, il y a des jours avec et des jours sans). Par contre, bravo la Namibie, malgr la fatigue et le carton rouge ils n'ont pas abandonn et ?a jusqu' la fin,ce qui explique le bel essai marqu tout juste avant la fin du match.

whP8CZHraa	HPC signifie handicape  c'est le niveau de jeu  exemple: le mien est 49.5 ,sur un parcour 18 trou le par et de 72 coups(il varie selon le parcour). Quand je joue sur ce parcour je joue 72 coups+49.5 coups  calcule effectu par la federation de golf lors d'une competition de classement. Plus je score prs du par plus mon hpc descend(reve de tout golfeur)  les calculs sont tres complexes ils prennent en compte la difficulte du parcour, le niveau du joueur,la serie dans laquelle le joueur volue, ces performances lors de la compet'. Ils calculent le tout et te designent un nouveau hpc.  pas simple hein?|`|af56642e7dbc6e645c50b44bda5c6fa5aa	HCP =HANDICAP    Le handicap, qu'on crit Hep, donne au golf une originalit qu'on ne retrouve dans aucun autre sport. Car si le Hcp est d'abord un systme de classement des joueurs comme il en existe au tennis par exemple, le Hcp est aussi, lors d'une partie, un lment pris en compte pour le calcul du score final. Donc, le Hcp comme classement, fonctionne sur le principe suivant: tout joueur estim capable de jouer rgulirement ( ? Par excellence? est dot d'un Hcp de O. Le joueur dbutant re?oit lui un Hcp de + 36.     Cest assez complexe et je vous renvoie  la rglementation jointe    http://www.golf-pratique.com/page8.html|`|zhYx3FqXaa	le handicap permet au golfeur de tout niveau de se rencontrer  lors de la premire comptition il est attribu forfaitairemnt un hcp de 55  les competitions en stableford permettent de baisser (ou augmenter le hcp)  ex : un par 4 attribue 2points au joueur qui le joue dans le par  3 pt au birdie 4 a l eagle / et 1 point au bogey et 0 au dble bogey -  si je suis 36 de hcp ( le parcours peut me rendre suivant sa difficult 2 coups par trou) en rsumant le parcours  un seul trou : un par 4 devient pour moi un "par 6" -     si je joue 7 mon handicap va augmenter car j'aurai effectuer une contre performance  si je joue 5 mon hcp va baisser car j'aurai effecture une perf    voila  cela permet de jouer et de se classer parmi d'autre joueurs de niveau diffrent|`|1828c995d9e46a697678a6436e832a6faa	Le handicap maintenant correspond au niveau de jeu d'un joueur ramen  la difficult d'un parcours.  Avant le handicap tait le niveau de jeu d'un joueur et correspondait au nombre de coups qu'il jouait en dessus du par sur un parcours de 18 trous. Il dbutait  36.  Maintenant le classement a chang. On prend en compte la difficult d'un parcours.   Le classement s'appelle l'index et commence maintenant  53,5. Ceci est le classement normal.   Pour une comptition on va calculer son handicap de jeu en fonction du parcours jou. La difficult d'un parcours est estime  partir de 2 chiffres le "slope" et le "SSS"  Le slope est la difficult d'un parcours pour un joueur qui fait  peu prs bogey  chaque trou.   Le SSS est le score moyen d'un joueur scratch (ou avec un index 0)  La formule pour calculer le handicap est :   hcp = index *Slope /113 +(SSS- Par Total)    Sinon sur une carte de jeu tu peux trouver la mention hcp pour chaque trou numrot de 1  18.   C'est la difficult de chaque trou. 1 le plus difficile. 18 le plus facile.

ZqvqvHAtaa	Deffinitely snowboarding. There is alot of risk in skateboarding which automatically makes harder because fear and doubt is in your head cause you to fall or screw up. Plus if you want to get technicle on a skateboard that is on a whole new level then recreational snowboarding... Now if your talking about a long board thats a bit easier but watch out because they go way faster then the smaller more typical skate board. and surfing is hard to learn....very hard.... ultimately i would try some skateboarding first then get into snowboarding. the skateboarding really helps your balance and is more accessable, but dont get too crazy and go down a hill you cant recover from. (that sucks....)    oh and to the post above mine. it's deffinitely easier to controll your speed on a snow board then a skateboard. it's alot easier to go out of controll on a skateboard.|`|6xsQutPNaa	snowboarding...... :]]|`|dY61VnW2aa	i like snowboarding....  but i think skateboarding is easier...|`|a1f641599b6d33d2469e0c96ddb273deaa	I would say Snowboarding...|`|bNKp39PIaa	well it all depens on how you feel on which board ,, surfing is probably the hardest ,, i started off snowboarding first then when it came to summer i tried skateboarding , sno and skate boarding are similar ,, but very different at the same time , it's pretty hard to saay which is the easiest they're all hard at first , i guess skateboarding is the easiest cuz u can control the speed you want to go at soo yea,,

Score an average amount of points but really be unselfish with the ball, dish it off whenever u c some1 open for an inside shot. give it to a perimeter player so he can shoot the J.

DuFBbqFbaa	1.) stay tight - so many girls bail out of stunts.      2.) stretch - you need to be flexible to hit some of the recommended stunts.      3.) practice - start by pulling the stunts on the ground without bases, then trying to stand on something (like a chair or bench). The key is to get your technique first.      4.) trust - trust the bases and your own skills. IF you are shaking, it will show and make the stunt more difficult.      5.) assist - so many fliers think that the bases are just supposed to lift them up. BUT this is untrue. The flier play a part in the lift by pushing off of the bases shoulders, jumping off the ground, and staying tight in the air.      6.) work out - have enough muscles to stay tight, and absorb the falls|`|YgLyaFfcaa	be very careful..|`|wbsWrBLYaa	be super tight. practice on cans. stretch.  take flight classes|`|6fbb6d407880bd146b1c690b5f242dc9aa	Be light.

Most likley they'll be in the city spending most of their time. Jersey is boring as hell.     Go to the arena Eearly Way early, wait for them to arive, if your lucky you can get them to hold a convo with you. If that happens every time their in the area be it NJ or NYC keep going early.

C'est vraiment le moment de repartir avec un groupe nouveau et de remercier les joueurs de 1998 car ils ont normment apport  la France et  la slection.

Il me semble (je peux me tromper) que cette faute est + involontaire et consquence de maladresse, que rellement intentionnelle dans le but de nuire  l'attaquant. Mais bon, c'est le rglement, donc pas grand chose  dire (et puis Abidal tait tellement pas bon...).    2 erreurs d'arbitrage flagrantes qui, mme si elles ne sont pas importantes, montre le niveau du trio arbitral hier soir, et laisse planer un doute sur leur objectivit:  - main (involontaire) d'un italien devant la surface sur un centre de Clerc (normalement c'est coup franc pour les fran?ais).  - sortie de but siffle pour les italiens, alors qu'ils sont 3  se dchirer sur 30 mtres pour tenter d'viter le corner...no comment    Mais bon, on perd dfinitivement le match quand Domenech dcide de sortir Nasri, alors qu'on doit marquer 2 buts pour se qualifier.

D7OFstJzaa	Sans hsitation: Toulalan: 3 matchs pleins o il a fait son boulot, aucune erreur notable.  Beaucoup lui reprochent de ne pas jouer vers l'avant, mais est-ce qu'on reproche aux attaquants de ne pas dfendre??   Son jeu,  l'instar de makelele est de rcuprer les ballons; il ne joue pas comme Vieira, qui est capable d'attaquer.   Toulalan a parfaitement fait ce qu'il avait  faire; si on avait vraiment voulu remplacer Vieira, il fallait mettre Flamini, qui a le mme style que lui: puissant, rapide et capable d'attaquer.

1de8de08724f9de70d9b40740c046ef4aa	Honesty yes i think so, on a very minor level. 2 hand touch is a game for backs, as a forward what usable skill are you practicing durring two hand touch?  passing?  most of the time you take the ball to ground anyway.  basically as a bruiser forward, the only thing you'll take out of two hand touch is endurance, which is a good thing to have...i just don't count this as actual practice for a forward.   make sure to put some extra work in on the tackling dummies pre season, preferably with a coach around to keep telling you how to hit better...you did the right thing keeping with rugby and ball handling, i just happen to think your also right that you've somewhat de-programed yourself for actual contact, so just make sure you put extra work in to de-sissify the contact element in your game    Big D|`|7285c3ac994d466bf893a96acb24fd29aa	Just look at it as ball training.  These days ability to handle the ball is valued.  Nothing worse than having a prop in the line who can't catch and pass and constantly knocks on because he lacks basic ball skills.|`|ed561fad61b6d5b4cc9db29d9ed124c0aa	Only if you let it. One way to reinforce your defense and tackling skills, even while playing touch, is to be tough on yourself. Only call "touch" (assuming you're calling your own) if you KNOW you would have made the tackle. Always go two hands. Always go below the waste. Try to get one hand on either side of the body. Lower your body and bend those knees. Get your head behind. Do EVERYTHING you would do on a normal tackle except actually wrap and bring the other fellow down.    If you do this mentally, as the others have said, you will be a better player because of it. You're building evasion techniques, ball-handling, sense of spacing, etc. And fitness.    Best of luck on your coming season.|`|VHbeCyXhaa	It shouldn't be too much of a problem but if you're worried then try playing a slightly more contact oriented variation of touch where you have to actually stop your opponent moving without bringing him to the ground.|`|1YdL04Jcaa	no.  hell no.  as a prop who's played forever, anything that teaches you evasion is a good thing.  As you'll find out as you get older, you never forget how to hit someone and knowing more than one way to get around somebody is a huge advantage.|`|Ml6mMDlvaa	Do it!! I'm a hooker and I've been playing tag rugby during the summer with my team, even if it doesn't help you with evasion, it will keep you fit and you certainly won't lose your tackling ability.|`|zjGRfALRaa	No, it will just make you more fit to make the tackle. You'll be able to jump to tackles more and make tackles you might not have made before. But if you feel you won't be able to make contact then get a mate who's about you size and practice on him

kvXIzBqTaa	Small forward  The small forward also known as the "3", is typically somewhat shorter, quicker, and leaner than power forwards and centers, but on occasion are just as tall. The small forward position is considered to be perhaps the most versatile of the main five basketball positions, due to the nature of its role, which is sometimes similar to that of a power forward, and other times more resembles the role of a shooting guard.    Small forwards are primarily responsible for scoring points and also often as secondary or tertiary rebounders behind the power forwards and centers, although a few who play as point forwards have considerable passing responsibilities. Many small forwards in professional basketball, however, are prolific scorers. The styles with which small forwards amass their points vary widely, as some players at the position, like the New Orleans Hornets' Peja Stojakovic, are very accurate straight-up shooters, while others like Houston Rockets forward Ron Artest prefer to "bang inside" (initiate and/or not shy away from physical contact with opposing players), while others are primarily slashers, such as Carmelo Anthony of the Denver Nuggets. Another excellent small forward in the NBA right now is the Cleveland Cavaliers' LeBron James. He has a variety of weapons, such as a shooting ability, quickness, and strength inside. One common thread between all kinds of small forwards is an ability to "get to the line", that is how opposing players called for committing shooting fouls against them, as fouls are frequently called on the defense when offensive players "take the ball hard" to the basket, that is, aggressively attempt post-up plays, lay-ups, or slam dunks. Therefore, accurate foul shooting is an imperative skill for small forwards, many of whom record a large portion of their points from the foul line. Small Forwards should be able to do a little bit of everything on the court. For example, LeBron James averaged close to 30ppg, 8rpg, and 7apg.    Defense is often a major priority for small forwards, who are often counted on using their athleticism and size as defensive advantages. Many small forwards are excellent defensive players including Artest, who is generally regarded as one of the best defensive players in the league today.[citation needed] Shawn Marion of the Miami Heat (previously with the Phoenix Suns) and Tayshaun Prince of the Detroit Pistons are able to guard any position on the floor with their length and athleticism and are often called upon to do so. Bruce Bowen of the San Antonio Spurs, while not a star offensive player, is a masterful and tenacious defender, both on the perimeter and closer to the hoop. Former small forwards known for their defensive abilities include Scottie Pippen, one of the best one-on-one defenders in the NBA for most of his career.      Power forward  Also known as the "4" position and abbreviated to "PF". The Power forward plays a role similar to that of center in the "post" or "low blocks". He plays offensively with their back to the basket on offense and position themselves defensively under the basket in a zone defense or against the opposing power forward on defense in man-to-man defense.    |`|Kc6R1MUmaa	wow.

Allez demander aux grecs des JO antiques, il y a 25 sicles ils en auraient eu  raconter sur le sujet.  Quant aux JO modernes, ils ont redmarr sous les mmes auspices. Et les premires "grandes boucles" ont aussi donn lieu  des tentatives de la part des concurrents de se donner un avantage sur les autres par des moyens peu "sportifs".  Depuis, le "sport" pratiqu par une lite pour une immense majorit de (tl) spectateurs sous l'gide de partenaires fianciers pas du tout dsintresss a fait d'indniables progrs. Et la peste motionnelle nationaliste y fleurit toujours aussi bien: pour tout dire, elle en constitue le supplment d'ame.   "Notre" champion, "nos" joueurs, "notre" quipe, comme ils disent! Cela ne fait certes pas un Heysel tous les jours. Mais cela fait des millions - des milliards mme, peut-tre, lors des grand messes olympiques - de petits nationalistes qui retrempent leur fibre patriotique dans la sueur des athltes.     Il sera toujours loisible de faire rsonner cette fibre plus tard, dans d'autres circonstances. Pour faire diversion  coups de chasse aux immigrs, par exemple.      Bref, ne laissons plus personne jouer  notre place: jouons nos vies nous-mmes, faisons nous plaisir. Nous pouvons tre assez grands pour nous donner des rgles du jeu  notre guise et en changer  notre convenance. Il s'agit simplement de commencer par faire taire ceux qui nous infantilisent et nous vendent des crans  plasma pour mieux nous faire vibrer au rythme des comptitions sportives.

ov7BmlTcaa	ODP programs can really vary state to state, some bring in European professional coaches, such as Illinois or others use local club coaches.  I would look at the caliber of coaches and how Oregon has done in the past.  In general, even if you don't make the team, the training you would get in the goalkeeper academy will really help your game.      In most states, goalkeepers go through a completely different tryout process than the field players.  The initial tryout is more aimed at the fieldplayers, but you will get a lot of time in goal.  So it's important to stay alert and in good position.  All the goalkeepers who tryout are invited to the ODP goalkeeper academy where they are further evaluate your technique.      Since tryouts are this weekend, there is not a lot you can do in the next couple of days.  As long as you are well conditioned and have solid hands and positioning you should do fine.  If you don't make it this year, I would highly suggest over summer attending a goalkeeper specific camp.      In terms of numbers, typically 10-15 goalkeepers tryout with 3 making the final team and an additional 5 go into the player's pool in which they can be called to play for either their home state or another state in their region.      Good luck with tryouts!|`|AA11725144	yes!!!    i go to a tourney in IA every year and those littles freaks are goood    and tahts IA    they only good at corn|`|0rgr5CbVaa	I think if you want to be Professinonal you should go to a Europeen or South American Country
N8nNNKzyaa	You dont have to do anything else. The running 3 miles a day is great for you, and if you want you can tell your coach about your skill level before you begin, but you dont need to worry about it. Its only training, not any serious competition, so its made to make you better so dont worry about you not being so good at first. Hope that helps :)|`|PK0AzNghaa	It's great that your running that works your legs and heart now work on your arms go to the gym if you can if you can't do around 60 push ups a day then for a tight stomach do 100 sit ups you are probably thinking this is a bit much but it will help a lot. Tell me how it goes if you want i love getting responses. God Bless.|`|qGgzKGEPaa	Honestly, all that can help you swim better is ACTUALLY swimming. Your running regime is good, but it'll only help you gain endurance and strength. As far as swimming technique and speed goes, that improves if you actually train in the water. I think you're doing fine so far.    It's probably responsible of you to warn your coach :) good luck!|`|d44814f5d4f58b5f0ec09eb648b22e02aa	I have been swimming for 9 years and i often do spring training. No other sport/activity can prepare a person for swimming, it true can be a tough sport. The best thing to do is relax, go to practice, try your hardest. If you find that you truly can't keep up, tell your coach that your having a REALLY hard time and see if they can help any. Coaches can be great, sometimes there is a lane for people that have a hard time keeping up. It sounds like you will do fine though.|`|SEuZvWZHaa	in swimming its not how good you are it is how you improve your  time and how you do better in your specific stroke but i would keep running and do the training cause it sounds like its a good thing and you teach people what you know and they will do the same it can only get better.|`|lvxOVPojaa	I would warn your coach.   Running will help however there is nothing like actually swimming.  However don't be nervous I have changed teams lots of times and in fact I started swimming in 9th grade (im a sr. now) and it was hard to be so far behind but you do get better. Just do the best you can and it will all work out.     Side note: "Fast" is a relitive term.... The people where that I first swam with on a YMCA team were "Fast" however today I could beat them all and I am one of the slower swimmers on my team... However my team has some really talented swimmers most having top 16times in the nation.

AA10190562	era is HUGE for me..... the RP's are the guys i trust to bring my era down.... SP's tend to either inflate or deflate era's, but your RP's are there to do nothing but deflate it...... any wins they get are just a bonus.... the other thing i look for is consistency.... for example f-rod in la will guarantee you 40+ saves, hoffman will do the same, papelbon should.... make sure you're not stuck with question marks like gagne or lidge..... my usual drafting technique is to have 4-5 closers with 1-3 good sp's..... this guarantee's a low era/whip....|`|560bTFitaa	Maybe I'm odd, but I never look for wins with a pitcher, too unpredictable (especially for a reliever).  I look to grab 1 or 2 stud closers, and then a couple set up guys like Broxton.  Depending on whether there is an innings limit, f you get good relievers, they can lower your ERA.  Go for saves first, then good strike out and ERA middle relievers.  You'll get some vulture wins.|`|i0qqBmyHaa	You want to look at the team they are on and how dominant their stuff is. A closer on a good team will get 10+ more save opportunities than a closer on a bad team. Losses are usually a bad sign about how effective a closer is.|`|c0ed4539e3aa930e9e13fe5baa84ddacaa	The reason why ERA and strikeouts dont matter as much is because usually the relievers only see limited playing time.  Therefore, the strikeout and walks will both be normally low.  The ERA can be good or bad though.  If they dont allow many runs in the time they play then the ERA will be low.  However, if they allow a lot of runs in one inning and they dont pitch for a little while after, the ERA can be through the rough.    But the most important reliever stat in fantasy baseball is really the saves.  They also wont get many decisions, neither wins or losses, but they will still get some.  Saves are usually where most relievers earn their fantasy points|`|CFqSS0E8aa	saves and WL are of course huge but also look at era and whip. if there whip is above 1.20 for a rp that is terrible. era should also be low

1UmxLAAtaa	i think guys have the faster reaction time.  Every sport that is competed by both guys and girls, the guys sport is faster.  For example volleyball, girls( im sorry all girl volleyball players) dont hit the ball very hard, at least compared to guys.  I have watched both mens and womens volleyball.  It is no comparsion.  Girls volleyball is about long rallies and guys volleyball is about putting the ball away.  So for a girl to dig a ball it would be a lot easier than a guy trying to dig a ball.|`|2MVQeCqOaa	Well, I have heard that testosterone helps guys to react faster. It seems to me like guys are built more for physical stuff than girls. Not that I'm knocking on girls or anything, but that is how it is.     I am ready to be convinced though, so some of you girls (or guys) need to post plausible arguments for their side.    Since the answer to this question is not obvious, the difference must be very small. And so it doesn't seem overly important one way or the other.    Let us know when you find out anyways.|`|07ce5572ef0018214bb8690cf3d54796aa	its not dependent on sex but on age - younger people have better reaction time and the individual|`|WBf2V8vSaa	Tomboys. lol|`|629a47f8d31b004a60b55c6d779d70deaa	tomboys|`|VMJCzs0Haa	Girls do.  I did a project last year to test and see if boys or girls have faster reaction times, and the girls do.    That's why you see most girls scream and run when a ball is coming towards them and guys just stand there and get hit.  Tomboys on the other hand have an advantage cause they're girls, so they have fast reflexes, but they're not afraid of the ball.  I'm not trying to get at any gender here.  I'm just saying from experience.    And all this about girls not as physically capable as boys is a lie.  You see some guys just lay around and watch TV with their popcorn all day.  Some girls can beat guys in tackle football too, depending on who it is.    It mostly depends on the condition they're in.    Back to your main question, I think tomboys have better reflexes, if that was what you're trying to say.  If it's between girls and guys, it's girls.    But good reflexes doesn't mean you're good in sports.  It just means you respond faster.|`|CpLGIP9Paa	guys 4 sure. thats why you dont see women in professional sports|`|mdFFwT7Gaa	Depends on the context.    In driving, for instance, it's been measured that male reaction time tends to be quicker than female (assuming no alcohol involved and other factors).    However, in hearing the cry of a baby, a female reaction time tends to be quicker than a male's reaction time.    More in the link below. It's pretty dense stuff, but has some good data.|`|nwYFxv8Haa	Its different for each individual, but as a population, I would say boys.  Back in the early times, men were the hunters and women stayed at home and took care of the kids.  Since the men had to hunt and kill animals for their families to live, their hand-eye coordination had to become very sharp.  Over time this became a built in trait.  So I would say males have a faster reaction time, because its in their genes.  I'm not a sexist, but I heard this before and it has a lot of truth in it.|`|ssBt2EtIaa	I think girls!! You see some of the people above me said that the boys in the earlier times went out to hunt when the girls stayed home... well did you ever think that maybe they made the girls stay home because they were just to precious to lose!! LOL!! Oh and for a science fair project that I did me and my friend studied the reaction time for boys and girl goats and it turned out that the girls responded quicker!! Oh and another thing on the hunting thing did you know that lions the female is the one who goes out to hunt while the male stays with the kid!!! And that guy was right on the kid thing we do respond quicker to a kids cries!!  That is my opinion and I know that a bunch of guys will not agree with me!!

7raszKidaa	Cubs over Angels in six. Cubs have a better starting rotation and better offense 1-9. Imagine the Cubs lineup with a DH. The DH would be either Fontenot, Hoffpauir, or Reed Johnson, depending on rather he gets the start in center. Or the Cubs can make it even better by making Soriano the DH, and putting DeRosa or Reed Johnson in Left right. That makes both our offense and defense better, since Soriano is such a liablity on defense.     Even though Zambrano has struggled his last two starts after throwing a no-hitter, i have reason to believe he will be lights out in the postseason. He has been demoted to Game 2, which will strike a fire within him to perform well. His first outing after his no-hitter his grandmother had died, and he was probably really frustated as well as sad. And his last outing Koyie Hill was calling the game and the umpire was calling a really tight strike zone. He will pitch much better with Soto calling the game and with a consistent strike zone.    Dempster also has the capability of being lights out in the postseason, he has been our most consistent starter. i think because he was a closer for four years he learned how to better manage an inning as well as keep his composure. He will be very deadly in big game situations.     The X-factor is definitely Rich Harden. If he can pitch like he is capable, the cubs will coast to the World Series, and he can get plenty of rest. (He is one of the most dominant pitchers in the league when healthy. in 4 game stretch, with the Cubs, He had 26innings, three earned runs with 40Ks to ONLY 8BBs). And they will be well-rested and ready to take on any AL opponent.    |`|VVNX1P3jaa	Right now, it could be anybody at this point, but the team at least suspect not to be there is the Chicago Cubs. |`|ZyMv49qxaa	I know it will be the team that wins 4 out of 7, beyond that it's a cr*p shoot.

aSoK0grIaa	I always wonder about that!!!    I have no idea... surfers cut me off all the time, and I don't know why... I'm not a kook- never cut any of the surfers off, wait my turn in the lineup just like everyone else, and yet they cuss me out, cut me off, try to run me over on purpose when I'm paddling out...    on the other hand, many surfers I know don't hate spongers... in fact, they love them- it's just the surfers that get really aggro, that feel that only they can ride the waves... those are the ones who hate spongers.    I've actually noticed that the majority of surfers who are actually good (as in, they have a nice style, they are pro, they compete, they're sponsored) don't really hate spongers... it's the ones who are average to above average, trying to work their way up, or the ones who are really kooky, who feel the need to hate spongers because it gives them a feeling of self accomplishment thinking that they're better than someone out in the lineup. (when really, we can sponge better than the majority of the surfers out there could xD )    really, we're all just trying to ride the waves...  one of my brothers is a surfer, the other is a sponger... I'm a sponger, I have friends who are surfers and a bunch of friends who are spongers, who have siblings, parents, friends who surf. Yet we all greet eachother with a shakka out in the water and smiles on our faces- regardless of what we're riding.     In my opinion, there are two types of bodyboarders. The little kids on the costco moreys and little wham-o foam boards from walmart, who get out in the lineup, cut off the surfers and generally piss off both spongers and surfers...  and then there's the spongers who are into it... who sponge for their life... everyday, at their local break... 360s, banks, rolls, ars's, backflips, barrels, airs, who ride well, and love their sport, who respect the rules of the lineup and just want to ride the waves because they love it, and they love sponging, and want to take the sport to the next level...    ... I just with surfers could see the waves through a sponger's eyes for once... and that some of them could learn to see the difference between a person who sponges because they can't surf, and a person who sponges because they love it, and they choose to... and only cut off the kooky ones.    *EDIT- in response to Chris K  As a bodyboarder, I used to surf. I still can surf- in fact, I used to shortboard for my school team. Some of the guys I sponge with every day- they used to surf too, and they're just about as good as lots of the surfers out there. It's not fair to say that bodyboarders can't surf, because many of us can-- if I go out on a day when my local break's wedging up a bit, I sponge, but if it's lined up enough, then I'll surf- same with the rest of the spongers. saying bodyboarding isn't a sport is, no offense, ridiculous. Have you ever seen real bodyboarding... say, teahupoo, pipe? How can you say that's not a sport? As a bodyboarder, I don't think I'm better than any other surfers, in fact, surfing is difficult, and I do respect it... but bodyboarders have challenged breaks around the world where surfing them wasn't even thought to be possible, and for that, you have to give spongers at least a little credit.|`|wJufC06Qaa	I don't hate spongers, but you can see why surfers hate you from the way you stated your question. Being extremely arrogant/cocky at a sport that 2 year olds can become professional at.    I've also found that boogieboarders tend to snake a lot more, constantly paddling to the inside and hogging every wave. While you are able to take off deeper, surfers hate you because you have no appreciation for the skill and technique used for riding a surfboard. While it may sound egotistical for us, nothing sounds more frustrating than an ignorant booger saying "wE beTTER ThaN yOu sTAnd UPs".    Try riding a surfboard before you talk crap to a surfer. While we all can work on our respect values, all of your ego needs to be treated first.      Edit:  Paddle T, how is it not cocky saying you think you're better than us? Standing up on a surfboard is an amazing amount harder than boogie boarding; Why can't boogie boarders understand that!|`|f552cceb14cda35d759812b1fd201f55aa	Spongers aren't all the same, just as surfers aren't all the same: two facts often forgotten.     I don't hate spongers, but I do despise them a little bit, to be honest. I started boogie boarding (yeah, thats what its called) as a kid, and progressed to surfing when I started standing up on my boogie board. I think that there is not a ton of skill nor effort involved in it. Basically, bodyboarders are wimps, who need to grow a pair. Its not a sport, and shouldn't have its own organizations. I'm not going to be openly hostile to a sponger for them just being a sponger, that's just not cool at all, but I will if they do something stupid and/or dangerous (which they often do).    Make the move and learn to stand up on a board. I know, its hard, but you'll get it, eventually. Bodyboarding is something for kids, not full grown men who aren't athletic enough to stand on a surfboard. Come on, even longboarding is attainable to you people.    Also, I'm pretty sure you don't/can't get as much air. Maybe you get more air than some people, maybe people who just started surfing yesterday, but I challenge you to try and best me and many of the people I know any day with good waves.    Now there is something to be said for the ancient Hawaiians who first laid down on wood planks, but that was much different than the bodyboarding which has developed today. They at least progressed to surfing at some point in their lives, so I do give them thanks for the creation of surfing.     When I'm out surfing, I regard bodyboarders the same way I do Stand Up Paddlers: they're kooks and deserve no waves unless I know or see that they are very good at what they do. Very, very, very good.        *This will probably cause some aggravation, as the spongers know I am right yet cannot face the truth. These words weren't written in hate, but in sadness and candor. Stand up, my people, and learn to surf!|`|fbufRsgDaa	this is a response to the guy above 2 spots above-  That is not being cocky to say we can air higher than you, it would be an obvious reason for you to hate us. As a sponger, i do not get why you think you are better than us cause you can stand up. Like one of the other posts said there are two kinds of body boarders. you can't just lump the both of them into two categories. I never  cut surfers or spongers off for that matter, but i still get **** for being a sponger. If anyone is the kook, its the surfers who cut me off when the sets role in.|`|2c0444596932584b3d7b405860b90cadaa	Chris    What if I choose not to surf?  Perhaps someone like you can not imagine someone not wanting to surf but that can be the case.  You have an elitis attitude, and I would guess for no reason I doubt you are anything special.  But since you are making assumptions that we all want to surf, I am going to make and assumption that you are a racist, because anyone not like you whether body boarders and stand up paddlers all want to be like you (boy that makes me laugh), so I can only think you must be like that with everything in your life, you think people should be like you or they or beneath you.  You should be ashamed of yourself.  Maybe you need a hug or a good role model, I know some good people who sponge that you can look up to.  Maybe even some female ones so you can see what it is like to hug one.    |`|SiabvIZjaa	i think your way over reacting when you say that you can air higher than us. and you cut us off way more than a surfer would.|`|xhPKkkELaa	When I was a little boy, many, many years ago, I learned the ways of the ocean. I swam, I body surfed, and I 'body boarded'. Granted this was a good five years or more before Tom Morey invented the 'boogie board', and spongers came into being.    In 1966, I started surfing, it was something that you sort of 'grew up' into, after years of other water activities. I also learned to sail and snorkel and scuba dive.     There  have always been body boarders, the Hawaiians and polynesians bodyboarded. The Hawaiians called it a "paipo". In my day, a surfing genius, George Greenough, practically gave up stand up surfing for knee riding a hollowed out chunk of fiberglass.    Now, with that said, lots of spongers today tend to still be young adolescents, lots like it was fifty years ago. And, like it or not, lots of young adolescents are obnoxuious in the water. NOT ALL! I'm not that stupid to generalize. And, to some surfers, it seems as if adult spongers are suffering from some type of arrested development (still riding on their bellies, when they could be standing up). And some adult spongers still act like obnoxious adolescents, getting in surfers ways. I admit, there have been days when I have contemplated eviscerating a sponger or two who cut me off.     But, George Greenough realized forty years ago, that it sometimes is cooler to make radical manuevers in really critical parts of the wave, rather than just stand up and zig zag across the face of a wave. So, I guess overall, standing up, is not the most imporatnt part of riding waves.    Yes, some surfers hate spongers. But, if all surfers (and all spongers) treated everybody in the water with respect and if everybody realized that you don't have to get every wave, we would all be better off. I have been surfing for 42 years, and I surely don't hate body boarders. But I do tend to hate arrogant, rude, assholes, whether they are riding a Boogie Board or an Al Merrick Flyer.  We all 'kook out' every now and then, and do something stupid or inconsiderate. So we should apologize profusely, get out of the way, and try to learn from our mistakes. And real surfers don't hate anybody (at least not in the water). "nuf said.    |`|r1FX4xfMaa	personally, i dont have a problem with you guys. i actually think its pretty cool. but the reason is sometimes, some (a few, not all) bodyboarders like to drop in. one time at my beach there was this one bodyboarder that used to always drop in on surfers and get in their way. it made me mad. but after that some of the surfers at my beach got it in their heads that all bodyboarders are like that. i know that a lot of bodyboarers are cool so im cool with them and thats the only thing that i can think of to why we would hate bodyboarers|`|7LS6H4qDaa	I'm with you!

And the learning curve is shorter.  They'd want you to eventually put on about 25 lbs if you wanted to go to the NFL, but you could easily play at your current weight.    if you've got kind of a big rear end and thick thighs, you might have a good body type for Offensive line.  But you would have to put on about 60 lbs of bulk -- even if it goes mostly to the belly.    Your size would be beyond good for QB.

AA11547482	The WWE is wasting Shelton's talent.... that's what they're doing and I can see that the frustration is very visible.|`|AA11442722	I actually asked a question condeming Detroit for sending Shelton down to the minors while keeping a bunch of washed up vets up on the roster. Common mistake. A team panics. Youngster in a slump so they dump all over the youngster which does little to help his career and sends the wrong message to the rest of the team and especially those in the minors waiting to come up. When Shelton becomes a free agent the Tigers will really regret sending him down. They only regret it now I suspect.     Lets look at the move. Casey is a good hitter. He is also good with the glove, good enough I suspect he could play a fair 2nd base. If I were Tiger's management I'd seriously have considered Casey at 2nd.  Worse they kept Monroe and Thames while sending Shelton down. Shelton already had better stats than either of these guys are likely to have all year. Shelton has potential. Both Monroe and Thames are prospects that never panned out. Even with Casey at 1b they could have sent Monroe or Thames down and kept Shelton at DH. The Tigers are missing his bat big time right now and bringing him up now means he has to get used to MLB pitching all over again. It'll take some getting used to. So the Tigers sabataged thier offense with the move. Gained nothing.     They also wrecked morale and have hurt themselves for years to come with sending Shelton down. The next guys up from the minors are going to feel  like they cannot have an off week or they'll get sent down like Shelton. This will produce too much pressure and many will just burn out trying to be an instant superstar who never slumps. Shelton had good numbers when he was sent down. Better numbers than Casey did. Much better numbers than Thames or Monroe or Inge. What's this say to youngsters and team mates? One thing it says is the Tigers have no loyalty to it's players. That no matter who you are you can be sent down even if you are doing better than other players. If Monroe and or Thames are out of options, who cares? They are filler players. The kind you play until you find a rookie who can do the job. They are in thier prime right now and barely able to hit thier weight without any significant power. These are not players you build a team around. Niether are they even Tiger products. Both were given up on by another team and came to Detroit because the Tigers needed warm bodies at the time and they still had potential. Net loss if another team picks them up? Nothing. A rookie could do the same job but have the potential to be a much better player. A rookie could not do much worse.     In Toledo Josh Phelps, Ryan Raburn, Ryan Ludwick, Dustan Mohr and Tike Redman could play just as mediocre ball as Thames and Monroe. Of that group Phelps and Raburn are young enough to still do something. Raburn is still a good prospect. Even though he's a second baseman he could fill in in the OF and DH and hit better than Thames or Monroe I suspect. So if they lost one or both of them no big deal.     I am curious why the Tigers have croweded the prospects out of thier outfield with so many washed up ex-prospects like Mohr and Tikeman.  One of the Tiger's biggest holes is left field and DH. If Shelton moved to DH that would leave 3b, 2b and LF as the only offensive holes on the team.     I get frustrated when teams do things like this. This kind of mentality might keep Edgar Martinez out of the HOF.  Berkman rotted in the minors for two years while the Asto's played Monroe kind of nobodies.  Brian Giles rotted in the minors the same way.|`|4070ff47a63c6e1a14d222940884e427aa	nothing thats what|`|a2a522c226da9ac93cfcf696a2e46897aa	no shelton is the bad wrestler in all time|`|99486a44add5102c94e7c7fdece0ecb1aa	Yeah he's the bad wrestler in all time...

Agora, gosto  muito individual, eu por exemplo n?o acho gra?a no chamado "futebol americano", em beisebol, basquete, voley, jogos de baralho, etc.  Voc provavelmente deve ter um esporte ou jogo que voc acha "gra?a", isto n?o o faz inferior nem superior a ningum.   O legal do mundo  que cada grupo de pessoas gosta de coisas diferentes.

Acho que a adrenalina que se sente durante uma partida, principalmente se estiver no estdio torcendo compensa tudo.  Eu adoro futebol, tor?o muito, sou apaixonada pelo meu time, n?o s pelo time, pelos ttulos, mas pela histria do clube, pela garra que precisou ter dentro e fora de campo p/ estar onde est hj!!!  Acho que todos esses fatores influenciam p/ que uma pessoa goste de futebol!!

All that risers do is absorb some of the pressure off of your board from the trucks. For example if i ollie off something maybe 7 feet tall i might crack my board if i dont have risers. So really all they do is make sure your board doesnt break.

130b3ddc6e14a784399c30499c03e6cbaa	Some of the music from the WWE is very hard to find because the theme songs tend to be made by generally unknown bands (EG: Waterproof Blond, Mercy Drive, Metalingus). I've never heard of these bands before wrestling so they aren't commonly found.    try various MP3 sites if you must. The link will show you the proper names of wrestling themes and who made the music. But i suggest rather going to wwe.com and going to the online shop there. They sell theme song CDs at under $20 each and older ones even cheaper. This would save you a lot of effort because if you're looking for all the songs via MP3 sites it will take you months and months to find them. Plus the WWE CDs are official so you know you're getting the genuine deal.|`|AA11359854	Try out in Limewire. I got all the wwe songs there ..|`|3b837d8bcfa1f44770ff938d0ae68846aa	limewire.

cdf7d25a2ba0fa5148b49f53237c2320aa	Saludos amiga...    Yo creo que este juego ya dej de ser un juego mas y si es un clsico, no se necesita la aprobacin de nadie para decidir si es o no un clsico,     Un juego se denomina clsico cuando hay una gran rivalidad deportiva entre ambos, cuando es un juego de tradicin, cuendo casi siempre es un buen juego, cuando causa expectacin, cuando paraliza el corazn de varios, cuando paraliza a todo un pas, cuando todos hablan de eso, cuando es nico, cuando no se puede perder....    Para m es un clsico, pesele a quien le pese... no se necesita la aprobacin de nadie    Y si amiga, este es un juego que no distingue gneros... las mujeres son muy pasionales tambin para esto... y que mas se puede pedir si conoces a una linda chica que adems le vaya a los PUMAS....     Saludos y esperemos ganar el domingo  PUMAS no es solo un equipo, es un ESTILO DE VIDA|`|Hq4xt4LVaa	Yo primero preguntara ?qu es un clsico? para poder contestar correctamente. Las definiciones pueden variar. Para m un clsico es cuando hay algo ms que tres puntos en juego y provoca expectacin en seguidores de otros equipos no involucrados en ese partido, como yo, que no soy puma ni aguila. Para m s es un clsico, queda en debate si es ms, o menos, que contra chivas o cruz azul.|`|MDZXEGoOaa	A donde vaya la REBEL hay buen ambiente y mas cuando queremos humillar a las Gay-inas en la cancha aveces desepciona pero por lo general siempre los dejamos sangrando del asterisco en cancha y tribuna....

If people play on the same team for a while and get to know the other's peoples style also, the game can flow seamlessly. Each player has to know their role in the game and even if you have one player who is much better player, they still need to be able to work well as a team.     Another reason it's better is because it's faster and there's more happening - there are so many passes and intercepts and it can go from one end of the court to another so quickly. It's a great game to watch.     I hope this helps.

b3d5e01b61690541f093b9b7eaaacaf8aa	MASN is serving the Orioles and the Nationals very well. Pretty much no matter where you are in Maryland, Washington DC, Virginia, you can watch either the Orioles or the Nationals. (I'm also assuming south central PA, and parts of Delaware also get MASN).    Everyone in this region is happy this way. If you are in DC, but you support the O's, you don't have to worry about their games being blacked out. If you are a Nats fans, you know you can go pretty much anywhere within the region and you can find their game on TV.    And I love the classic games, at least for the Orioles. Who doesn't love reruns of their team winning the world series? Or watching a star player/hall of fame player in a game that they shined in? Those are the types of classic games that MASN shows for the Orioles.     MASN does also show classic games for the Nationals, however since the franchise has only been in DC for a couple of years, most of those are games where the Nationals have had a dramatic win.|`|065b430f4b4b9a58a8c14fa3b764d8c1aa	Ted Rogers owns Rogers Communications, which owns Rogers Cable, Rogers Home Phone, Rogers Internet, Rogers Video, as well as being both a cell phone and an Internet service provider, the owner of a number of TV stations in Canada, including 4 all-sports station (the Blue Jays flagship TV stations), the owner of a number of radio stations across the country, including the flagship station of the Blue Jays, the Raptors and the CFL Argonauts, the owner of the Rogers Centre in Toronto and of the Toronto Blue Jays.

Then all the daft analysts will change their tune and look like the dumb*sses they always turn out to br.|`|1e849f7c2921d244c992601647cce11eaa	No. Raiders need to work on alot of other holes to be good.|`|5d7f439011a6cbed3f40abae190694d3aa	I dont think anyone can do good with the raiders right now.  (they dont want to play)  They have no heart.   They are loaded with Talent who dont care.|`|KjNu0XD4aa	well thats the plan|`|72fc6db1aa9e5f36ab4595e0da420ee5aa	Russell should do very well with the Raiders for the six or seven years he is under contract.  He can make all the throws, he has an exceptionally strong arm, and Al Davis likes big strong QB's.  He needs some help with his footwork, but the QB coach can work with him on that.|`|AA11810119	the team is hopeless get used to it.... I really do not think anybody is gonna change that..... but you know ,who knows? Something might happen you really never know like when my team won the Super Bowl I thought they would lose because, of the weather but no, they won.|`|2ee5f1da7a972ec85a1bb0a20b4307d8aa	No.. but I don't think they'll draft him anyway.|`|CLYZaF2Jaa	If the Raiders O-Line keeps on letting there QB get sacked, then Russel with be useless.    In college, he may seem fast, but he won't be able to outrun the DE like Freeny, or Peppers or any line backers like in college. In the Pro, everyone is fast, so if the Raiders wanna win, they have to improve on there O-Line.    Weak O-Line + J. Russel = Horrible Season|`|IX4HNG5Naa	no one will do good with the raiders until al davis retires!|`|9KZ4SnY8aa	Yes. The Raiders have signed a pro bowl center, moved Robert Gallery and Barry Sims back to their natural positions, the positions they were great at back in college. I'm praying that they'll draft Justin Blalock in the second round, thus solving the line problem.    By the way, sure, Al Davis likes Calvin Johnson, but did he compare him to John Elway? No. But Al Davis did compare JaMarcus Russell to John Elway along with an interesting story about how John Elway should have been a Raider.    JaMarcus Russell + Dominick Rhodes + Randy Moss + New O-Line+ Number 3 Defense In The League = Good Seasons To Come.

Each slot has parameters as to how much a player can be signed for.  That is why Matt Leinart lost so much money when he drfited down the board on draft day.  Of course, an undrafted player could sign for any amount, but what team would do that?|`|AA11348030	It depends on the team. Each team has to fit their salaries under the salary cap. So the previous answer is partially correct. They could pay as much as they want, provided they can fit that dollar amount under the salary cap.
af8a53d818d9eccc44276375b03f40c0aa	Do you mean what happene on ecw? If so here are the results    ECW on SciFi opened with a video recap of last week's visit by Vince McMahon, his disrespect of the ECW Originals, and their beatdown of Elijah Burke. They showed old Sabu clips from the original ECW as he hit a Arabian Facebuster off the top rope on Burke through a chair.     Live in the ring, Sabu, Tommy Dreamer, Rob Van Dam, Balls Mahoney (wearing a neck brace courtesy of his Raw match against Umaga), and the Sandman were in the ring. Joey Styles said they were instructed to come to the ring by Vince McMahon. McMahon's music played and he made his way to the ring.     McMahon got into the ring with them, showing no fear. McMahon called them a bunch of has-beens and derelicts, then corrected himself and said they were a bunch of "never has-beens". He said that most of them have criminal records and they couldn't fit in with any other wrestling organization, so they were left with being ECW originals. McMahon said that anything about the original ECW suck so all of them suck. I can't believe there are six ECW wrestlers in the ring and all of them are standing there like idiots. I mean, seriously, does anyone on WWE creative get anything about any of their characters? I mean, it's not like the lead writer for the show used to, you know, attend ECW shows, or anything.     McMahon said they are all dinosaurs and dinosaurs all become extinct. McMahon said that could happen tonight because tonight a new breed will be unleashed. Sandman began brandishing his Singapore Cane, so McMahon reminded them all that they get a paycheck from him and he is the boss. He says that some of them will be in action tonight and warned them not to lay their hands on any of the appointed officials (special heel referee alert!) and not to interfere in anyone else's matches. He warned them that if they did, they'll be fired. The independent wrestling scene should be so lucky.     Joey and Tazz plugged ECW World champion Bobby Lashley vs. Hardcore Holly later tonight.     We returned from a commercial for a video feature on the revamped, bald Snitsky, complete with a spooky voice saying his name. I wouldn't be surprised if some fans watching it thought it may have been a Kane video until the end.     Kevin Thorn (with Ariel) vs. Tommy Dreamer     So, the storyline is old ECW guys vs. new ECW guys and none of the ECW Originals can help each other. Matt Striker was the special guest referee. Striker warned Thorn not to use a closed fist early after Thorn pummeled Dreamer in the corner. Dreamer was choked against the ropes. Dreamer tried to comeback but was cut off with a jawbreaker. Thorn began fish hooking Dreamer's face. Dreamer came back with a sitdown jawbreaker of his own. Dreamer hit a series of rights, following up with a neckbreaker.     Dreamer charged Thorn in the corner but met an elbow. Dreamer hit a sitdown tiger driver for a potential pinfall, but Striker began acting like he was hurt. Thorn clotheslined Dreamer, knocking him over Striker (who was on his hands and knees) and covered him. Striker made the cover.     Your winner, Kevin Thorn.     What a lame finish to a lame match. Until WWE "gets" Dreamer's character as the everyday guy who fights the good fight and loses, but never gives up despite the odds (Think Rocky Balboa or John McClane in "Die Hard"), he's nothing but a shiftless enhancement guy, so Thorn gets nothing out of defeating him. Sometimes, you really have to wonder why WWE wouldn't want to maximize all of their performers in order to maximize their worth to the overall company.     Dreamer got up and looked at Striker but Joey and Tazz reminded us that he wasn't allowed to touch the officials. I can't wait for Jonathan Coachman to show up later and screw Sabu myself.     Rebecca interviewed Hardcore Holly. Holly said Lashley has been defending the ECW World championship against everyone but him and tonight he's going to prove why he deserves to be the ECW champion. Short but decent promo. I'm way in the minority here but I like Holly's work a lot.     They aired a Bobby Lashley feature, interviewing his mother, showing Lashley visiting his hometown, footage from his college wrestling career, and his Army career. Joey Styles noted it was the first of a four part series on Lashley. It was short but a big step in the right direction. Fans need a reason to care about Lashley, especially in the position he's been booked into. That was a step in right direction.     ECW World champion Bobby Lashley vs. Hardcore Holly     They noted Lashley defended against Kenny Dykstra on Raw last night. Holly and Lashley locked up early. Lashley backed up Holly in the corner but Holly refused to back down. They were really physical for a moment. Lashley took down Holly with a big shoulderblock. Lashley hit a delayed vertical suplex on Holly. They were pushing Lashley's athletic background bigtime on the commentary. Holly nailed Lashley with a Hot Shot across the ropes. Holly sent Lashley into the ringpost shoulder-first. Lashley was then tossed to the floor.     Holly followed Lashley to the floor and slammed him backwards into the ringpost. Holly threw Lashley into the ring steps, then returned to the ring. The storyline was Holly was trying to injure Lashley's shoulder in order to weaken him. Holly went right after Lashley again, focusing on his lower back, then locked on an extreme chinlock. Lashley fought back to his feet but Holly nailed him and took him back down with a forearm in the face as Lashley rebounded off the ropes. Holly covered the champion for a one count. Holly went right back after the lower back.     Lashley fought back. He charged Holly in the corner, but missed. Holly began dropping elbows across Lashley's exposed back. He grapevined Lashley's legs and pulled back. Holly applied a|`|63c0ae0160be83f8dda5f3b0e669f342aa	Do u mean on?  Vince came out and insulted the originals and said some of them would have a match. The extremists were not allowed to interefere and the guys fighting couldn't attack any special guys like the ref or timekeeper or anythin while the match was goin on or they'd be fired.  Kevin Thorn def. Tommy Dreamer  Matt Striker was the special ref. Dreamer had the pin and victory but Striker "injured" his leg and couldn't pin and then Thorn attacked and pinned for the victory  Lashley def. Hardcore Holly  After the match Snitsky attacked Lashley  Marcus Cor Von def. balls Mahoney  Mahoney was injured from his match against Umaga and thios was easy for Cor von. Striker was special timekeeper.  Elijiah Burke def. RVD  Special commentor: Cor Von  Special ring announcer: Matt Striker  Special timekeeper: Kevin Thorn  RVd was about to win w/ the Five Star frog splash but Thorn rang the bell causing RVD to get distracted. Then Burke did a low blow and won.  Then Thorn Burke Striker and Cor Von attacked RVd but since the matches were over Sabu Dreamer and Sandman attacked the bad guys|`|a2a522c226da9ac93cfcf696a2e46897aa	its a bad show suck for ECW|`|8jhEMWV9aa	ECW never got any advertising outside their own shows has Paul Heyman and the network he was on never liked each other, because of this, they never attracted new fans and never got anybody attached to their shows. They could never in that, make it anywhere and so, they died out. WWE and Mcmahon than saw oppertunity and so, crushed ECW and soon after, they bought it. This is why they are allowed to use ECW footage, the name and references.|`|d107d3f1cce6252b503d9c559b243ed6aa	It died in 2001|`|AA12056929	"Does anyone realize we're watching the New Blood vs. the Millionaires Club from WCW?"    Yeah, Matt, that's exactly what I was saying when I read the review on ECW.com    As far as what happened to E-C-Dub, I think that Vince said "Wait, they're extreme, in-your-face antics cost me business, even during Attitude!" So he reached as far as he could up his **** and pulled out the biggest load he could find and slapped a rivals name on it. I don't even want to know what he'll do to TNA if he buys them out!    That, and its an onscreen developmental brand, like DSW/OVW, allowing him to train newcomers at ECW's expense.|`|768e39a0dfb49cf47199bdc4a79ab844aa	ecw is basically not as good anymore. wwe put more of there crap with storylines in there which makes it suck.|`|18fhlTo9aa	ECW used to enjoy the prestige of being the only indy fed to ever threaten the monopoly of Vincent K. Mcmahon.  It was a small fed started by 8 guys in Philly.  Those same eight guys that got in the ring were also the ones that mailed your tickets, picked up the merchendise and sold it during breaks, assembled the ring, and let people in the doors.  They were a balls out, smash mouth organization that did what they did because they had the passion that it takes to be in the business.  They attracted people who had been running the indy scene for years, such as Raven, because of there commitment to the fans and their ability to let the wrestlers be who they were.  Then came Mcmahon.  He asked to buy the company, and when he was refused he took it over anyway....yay for money I guess.  Then, after annihilating the ecw talent and making them RETARDED for the most part (again referencing Raven) Vince decided that he would try to attract the former ECW fan base by bringing back the organization.  However, now it is ECW ran by the WWE...which means that he is using it as a staging for the talent that he knows people want to see but that he doesn't want on his broadcast.  Hence why they only get a one hour show, are forbidden from doing the same kind of matches they were once famous, and are on the Sci Fi channel.     Come on...there is nothing left of the once great ECW, and that is a true travesty to the wrestling world.  I hope that one day there is another independent federation that has the gusto to challenge the big man....and show him that its the little people with the heart, no the big people with the contracts, that make wrestling worth it in the world.

It would also put Morrison and The Miz on to Wrestlemania since they lost their shot at getting into the Money In the Bank this year.

Cougars are roughly the same weight as an average man, remember.<br>  <br>  Neither of these animals are known to be particularly aggressive to humans (I assume you're talking black bears?) Hikers sometimes tell stories about being stalked by cougars, but it's quite possible the animal is simply curious since attacks on humans are very rare. Black bears can usually be scared away with loud noise, and are rarely aggressive unless they feel their cub is threatened.|`|AA11148143	I would feel pretty safe with that.

cR7Sf4cjaa	I am a long time Alaskan hunter and trapper.<br>  <br>  Both my ex and I have taken deer in Alaska with the 223/5.56mm - we've taken over 7 with it.  All have been one shot kills.<br>  <br>  First - find out the twist rate of your barrel.  Many 223 Rem barrels are slow twist rates for throwing varmint bullets.  If you have a 1:10, 1:12 or slower than stick with a soft nose 55 grain bullet and never, ever, use a full metal jacket on deer.<br>  <br>  If the rifle is a 1:9 or faster - there are some totally awesome 22 projectiles in the 60 to 75 grain area that hit much harder and fly better than the standard 55 grain bullet.  But - you need to handload to use them - I have not seen these loaded in factory ammo on the shelf - although I hear Hornady is going to start doing this.<br>  <br>  The 223 with 55 grain soft point if fine from 50 yards to 250 yards.  After that the laws of physics kick in and bullets begins to loose the power to pierce the hide, fat, muscle and break bone or hit vital organs on a quartering shot.  For 250 yard or greater you must have a nice broad side shot into the heart area.<br>  <br>  If your rifle will stabilize some of the heavier projectiles - now you can move out to 300 to 400 yards - if there is no wind.  But that is about it unless you spend 6 hours a day for 7 + days at the range really perfecting your long range shooting talents.  Once the wind picks up - all bets are off!!!  - you must have allot of long distance experience to hit anything past 300 yards accuratly enough to assue a one shot kill.<br>  <br>  One of the beauties of using the 223/5.56mm for deer is you can also take varmints - fox, coyote and wolf - especially animals that will prey on deer populations.  Too many hunters use a rifle that is 5x to 10x too powerful for deer and cannot take these cannines.  You can.<br>  <br>  I prefer the ballistic tip bullets for deer - for my first shot, and I try to get the deer broadside.  You get one hell of a whallop and the energy is used on the deer - not lost in a bullet that exits the other side.  You second and third round in the well needs to be a soft nose lead bullet as these will not ruin any meat if you have to shoot into a hind quarter and get into the vital organs on a deer that did not go down on the first shot and if moving away from you.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|VariKEFBaa	The generalized rule for deer (given small caliber) is atleast 2000 fps and 1000 ft/lbs of energy.  Look at a ballistics table and see how far out the .223 has 1000 or move ft/lbs.  <br>  <br>  Use the right bullet, varmint bullets are a poor choice, even for a head or neck shot, especially with such a small caliber.  <br>  <br>  Bottom line: I wouldnt take any shot over 100 yards if i didnt want to pointlessly injure the animal or be tracking it all over hell's creation for god knows how many miles.|`|VLXFPMOqaa	the problem with head shots is that they are always moving. aswell the deers brain is not the full size of the head so even though your shot connects into its head deer goes OWW SH*% what was that and runs off. then your left there trying to track wishing you left your self with a higher margin of error.<br>  <br>  shooting pop bottles is much diffrent than shooting deer ,are you shooting offhand at the 400 yard range or off the  bench ?|`|AA11289359	I have shot deer at a dead run 250 yards out with a 22-250 with a 55 gr bthp.<br>  I have two 22-6mm customs with 26 & 27" barrels, both will drop a deer in its tracks.<br>  Yes these guns are faster but a 22cal is a deadly bullet with its speed.<br>  The term used is hydra shock.|`|LMwDsjGAaa	If you want to take out deer at that distance I would step up to a .243 or even a 30-06.|`|2gWJjIEfaa	Well you can kill a deer with a .223 but it's risky. That round is just alittle to small for deer-sized game. If you buy a quality .223 round in a hollow point you should be alright, and if you aren't a trophy hunter then just shoot them in the head. Hunters always go for the vitals but a head shot works just as well. I have a friend that named Wally Turner, he use to be on quaker boy's pro staff, he said that he always shoots deer in the head and he never has to track them.|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	There are many opinions on this. If it is legal in your state/country then as far as I am concerned: <br>  <br>  Hunt only with bullets designed for 100lb+ animals such as the Trophy Bonded Bear Claw, Barnes X and Nosler Partition. If you can deliver around 1,000 ft-lbs of energy to the animal at the distance of the shot(I think most of the time this means about 100yds with a .223) you should get a nice clean kill. Of course you must be very picky about shots you take. Even those tough bullet designs can't reliably blow through the heaviest shoulder bones on large deer, let alone make a raking shot from the rear of the ribcage or front of the abdomen all the way into the vitals. If you are in an area with smaller deer it's not a bad choice but with large northern deer or areas where you often have to shoot at longer ranges it's not a good choice.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rifleshootermag.com/ammunition/centerfire_22_biggame/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rifleshootermag.com/ammunitio...</a>|`|biPiIIeMaa	I am edgy about the .223 against game that size without just wounding it, but the bullet is accurate enough that a good shot right through a lethal target (such as the brain) should do it in, but as they say in the military, you should aim for the center of mass, which on a deer is about where its heart is. For deer, I'd say get a Remington 700 SPS, which is reasonably cheap for such a great rifle (around $600-$700), and it comes in a ton of different chamberings from .223 to at least 300 Magnum, which is what mine shoots- and that WILL drop a deer. In fact, I know someone who has killed a moose outright with one of those.<br>  <br>  It is definitely possible to kill a deer at that range, but I can't guarantee that anything less than a perfect shot will kill it outright.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	If you're stuck with using a .223 for deer, wait until it gets within 100 yards or so.  And use the heaviest expanding bullets you can find,  Better yet, get at least a .243, or a .264 or bigger.|`|QrjuueMCaa	If that is all you have, and it is legal, good luck to you.<br>  <br>  Personally, I would want something a bit bigger. Yeah, I'm the guy that shoots deer with a .45 +p at under 20 yards, but anything is possible I guess.<br>  <br>  Do your homework, legally and physically if you are going to do that. Learn what limitations you have with your specific weapon. Do the best you can to make the most ethical kill possible.<br>  <br>  Lock and load. Keep your powder dry.|`|92jr44kFaa	I have the same rifle in 22-250 for varmint.  Good rifle, in my opinion.  Like everyone else said, the .223 is pretty light for deer.  I'd agree with heavy ammo, and within 100 yards.  If you can get off a good heart/lung shot with the .223, it'll be enough.  Of course, that's what you should be aiming for with any round.<br>  <br>  It's do-able, but be picky about your shot placement.  VERY picky.  Might want to think about a bigger cartridge.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Winchester does recommend it for Whitetail Deer, Black Bear, Antelope, and Mule Deer using the 64 grain Power-Point Bullet Only.* Maximum effective Range on these size animals with the 223 is 200 Yards Maximum.*.. Your State may not allow you to Hunt with this Caliber, be sure to check before using it.* Some States allow it and others do not.* Always aim and shoot the animals in the Heart & Lung area. No head or neck shots.* It also is excellent for varmints like Groundhogs, Coyote, or Fox.*|`|YrxLbfiIaa	The .223 cartridge is to light to ethically take deer...... I have seen folks comment here that the .223 is big enough but most will not agree.... The Minimum size cartridge is a .243 and even then my opinion is that cartridge it a little on the light weight side for deer....<br>  <br>  Stick with a .270 or a 30/30 for deer.....<br>  <br>  I do like the .223 for coyote, woodchucks and other smaller critters as well as target shooting.... But not for deer....<br>  <br>  If I am not mistaken it is illegal in many states to use a cartridge as small as a .223........<br>  <br>  The idea is to use a cartridge that will drop the deer quickly.... Some argue that a well placed shot will do the job but in reality if the shot isn't well placed you have an injured deer that may run off far enough where you wont be able to track it..... This isn't humane --|`|km9cQNAXaa	Congratulations on your choice. Out of the box you have one of the most accurate rifles made.<br>  <br>  In .223 it's a superb vermin weapon but for deer its getting marginal. I would limit shots to 200 yards and then use the heaviest bullet you can get. If you're unsure that the bullet placement will not be good then I say don't do it, nobody wants injured game.<br>  <br>  Check the game laws in the area you intend to shoot. Some areas will not allow a .223 for game hunting.<br>  <br>  Never understood this when the military sends the boys into combat with the same calibre !!!<br>    <br>  Ian M

Si vuelven a ver el gol de maradona, estarn de acuerdo en que los ingleses no hicieron gran esfuerzo para quitarle la pelota a diego. Ahora, que los que piensan que fu mejor el de maradona porque fue contra los ingleses, es pensar que los ingleses eran superiores a nosotros y que han sido siempre superior a nosotros.

Si tomamos en cuenta el contexto en que fue convertido y la calidad del rival, no quedan dudas que el gol de Maradona contra Inglaterra en una Copa del Mundo no puede ser comparado con la anotacin que le hizo Messi al Gestafe en un partido local.  Si sacamos el contexto y la calidad de rival, debo decir que Messi ensuci bastante la definicin, hizo una gambeta muy larga y pate desde casi la lnea de fondo, en cambio Diego descoloc a Shilton con un suave, casi imperceptible, movimiento de cadera y defini con el arco vaco.

Yr0mHSF3aa	Fact? I'd love to see the science behind your reasoning. Football or as Americans call it, soccer, is a sport that is an actual workout, an actual team sport, a real display of athleticism. <br>  <br>  Time outs? Please! Do your super basketball athletes need breaks to talk about tactics? In footy, the tactics are changed on the spot by a loud coach and a smart captain. Do you think your basketball players can run for 45 minutes straight? Don't get me started on games that last 120 minutes. Please, basketball better than soccer, that mentality only holds in the US.|`|c4GykfVkaa	Come on, just watch both and you'll see taht 2 billion people around the world aren't wrong!|`|6VZsiHJeaa	Yeah, I agree. It's much more exciting and intense.<br>  <br>  I like both, but I think basketball is better. Soccer is so boring to watch. They just kick the ball around the field the whole time, here there here there, and nothing ever really happens until they make a goal. And they hardly make any. It's still fun to play, though, but not as fun as basketball.|`|Vjan4Vq2aa	I'll state a fact: Soccer is more popular. Think about it. Maybe half of the 300 million Americans like Basketball. Pretty much the 731 million Europeans, 382 million South Americans, and 922 million Africans like soccer. You do the math.<br>  I'll state another fact: Ever notice how these two sports are similar. Since soccer was invented first, then basketball most likely used the principles of soccer when it was first introduced.|`|VVCpJFxtaa	It's not a fact. It is your (and mine) opinion. Please learn the difference between the two. The fact is far more people in the world enjoy watching and playing soccer than basketball. I know, I don't get it either but, whatever. To each their own.<br>  <br>  BTW Football(American) is better than basketball and soccer. My opinion not, a fact.|`|jSkHquK5aa	I like both basketball and soccer.|`|IWM1khX7aa	NO!|`|yapBvxWfaa	Nooo of course. Soccer is the most popular and the most interesting game in the world. All sport channels broadcasting soccer more than basketball. Most of sport news starts with soccer. Because people loves soccer more. And probably you know who is Maradona Pele Ronaldo Zidane Messi Ronaldinho Beckham. And probably any basketball fan know them. But actually i dont think that any soccer fan knows as much as basketball players. Basketball is popular in USA or in Canada. But soccer is the best game in the world|`|ePI3z0SBaa	yes. hate soccer its boring you wait for the ball to come to you so you can kick it to the other team and run the other way|`|SQn6v57Paa	To me, Basketball is more fun.

28758ed30da7e059122a7de03ffc2566aa	No. Romo had one good game and Bush is not very good. You could try to pick up Jay Cutler or Steven McNair who are decent QB's.|`|3f67bc27138586baa07f230b707ab971aa	Bush is only good if you're in a keeper league.........and if it is a keeper league, then definetly make the trade.    If not, pick up Jay Cutler.  He was just announced as the starting QB for the Broncos for the rest of the season.  Take a gamble with that instead.|`|47c25c3087a0ef90a4961daee709b07eaa	Dont make the trade. There is no evidence to prove that Romo is any good, wait till he has to play a good team and see what happens.Reggie Bush ech, another one that could go either way.   Ah yes friends are wonderful arent they.  Alexander is a normaly solid player you should keep him.|`|afc42810bdc979b4a7c9b7585fd1d78caa	definatly make the trade ... even though alexander did great tonight he had a lucky game ... look who they played ... the packers are a joke ... ROMO IS GREAT and reggie bush is pretty good as well ... the cowboys are at the top of their game here lately ... the seahawks arent ... take the trade and say thxxx|`|AA11380933	He is not your friend. Don't make the trade - don't believe the hype. Romo is a fluke and will come down to earth next game. Try trading for a more reliable QB i.e. Brady, Carson Palmer... There is a reason you drafted Alexander  2 (or so) it wasn't to trade him for a QB with approx. 5 games started in his NFL career. QBs are a dime a dozen, marquee RBs are not. If need be, play the matchups each week pick up and drop QBs on weekly basis. You should be able to find an adequate starter each week and Alexander will easily make up for the loss of acquiring Romo (if any). Believe me now and ask me later.|`|b7244920b30a170dfc1884d5d0887fe0aa	You didn't say who your other RBs were.  If you are deep at RB, then make the trade for the hot QB.  Remember, Alexander still has a gimpy foot, so his future production could be limited.|`|8585a79133ee5e3925f1f83082e87bccaa	If I needed a QB i would trade but the only bad part of that trade is bush I`d try to trade him to some other team and see who you could get for him

AA10498287	look at that... 3 girls told you to take out the legs.... nice|`|9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Do what your coach will advise....shoot for the waist! First of all if he is stronger than you the legs are the most powerful part of the body so unless you catch him with his feet close together then he will easily kick free from you. Plus if you aim at the waist you are aiming at the one part of the body that cant shift easily(you can get deked very easy with a leg or shoulder shift). It is easiest to wrap up a player around the mid section and if you arent strong enough to pull him down he cant shake free and the other guys will finish him off.|`|e894306bd6e6464fd9007daa0dc1fa25aa	Go for the legs.|`|f8feafb23ba096dc3443347a96c05ad7aa	definitly the legs|`|769e1b2b9dbf1f807979a5a59d08005eaa	go for the legs and if that does not work have a teamate help you take him down|`|AA11348030	I agree with most of what vip hockey said but I would add a few things.   1. Run through the tackle. That means run as hard as you can into the player you are trying to tackle. Cause a COLLISION. Watch an NFL or college game. Usually the safeties are not physically big, but they are big hitters. They do exactly what I referenced above - cause a collision. Separate someone from the ball. Make a play.     2. Wrap up. Wrap your arms around the player you are trying to tackle and do not let go. This works especially well combined with what vip wrote. Wrapping your arms around a players legs can be hard because his are probably stronger than your arms.Go for his hips/waist and wrap up   3. Hit with attitude. I don't mean talk smack afterward - but hit hard. - everytime.|`|792c44a8727e4b0242a27f1418bc4864aa	legs! works everytime! i can even take my brother down and he's 210! he played football as well and taught me to go for the legs|`|AA11850981	what those grls said  feet  and hang on  dont let go  and dont be scared to hit

5xnSgTYnaa	outfielders are as important as everybody on the team. you all have to function as one in order to even win. If there were no outfielders then i guarantee that the team would suck. I have played with no outfielders and I was destroyed.|`|28c0495788bedefa03a0bf8e36f5ed48aa	Back when I was in little league the sucky player was usually put in right field.

G72VxS6Jaa	Try the Better Basketball videos.  Although extremely cheesy, they are extremely informative.  If you don't want to spend the money, then just search on google for different drills.  You can find everything on the video for free on the internet.  You can also try downloading them for free via torrents, but I don't recommend doing that because it is illegal.<br>  <br>  The advantage to getting the dvd is that it compiles all the information and you get to actually see it and not just read it.  It teaches you the fundamentals.  You can be a great player without fundamentals, but fundamentals get you there faster.|`|AA11459034	theres better basketball dvds that have shooting and dribbling drills on them. you can order them on the internet. they help a lot!

AA11156479	Warm up, stretch a lot your arms, legs and torso, at this age I would junk the slider, and take it easy on the split, work on your location with your fastball and change. If you are lucky as your hands get bigger and you grow you will be able to impart movement on your fast ball and change with out the violent twisting that comes with the slider or regular curve. It also depends on how you throw sidearm, do you sling it up there or are you more over the top to 3/4. Sidearm can has a tendency to put more stress on the elbow and shoulder than over the top.  Also if you are serious about baseball, quit football, maybe play basketball if you want a second sport or tennis or cross country.  And one last thing do not take any of this seriously, every answer is just advice do what you feel like doing, within reason, and just enjoy the games you play.|`|533cbd5eb0dd99b30a5f8427d0b02ac8aa	Be careful about the amount of breaking balls you throw.  In the long run, they could damage your arm.|`|rP6S1f2Oaa	I would not throw anything that twists the elbow. Rather use pitches where you just have to change finger position. Look at johan best pitcher in base ball uses primarily a fastball and change up and dominates hitters. Get you fastball fast and your change up motion and speed solid and you will be fine the curve is over rated look at zito.|`|4a38ee57af7d1483ca19e42655814c15aa	Throwing the fastball won't hurt. But don't throw the breaking balls. Use those in situations. Like in a 0-2 count. Throw a fastball twice. Then throw a knucklecurve, changeup, or a slider.|`|40g1YBEsaa	Nope. One bad throw of a pitch can ruin youre season. Being a QB is the same as being a pitcher, they both have risks. Chose Wisely.|`|e06f302dac5c33292534b703a4e900fbaa	All those pitches are safe except for maybe the knuckel curve. I had a pitching coach who told me not to throw a curve yet and i was 14. But if you know how to throw the curve the right way and have proper mechanics it should be fine. You just dont want to overwork your arm and wear it down|`|6cUuifYEaa	Just be sure to always warm up that arm before playing either sport. Also be sure to excercise that arm everyday..just throwing naturally..and lifting weights..but dont over do it ! I know that sounded contridictive. Basically keep your arm toned up..dont go into a game with a cold arm...that's when it might hurt. Say you pitch for 4 innings and your arm starts to hurt..tell the coach..dont feel that you have to continue. If you set up a work-out each day..you should be able to build up the endurance of that arm and be able to pitch for longer. As long as you keep your arm toned..it should not affect your playing football or vice versa  Good luck to you.|`|065b430f4b4b9a58a8c14fa3b764d8c1aa	At your age, the only pitches you should be throwing are fastballs.  You should never, NEVER even try to throw any type of a breaking pitch until the growth plates in your arm have closed.  That something that can only be determined by a doctor, with the help of x-rays or other medical imaging.    Your coach needs to be taken to the proverbial woodshed for allowing you to throw breaking pitches.
0hEhvulHaa	I would rather own Damon and Oswalt then Dunn and Nathan.  Then again, it depends on your needs.  The only (I'm mean only) reason you would want to pull the trigger on this trade is if you need saves and home runs.  Damon will help you across the board and Oswalt is a top tier SP...Dunn will obviously provide more HR but will lose out to Damon in the other categories.  Oswalt and Nathan I consider a wash since they will both provide good pitching numbers.    If I knew who else is on your team, I  could give you a better answer.  Good luck!|`|4875ee8b7cbffd120084702d73bb6ab0aa	its a fair trade if you can afford to give up steals and wins/k's for Homers and Saves. Make sure the trade helps balance out your team. Usually the best trades are the ones that help both sides.|`|5d7f439011a6cbed3f40abae190694d3aa	I think thats a major mistake.  Damon and Oswalt are a lot better then Dunn and Nathan.  Damon will have better Run, Average and SB numbers than Dunn (possibly the same RBI numbers.  Dunn will get more homers but will kill your BA.    Secondly Oswalt is a starter and worth more then the best closer.  Oswalt goes in 2nd round Nathan in 3rd-4th.  Never trade a true ace for a closer.  Oswalt will get more SO and wins and will help your teams ERA, and Whip.  Nathan will get you saves and only help your team in ERA and whip as well.  (not enought SO and limited Wins)      So Damon is better then dunn  and Oswalt is better then Nathan.      This means a double loss for you.|`|AA11566819	I like the Nathan Oswalt part of the deal, but not the Damon Dunn part of it.  Especially in rotissiere leagues, Dunn's average is a liability.  Unless your league counts OPS, I think I'd try and trade Oswalt for another closer, or do it as a one for one leaving the outfielders out of it.  Look at K-Rod or Ryan.  Because of their strikeout totals I prefer them to Nathan.  Maybe you can get one of them and a better OF than Dunn for Oswalt and Damon.|`|AA10613925	I wouldn't do it. Dunn may give you a lot of HR's, but he will kill you in average. Damon will give you about 20 HR's, and a decent avg. Oswalt is one of the best SP's in the NL, and while Nathan is a great RP, it isn't worth it. I would only do this trade if you are in desperate need of a closer and/or HR's.
TyDMvaU5aa	Yes.  Among all current players, he is without a doubt the best player right now.  Plus, he isn't a ballhog nor is he a showboat.  And he does make his other teamates better which is actually the measure of how great a player is.|`|ec98d07bfe5bfe255a0b28efc34464ccaa	naw not da best but he is real good though and he is 1 of da best|`|408da6bb55ad956c4a3f27375faa6ee5aa	i like RICHARD"RIP"HAMILTON|`|925ade003362a05c557afa5dda910c59aa	childsplay, are you kidding me? wade has been out with a shoulder injury, how can he be the best player right now?|`|AA11110404	kobe's a better player in my opinion. yes i live in LA and ive been a LAL fan all my life but kobe is more talented all the way around. hes a stronger leader and d-wade has played some poor games.. plus do you hear anyone chanting mvp for wade? especially not in their own arena
6507ff9957bc514453137ec3213d56e7aa	Almost, because I've used all of those decks and I'm still using almost decks. they make them all out of a fiberlight resin making them light and damn they have nice pop. elements fiber deck might be nice but i'll never know, not going to spend that kind of money on a deck when I'm good enough to do the same on wood.|`|oB65yPFpaa	Yeah|`|AA11644972	Almost, because I've gone to a skateshop and compared decks. Element is much heavier, and has their little petty hype thingys (fiberlight! Helium!) which just gives them reputation. Everyone loves Element because of Bam, adnd because they make such cool graphics on the bottom. Almost does not have a lot of hype (unless you count the new ones, Uber light and Impact Support. Impact support is a basic Almost board with carbon discs on the part where you put the trucks on, preventing breakage Uber Light has a carbon middle that acts as a skeleton, making it hella rigid and easier to flip). Their decks have Resin-7 and 8, which makes the deck more rigid, and more tolerant.|`|qrn2ocXgaa	element|`|AA11110404	definetly element. the boards are better quality..but you do have to pay more for them *ususally*

Born and raised rootin for the Browns and spends his career with them and is inducted  3) It would shut everyone up about 'He can't win the big game'|`|m2A8ohARaa	I'm leaning towards Quinn.  He had some great receivers at Notre Dame and the Browns have some good receivers as well.      Cribbs could be a longshot to make the Hall too.  Nothing like a former college QB to come in and take a few snaps as well, giving Coach Crennel a chance to run a QB option.|`|oWvvH83aaa	Its got to be Quinn. The guys living my dream. As a kid growing up in Ohio I always dreamed of playing QB for Notre Dame and then for the Browns.    All that aside, the Browns made some terrific off season acquisitions. Lets hope they can start to turn this team around. Its just not right for them to be so bad so long.
MUvZ5CAtaa	Taylor is still the main guy with the Vikings, so he'll probably end up spliting carries with him throughout the season.   Barring injuries I believe that he'll put up 700-800 yards and 8-10 tds.|`|0iMYQ3STaa	Better than anybody they've had in a long time. They have a real decent line, so if he starts this year he could be near the top with guys like S. Jackson and F. Gore. If he splits time with Taylor, he'll be in the C. Benson/D. Rhodes (of last year) tier.|`|4aqD3RhSaa	His rookie season I think he'll rush for 1400, 12 td's. That's if he can go without injury and if he starts. I know Chester Taylor still starts for them. If Chester still starts, he gets 800 yards, 7 td's.|`|431e7cadaede1a05a1d24b22185e6f6caa	I think he will have a mediocre season as far as stats. The Vikings have a great runner in Chester Taylor and don't need to rush Peterson to be the main guy. It is also just his rookie season. It normally takes a year for new players to truly get adjusted to the NFL. He will be a good RB in the NFL, but I wouldn't look for amazing stats until next year.    700 yrds and 4 Tds|`|mWy4VctBaa	well in his first season, unless taylor gets hurt, he will mainly be a third down back and a goal line runner getting many td's
GNVGsrTTaa	I don't know. But, I think it is because they see the players that they voted for being picked as reserves and automatically think "Oh, I guess the fans voted him in."    It is not entirally true that we do not vote for pitchers. The entire Final Vote players are all pitchers. But, I know what you mean. They are not even listed on the ballot. Managers, coaches, and players pick the pitchers & reserves.    As for the players vote and rule about a player representative from each team; that is bogus. Why does each team need a representative? This is suppose to be the best players in the league, but ones that are forced in because the players didn't know who else to vote for on the team!|`|yXKV9Nicaa	People generally only read what they want to see.

Your league chooses a certain time and the whole league opens up this draft operator and drafts players when it is their turn.    Auto - Means that whatever provider of your Fantasy Football automatically chooses players for your team and you won't need to see them being drafted because in a while you will automatically have a team ready.    Offline - Means that your league gets together in reality (only works if your whole league can meet together in reality) and drafts by yourself and then the commisioner says who drafted who to start the teams off.

Im taking a snooze wake me up when WWE books quality shows.|`|AA11921177	I think that's about right except I think Triple H will go against King Bookah instead since King Booker keeps complaining about Triple H as well as being the "King of Kings" that maybe it will be a triple threat in there or something because he is set to return at Summerslam. And Orton is probably going to take the title from Cena since HHH was pushing for it and John Cena is set to leave in September anyways to shoot a movie.|`|iYaSBXOnaa	nawhh i think its gonna be   umaga vs. jeff.|`|wEwtjjHMaa	cena will finally lose!!!!!!!!|`|a2a522c226da9ac93cfcf696a2e46897aa	jerry the king will defeat king bookah    lashley will defeat carlito    cena will defeat orton    jeff hardy will defeat kennedy    all you have said is right but you have forgotten the best thing in summer slam    and the best thing is about the game (triple h) and from summer slam the game will start.|`|uQRwshMHaa	looks like it

De plus, prendre la coupe du monde comme seul repere est un erreur. Dans les matchs du top 14 et de la heineken cup (= coupe d'europe de rugby), les tarifs sont trs trs infrieurs  ceux pratiqus dans le football.    Pour mmoire, le rugby, dans ses origines, taient un sport litiste et bourgeois mais depuis plus d'un sicle, il s'est trs largement popularis et ruralis (mme si cette dernire tendance tend peu  peu  disparaitre), devenant un vrai sport populaire.

Limiter les passe-droits ? Ceux-ci sont le fait des gros sponsors, qui ont fondu sur le rugby comme sur tous les autres sports populaires. Cette volution me semble malheureusement inluctable.    Une piste (qui est dj epxloite je pense) serait de rserver prioritairement des places aux vrais passionns : ceux qui pratiquent, ou ceux qui vont rgulirement au stade (pas forcment celuide Paris) toute l'anne.

Eev5vpMeaa	The Silver Slugger Award is a very old reward that is given to the best hitter at there position. (including pitcher) The reward is known to be even harder to get then the MVP award because it it totally based on hitting and hitting alone.|`|34b825defa82546f0ed991438bf0684daa	This is a strictly OFFENSE award. The Silver Slugger Awards are given out to the best HITTERS at each position in BOTH leagues. So 18 are given out each year.    It's similiar to Gold Glove Awards given out for defense for each position in BOTH leagues.|`|897e84e9120aefc8c02e15455552da44aa	wiki can help.|`|J0VnEXlLaa	arrite, little basball lesson right here. the silver slugger award is an ancient award. i mean seriosly, its old as rocks. but anyways, it goes to the player at each position with the best batting avg.. and that means down to the ten thousandth if they have to. it's a tough award to get. hope that helps.|`|922d47b2f4cef80931090217f00652d6aa	try wiki|`|2Tg2kAcgaa	It's given to the most offensive player at each position, in both the National and American League.|`|VcozLUhaaa	It goes to the player in each position with the most HR's for their season.|`|PqcxdR3Vaa	it is given to the player who performs best at his position in batiing.

"No comment" means he doesn't want the spotlight  -- just the opposite of how a cry baby would behave.|`|AA11725969	Self explanatory. He doesn't want to say anything because he thinks Bonds uses the Roids.|`|cOXBegMhaa	Hank Aaron is a cry baby.  Even if Bonds did not do steroids he would still cry about how the  players today have supplements they can buy at GNC that can help them bulk up.  He does not want his record broken period.  And in the end who really cares because years from now when A-Rod crushes the record, it won't matter.|`|5d203bfaa8330431d39fa240aea653b2aa	What does this say to you?

Cryme Tyme on the other hand was a great team. They had great teamwork and worked together most of the time. They were great solo wrestlers too and I was hoping that they could win the World Tag Team championships soon in the future but I guess that isn't going to happen.

gAooDWwfaa	really    because i get sick of wwe marks talking **** about TNA    how it's all WWE rejects, HELLO look how many people on the WWE roster came from WCW and ECW,people like that just need to shut the hell up because they obviously don't know ****    Edit:I wasn't speaking do you specifically, but isn't it hypocritical to complain about TNA fans ragging on WWE when TNA fans have to deal with stupid WWE marks bitching about how TNA is all WWE rejects    2nd Edit:exhibit a-1/2 owner of KYR    3rd edit:exhibit b-kraize and laize or whatever their name is|`|777bb5cdb16d0cbf43218a2a8f793dffaa	Hmmm, I don't remember anyone saying TNA is more popular.  I think what people are saying is ... TNA is a better "wrestling" product in their eyes.|`|0f1becc402fe8773e15b70db0bafb0cbaa	yea tna fans are stupid, they think tna better just cuz they got cage,kurt, and somoe, uuuummmmm ratings show other wise. tna will never catch on.|`|58d6b4483a329162e1f9eeafcf972793aa	I watched TNA the other night and noticed a few things.    Billy Gunn or whatever his name is now the Fame Asser his finishing move,  was hilarious. He used to be able to jump in the air and perform the move, now he just rest his leg on the opponents head and drop down.    Scott Steiner was out of breath by the time he ran down to save Samoa Joe from the Beatdown.    Raven stills believes he can wrestle.    Kevin Nash looks about 65 years old.    Oh... and The WWE is better by far.|`|eQ3IU9sHaa	TNA has no drama wwe is way better than TNA|`|DG262NWwaa	It depends on the storylines|`|1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	I don't think I've seen anybody say TNA is more "popular" than the WWE; that would be ludicrous.  TNA has a one-hour show per week; the WWE has about 675 hours of programming across 97 channels per week (sarcasm, people).  TNA doesn't have the marketing budget of the WWE, nor the merchandising.  TNA doesn't have their stars making movies and TV appearances on other non-wrestling shows.  In short, TNA is still an "indie"-type promotion with mostly relatively unknowns.    But I agree with a lot of people, and I tell anybody who asks, TNA has better wrestling than the WWE.  TNA puts on better PPVs.  TNA has fewer stupid storylines.  TNA has my favorite in-ring performer (Kurt Angle).  TNA's X Division (before Kevin Nash pissed all over it) was far superior to the WWE's cruiserweight division.  My opinion is TNA has the better product but I still watch and (mostly) enjoy RAW and Smackdown; ECW  should be put out of it's misery.|`|Vve4uMwGaa	Stick it in their faces. WWE will always be bigger.
WjLHoaxlaa	Tom McCreery hit 3 in one game on July 12, 1897.  A ton of guys have two.  the thing is though that if you go back far enough baseball fields did not have walls, so all home runs were "inside the park.".  Even once they had walls, most of them were really far away, and the ball was kind of soft, so the majority of home runs were inside the park.|`|WthJx6Vaaa	The most inside the park home runs in one game is 3 by Tom McCreery on the Louisville Colonels on July 12, 1897.

Rivers is a good QB but I'm a little shaky with Leinart. There has to be a better QB than Leinart in the FA.    Your WR's are good. They are very strong. I'm not to sure about Horn though. He might not have that good of a year without Vick and they will run the ball more. I would start Hackett over Horn.    RB's are good. Dunn will get you more points now that Vick is gone. They will run the ball more often. Peterson should have a good year. He's a good  3 RB.    Your TE's are weak. There is probably someone better in the FA. I would also pick up Owen Daniels.    Any kicker would do pretty much...    San Diego will have a great year. TB will have a so-so year. Your fine there.    I would give you a 6/10.    Good Luck

rCStxMByaa	It's fine.    You can actually do some really cool powerslides when it is wet out, but be careful--the slipperiness can take some getting used to.    The only downside is that you will rust out your bearings pretty quickly if you ride in the rain a lot.  It's good to have a spare deck with old bearings(trucks can get a bit rusty, too, but that doesn't matter so much) on it for that purpose--don't go ruining your brand new swiss racing bearings by riding through puddles.    Update:  Yeah, the WD40 will help a bit, but it's not a long-term lubricant.  You can actually strip some of the lube form the bearings by using it too much.  I'd try to get some chain grease from a bike shop instead, because that will keep your bearings running smooth.  Also, how far you're riding makes very little difference--the bearings will stay wet after you hop off the board, and will continue to rust even after you're inside.  You could dry them off with a paper towel or something, or just decide it doesn't matter--but you will shorten the bearings' lifespan by riding in the wet.|`|2e6c8f664207d104bb43aebe68defb24aa	the rain will do a few things to  your board like rust the bearings or make the deck itself heavy and water logged and will break alot easier if you use it to skate in the rain alot..I do somtimes but i have spare decks laying around and i always give my board away after a session in the rain as its no good for me and ill break it the next day becouse its weak from the water..|`|si32Wv4xaa	it is ok but the rain will damage ur skateboared in a few places like the grip tape and u wont have that much grip for u to stand on it without falling|`|KmL6BzKjaa	anything is.. just be carefull...

0zaHXtUyaa	Rillie Fingers!!|`|CR6sYBzgaa	1. Tony Gwynn - one of the greatest contact hitters of all time    2. Harmon Killebrew - one of the greatest home run hitters of all time    3. Rollie Fingers - maybe the greatest relief pitcher of all time    4. Juan Maruchal - best Giants pitcher since they moved to San Francisco    5. Gary Carter  - No doubt the greatest Expos player of all time. 11 time All Star    6. Fred Lynn - one of two players (Ichiro) to win Rookie of the Year and MVP in the same year in 1975.    7. Andre Dawson - 438 Career Home Runs, 1977 NL Rookie of the Year, 1987 NL MVP, 8 time All Star, 8 Gold Gloves    8. Monte Irvin - One of the first black players after Jackie Robinson, had a great career in both the Negro and National League with the Giants    9. Kevin Mitchell - Won a MVP award and one of the best catches of all time (ran across left field to catch a ball bare handed)    10. Matt Williams - Guy who played for a long time with the Giants. Ended up in Arizona where he won a championship in 2001.    11. Robby Thompson (make sure that it is not Bobby Thompson, if it is I put him in between Dawson and Irvin) -  Robby Thompson played his entire career with the Giants, won a rookie of the year, and was an all star twice. Bobby Thompson was a three time all star. He is most known for hitting the "Shot Heard 'Round the World" against the Dodgers in 1951 (possibly the most famous home run of all time).|`|lRHaiD9Zaa	If you are getting them for yourself, get the ones most meaningful to you.    If you are getting them for resale, i'd suggest checking on ebay for prices.  Tony Gwynn is famous and is going into the HOF this summer., so his sig might be hot right now.  Ditto Cal Ripken Jr.  Both these guys are very fan friendly and have probably signed tons of stuff for fans though.  That lessens their value because they're more common.    Sorting by fame is subjective but here's my list.  Tony G., Juan Marichal, Rollie Fingers, Andre Dawson, Gary Carter,  H. Killerbrew, Fred Lynn, Monte Irvin    Robby Thompson was a SF Giant for all of his 11 years but  never really distinguished himself.  BOBBY Thompson however was a NY Giant and , according to baseball-reference.com is still alive.  Bobby's "Shot Heard Round The World" is one of the most famous moments in MLB history.  If he is there, i'd put him at the top of the list.    Best of luck!|`|0f19164b7455155cacbcb3356b0fa414aa	I'd go with the older guys first. Robby Thompson is a good place to start, see if you can get him to inscribe the ball with "the shot heard around the world"  that will add a lot of value.  You can also they and get balls that relate to the player like an 86 WS ball for Carter, then try and get an "86 Champs" inscription.  Getting their stats added makes the ball more valuable too, like the saves for fingers, or the year they went into the hall of fame.    I say to start with the older guys because, well they are old, and once they're gone they will get harder and harder to get and the prices will go up and up.    If i had to pick five of those I'd pick these and go in this order: Robby Thompson,Harmon killebrew, Rollie fingers, tony Gwynne and Gary carter.  Assuming you mean Bobby Thompson, that is otherwise scrub robby thompson and add andrew dawson at the back of the list.|`|pgUFBLR0aa	TONY GWYNN first by far. Easily one of the two greatest hitter ever (Ted Williams is the other). A great keepsake.    Then in order    Gary Carter- 1992 World Series winning homer for the Blue Jays    Monte Irvin- A legend in the Negro Leagues and one of the first black players in the mlb    Rollie Fingers- Aside from a sweet mustache, he won Cy Young and MVP the same year    Harmon Killebrew- 573 homers    Andre Dawson- ROY, MVP, Over 400 Home Runs, 300 stolen bases, 8 gold gloves    Fred Lynn- The first player to ever win Rookie of the Year and MVP in the same season, Ichiro is the only other        the rest are good, but these are top notch|`|2PYqGdi8aa	I really wany Tony Gwynn and Juan Marichal  But get the one who you like most.

Guazzini a fait beaucoup pour le stade fran?ais mais aussi pour le rugby professionnel en gnral avec des innovations, la cration d'un vrai public.

Ils ont une norme quipe de trs bons entra?neurs, celui qui donne cette dimension buisness, commercial et tutti cuanti qui nous cette mauvaise image c'est Guazzini.  Le rugby est un sport plus prsent dan sle sud ouest qu'au nord de la loire et je suis pour son dveloppement sur tout le territoire fran?ais mais je suis contre le fait de le transformer en show  l'amricaine, dfil de mode, reproduction du bouclier de brennus en vente  plus de 200  (au fait c quoi ce dlire !!!????) oprations promotionnelles  la mort moi le noeud (style speed dating avec les joueurs). L'impact de cette image commerciale il est simple : oui le stade de France est rempli  tous les matchs, oui il engrange un max de pognon avec un public qui ne conna?t ni le rugby ni son esprit (cf les sifflements contre l'arbitre ou le 10 adverse quand il tente une transformation ou une pnalit et c'est  Paris que l'on constate cela le plus frquemment). Les joueurs ne sont pas des morceaux de viandes et le rugby n'est pas  vendre  n'importe quel prix.

FeyO5GE9aa	I actually think you have an excellent team. I'd upgrade at RB, because Portis will probably get injured again, and as of now, Jones-Drew is splitting time with Fred Taylor. Also, you could try and get another QB as a backup. I personally don't like Pennington, and he's always a huge injury risk.|`|3N3g0atlaa	RB mos Def and TE|`|TE6Ba7Spaa	Your QB's are good. Manning is the best in the NFL and is very consistent. Pennington is a good back up.    Your WR's are very good. Evans is a great WR along with Coles and Brown.     Clinton Portis will have a good year as will Taylor and MJD. MJD will also get you receptions for some more points.    Cooley is suppose to have a good year. He is a good TE that could have a break out year.    Any kicker would do pretty much...    NE is a great DEF to have.    How many teams are in this league?

It may be wise for team 1 to sub Curtis in for Calvin because the Vikings D is ruthless and the eagles play the Redskins.    Team 2 needs a stronger running back in the  2 position.

Car Mignoni a su dmontr lors du tournoi et du match qu'il sait le mieux diriger les avants.  Skrela avec son jeu au pied et sa grosse prsence dfensive permettra d'avoir une dfence forte avec un jeu d'agression (dfense poussive)  puis en deuxime mi temps, skrela passe en 12, permettant un bon jeu au pied et michalak entre en 10 lui qui est meilleur que skrela  la main donnera de la folie au jeu et ainsi dpasser l'adversaire qui a t us en 1ere mi temps par une dfense poussive   cqfd|`|SeF12uzpaa	mignoni/michalak! mais pr cela il faut mettre skrela sur le terrain pr la botte...(en 13 car Jauzion est bien meilleur en 12 comme on a pu le constater contre les gallois)....jouant en 3eme ligne je peux vous dire qu'avoir Mignoni quand il joue avec ses gros autours des points d'impact c'est l'assurance d'avoir des ballons dans le timing parfait, la passe vs met dans les meilleurs conditions possibles (angles de courses, intervalles, distance par rapport au rideau defensif)...de plus il ejecte plus vite qu'Elissalde, accelere plus le jeu...aprs le choix sera trs tactique...contre les argentins Skrela serait pas mal pr defendre en 10 (je pense que ce sera un match ferm) mais les argentins du stade francais le connaissent parfaitement|`|wGvOOgNJaa	je prendrai le risque de refaire jouer Michalak en 9 et laisser skrela en 9. ils sont tres complementaires|`|uLxA9OIxaa	ellissalde michalak avec skrela qui jouerait centre...

En plus, c'est la charnire la plus exprimente en quipe de France, avec les meilleurs repres puisque cela fait longtemps qu'ils jouent ensemble au Stade et en quipe de France. Aussi, comme beaucoup d'arrires sont du Stade Toulousain (Yannick Jauzion, Clment Poitrenaud, Vincent Clerc, Cdric Heymans ...), l aussi ils ont l'avantage des rpres du club !!

Ellisalde en bon rempla?ant. Et pourtant je suis toulousain!|`|7a04001fb03b1c26ab8cbaad504dc444aa	Mignoni Skrela sans hsitation. Mignoni a un jeu plus vari et est plus roublard. De plus il sait se taire l o Elissalde, form  l'cole Novs, pleurniche  longueur de temps. Ca peut couter une pnalit inutile!!  Skrela est trs rgulier dans son jeu au pied et est gros dfenseur. Par ailleurs je lui trouve une vista que Michalak a eu en club mais n'a jamais dmontr avec le maillot bleu.    Michalak est par contre meilleur dans les passes au pied et a un cot "french flair" qui peut dbloquer une rencontre ou les packs s'affrontent.|`|0674d7ae579b235b76ad0f8e9d871d17aa	M'en fous.

Au niveau des n10, michalak est de loin mon 1er choix: c'est un joueur qui est a mon sens exeptionnel quand il est en forme, il a cette capacit a naviguer devant et a l'interieur des dfences, a faire jouer sa ligne de 3/4 que skrla n'a pas. Il a un jeu trs imprvisible (contrairement a celui de skrla que je trouve un peu lent, plat et strotyp)et une bonne complmentarit avec Jauzion qui est incontstablement notre meilleur trois quart. Srla est lgrement meilleur en dfense mais je pense que michalak est suprieur et a un jeu plus spectaculaire de surcroit. J'aurais bien aim voir Mignoni-Michalak. Sachant que je trouve bauxis un peu lger dans le jeu mais c'est lui le meilleur buteur de l'quipe.|`|sT8l1lIYaa	michalak bien sur|`|4d0d7325879a62d01da8c64bf9b6d50aaa	Pour moi, la prsence de David Skrela ne se discute pas... C'est un gnie et pour moi de loin le meilleur joueur fran?ais!  Il flaire le jeu, a de l'intuition offensive et un gros impact dfensif. De plus son jeu au pied est un grand atout pour l'quipe de France. Il y longtemps que la France n'a pas eu un tel buteur, il peut buter mme de plus de 40 mtres mme sur les angles.  Michalak ne tient pas la forme mais reste un bonne option en cas de fatigue ou de blessure.  Mignoni a du punch.  Donc  100 % Skrela. Il faut miser sur Skrela et esprer de la chance|`|MQrWd4kKaa	c'est ce qu'il y a d'inquitants dans la prparation de l'quipe de France. A 10 jours du match contre l'argentine, le 10 n'est pas connu. Il y a bien des points positifs dans cette quipe, mais en rugby, le 10 est un peu l'quivalent du chef d'orchestre. Alors Michalak ou Skrela ? Finalement ca importe peu maintenant, la philo de Laporte a toujours t de monter une quipe capable de s'adapter  l'adversaire du jour. Contre l'argentine, je pense qu'il va faire jouer Michalak et le faire souffler les deux matches suivants.|`|JNaaXEM6aa	J'opte pour Mignoni / Skrela.

Elissalde, malgr des qualits videntes a donn des signes de fbrilit (vitesse et prcipitation) et Michalak, parfois capable du meilleur est aussi susceptible de se planter et l'quipe de France avec lui (pas assez de comptition au haut niveau ces derniers mois, de belles choses mais un manque de srnit et des prises de dcision hatives pas toujours les meilleures), dans quatre ans peut-tre...|`|hKNTkepdaa	plut?t mignoni skrla cette charnire a bien fonctionne pendant le dernier tournois|`|4ec051e571f6a4b8e45bfcc215d9c0f4aa	michalak aussi !!!!|`|lMlBROGRaa	j'ai mieux:  mignoni ou elissalde  la mle (avec une preference pour elissalde, pour son jeu au pieds et son experience, mais mignoni a su montrer pas mal de choses!)  michalak  l'ouverture  et une association jauzion skrela au centre ( inedite mais skrela a montre de tres bonnes choses, plaquages, passes, capacites a transpercer a ce poste)|`|tVZPxsuraa	La meilleure possibilit est la suivante :  Mignoni en 9, Beauxix en 10 et David Skrla en 12. Ellisalde  rempla?ant.    A noter que :    Michalak : Il a prouv qu'il tait lunatique (se rappeler la derniere coupe du monde. J'y tais en Australie!!)    Beauxix : Malgr son jeune age a t sacr champion du monde des moins de 21. Il est le meilleur des buteurs. Il sera notre releve pour le futur (il faut qu'il joue pour s'amliorer).  De plus, le connaissant, je peux me permettre de l'engueuler, rires !!    Skrla : Etant en concurrence avec Lionel, je le trouvais mauvais....manque de recul et d'objectivit. Avec le temps j'ai appris  le connaitre et j'en retire cet enseignement : Il est individuel, plus que lionel, donc bon pour effectuer des perces et pour briller...un atout en ce sens la.    Mes notes :     1- buteur :  Beauxix     = 18  Michalack =  13  Skrela       =  16    2- passeur :  Beauxix     = 18  Michalack =  16  Skrela       =  16    3-stratgie :  Beauxix     = 16  Michalack =  17  Skrela       =  18    4-individualisme :  Beauxix     = 14  Michalack =  16  Skrela       =  18    5-placage :  Beauxix     = 18  Michalack =  16  Skrela       =  18    6-experience :  Beauxix     = 17  Michalack =  17  Skrela       =  17    7-sang-froid :  Beauxix     = 18  Michalack =  15  Skrela       =  17    Dtails : Notez que ce n'est pas celui qui marque qui est le plus important  mes yeux mais celui qui a fait la passe dcisive dans l'action du jeu qui entraine  coup sur l'essai. Revoyez Fance-Galles, 4eme essai...    Conclusion : aucune !! laporte dcidera. Papa Skrela met son fils en avant (et cela se comprend) ; Galtier prfre Beauxix (et je le comprend). Mon doux reve, si Laporte lit ces lignes : Stratgie d'essai :    Le 9 passe  Beauxix (10) qui fait une passe saute  Skrela (12) et le choix  lui de refaire idem pour attendre l'ailier (ou option 2, individuel, perce dans les lignes adverses,etc..)...Ils ont failli le faire contre le pays de Galles mais pas assez rapidement...dommage !    Cordialement|`|UMaH2o5saa	Sans hsiter Ellissalde / Michalak avec Skrela au centre car il dfend plutot bien ...|`|BscEOC5Raa	plutot michalak.quel gabarit!!on ne peut pas rester insensible|`|7KZPgBixaa	Choix difficile !  Mignoni ou Ellisalde ? Mignoni semble lgrement meilleur animateur, et plus en cannes, alors qu'Elissalde est un bon animateur et surtout un redoutable buteur.  Donc lger avantage  Elissalde.  Pour le 10, plus complexe!  Skrla est un redoutable dfenseur, pas trop mal au pied, mais vraiment rien d'extraordianaire pour aller au bout...(c'est loin de Carter par exemple!!).  Michalak, quant  lui, est capable de tout! Le meilleur comme le pire, te faire gagner  lui seul , te faire perdre  lui seul. Il prsente en plus moins de garanties au pied.  Pour moi le choix idal reste Beauxis (qui en plus a peu jou, donc trs frais), qui allie finalement Michalak et Skrla en une personne.  Solide, bon dfenseur, bon  la main, bon au pied, jeune et aussi capable de tout.  Ne pas oublier qu'il fait gagner Paris  Toulouse cette anne sous des trombes d'eau, sur une pnalit dans les dernires minutes!

Skrela s'il n'est pas extraordinaire niveau crativit joue juste et est redoutable en dfense. Mignoni sort proprement et rapidement ses ballons. En remplacant Michalak peut, face  un adversaire fatigu, se rveler redoutable. De plus il est polyvalent ce qui lui permet de couvrir les deux postes de demis et ainsi d'avoir 5 avants sur le banc (trs utile contre des equipes physiques).|`|pwCRwMwlaa	Michalak|`|m1vbPeoqaa	Elissade Michalak sont au-dessus.

Je pense que Skrela, malgr son jeune age, est beaucoup plus solide mentalement, et plus ouvert sur le jeu avec ses coquipiers. Je prfre l'action collective,  l'individuelle. Elle se conjugue mieux avec le rugby.

Dirk's 2006-2007 statistics after 8 years as a NBA starter:    1) Dirk's worst year out of 8 years in 3 point FGs made by far making only 72 three pointers.  2) Dirk's worst year out of 8 years in steals.  3) Dirk's worst year out of 8 years in blocked shots.  4) Dirk's 6th best year out of 8 in rebounding (meaning his third to the worst year in rebounds per game).  5) Dirk's 7th best year out of 8 in defensive rebounding (meaning his second to the worst year in defensive rebounds per game).  6) Dirk's lowest scoring average in three years, and his second to the lowest scoring average in the last five years.  7) Dirk had one of his highest turnover years in his 8 years as a NBA starter.    Yeah, congrats, Dirk, you had a stellar regular season campaign in the 2006-2007 NBA regular season.    Dallas had one of the deepest teams in the NBA this past year bought with Mark Cuban money which contributed highly to Dallas' success in the 2006-2007 NBA regular season.    I can always tell when someone is losing several steps when they reach all time career lows in steals per game and blocked shots per game.|`|984cf5d692e4026812bef64a847ff5b5aa	Stop picking on Dirk. As much as I've wanted the Heat to win the Finals last year and the Mavs to win it this year, Dirk has been nothing but tremendous. It's just bad match up against the Warriors because the Mavs had a hard time playing small ball. Lessons learned and experiences earned, the Mavs will be back next year. If only the Mavs advanced, the Cavs would be facing the Mavs and not the Spurs. Im defending Dirk and Im a Yao Ming fan!!!!|`|pSQmACY1aa	Im a Dallas fan right here. and Dirk is a good piece of the puzzle.

Probably the best thing you can do is make friends with others who share your interests.  With one other person you could enjoy many activities.    Even though you don't like the gym in your town, you may want to visit it and talk to some of the folks there.  They might prefer, like you do, to exercise with a friend rather than the gym.    If there is an elementary school in your town it probably has a basketball court.  Maybe a tennis court too.    Cycling is a great outdoor activity and a good cardio workout.  Not a bad way to get around too.    I find Skating and/or Rollerblading less boring than running.    Softball / Baseball games like "over the line" or "three flies up" only need a few people.    Best of luck in whatever direction you choose.|`|iHWlXnrUaa	there r many ways to be active get some friends togeth for a pool party or even a baseball game, even a small park will do. frisbee is also quite a work out but it is easier to be active with ppl|`|aY9loaZdaa	You actually have the best thing for exercise...your pool is great. Swimming is one of the best ways to stay fit. If you don't like swimming by yourself I'm sure someone would swim with you if you asked.|`|C9UDSzYgaa	well it depends on where you live, but for the cheerleading idea, look online at allstar gyms close to your town. there may be one. now, if you've never cheerleaded before allstars might be difficult, but most have different levels to perform at. it's costly, but it's fun and you meet a lot of people from different towns. just go to google and search all star gyms in _______ and put your state in the blank. hope you find one and stay active =)

Qu'un cancreux arrive  remonter sur un vlo, c'est un honneur pour la science, mais de l  gagner le Tour de France, non ! et 7 fois de suite, qui plus est !  Il est curieux que les dirigeants aient pu se dire soulags de ce que Rabobank ait vir Rasmussen, que Holz puisse traiter Vinokourov de "Super-Zro", alors qu'ils n'ont jamais os s'en prendre  armstrong... Evidemment, la super-puissance, le Texas, le sponsor Discovery, le soutien officiel d'admiration complaisante de sarkoszy, c'est plus dur  dnoncer qu'un "petit" Danois ou un Kazakh "minus"...

Le TdF reste l'une des comptitions sportives les plus populaires au monde, donc rmunratrice de profits pour les organisateurs et un champ de marketing bon march pour les sponsors.  Alors ? ou toute la Direction du Tour est aveugle, botienne ou ignorante, ou alors on ouvre les yeux quand l'un se fait prendre.  Pas vu pas pris  !

Comment aprs cela peut-on les soupconner de "fermer les yeux" depuis plus de 20 ans sur les diffrentes histoires de dopage qui ont bien voulu (malgr un "consensus du silence") voir le jour au fil du tour..

AA11068854	i think everyone will resign but castillo and nathan, and i think hunter will retire|`|FeyO5GE9aa	I think that everyone will re-sign except Torii Hunter. There have been rumors that he is going to be leaving. Liriano, Santana, Morneau, Mauer, and Neshek are definetely staying.|`|mOUYLgShaa	Are all those guys free agents next year?  Only Castillo, Hunter, and Nathan are FA after this season, and I have doubts they keep Hunter or Nathan unless their owner opens up his fat wallet.  Hunter's price just went up since Ichiro is about to sign his extension, and these "small market" teams tend not to overpay for bullpen.  Castillo can re-sign since nobody wants him.  As for the rest, hopefully their new stadium brings them lots of cash and they re-sign that core of Santana-Mauer-Morneau, or their owner stops being cheap and signs them all, though I have doubts about Santana, he could command 200 mil easily.    They look good for '08, but playing in a division with the Indians and Tigers is rough since they look just as good next year, if not better. As for Liriano, he isn't a sure thing, his pitches are too good to be true, if he keeps pitching the way he did last season he can get hurt because all his pitches are just unnatural.  He's gonna need to make adjustments which is a shame, so the guy who was better than Santana for a whole half season might never be that good again.

All too often, I see posts on the Answers board complaining how WWE is boring these days, how we long for the days of the attitude era and "edgier" storylines.  Stories that weren't afraid to tackle taboo subjects like religion, politics, and sex.  Then when we finally get those stories, (for example the Kane necrophelia angle or the Muhammed Hassan angle) I see complaints the the WWE is going too far.  I don't mean for this to sound like a flame, so please accept my apology if you take it as such, but let's face it, this is WWE programming, not PBS.  If you think the stories they are telling on WWE programming are going too far, take some personal responsibility and change the channel.  The car bomb we saw last night on Raw was fiction, not reality.  I understand that WWE attempts to blurr the line between the two, but the important thing we all have to keep in mind is that we are watching fiction for the purpose of being entertained, not the Nightly News for the purpose of being informed.  As for me, I think this current story will be intriguing.  "Who killed Mr. McMahon?" will be a question that will be asked on WWE programming for months to come, and I for one will be tuning in to find the answer.|`|mVFc3WbZaa	ya did u see what they did they went way to far|`|C4JYCZFkaa	OK, in my opinion...you are making wayy too much of this.  its kind of ridiculous to bring in 9/11 and terror plots all b/c of a TV show.  i think you need to get a life outside of wrestling.  i was told that Vince did this because he is actually having some kind of surgery.  really...get over it.

Besides,I don't think they remembered the 9/11 tragedy.It was a tragedy,but no one really remembers it now,with exception to relatives of the victims.I remember some news just doing a small report about it last year.|`|AA10846501	aah be quiet its just a little fun and entertainment. car bombs were not invented by terrorist and have been around long before 9/11. countless  Hollywood movies have car bombings in them even movies released after 9/11, so whats wrong if wwe does it too.|`|YDSGtSf0aa	yes i agree about your thoughts but i found the incident really cool and i do think that the ratings will go up like rockets|`|P9mTI5oWaa	I think it was just done for the entertainment value...can't take everything so seriously.|`|TeFn2Jnjaa	They just want publicity.

CTQ1gwezaa	circle change and regular change. circle change has movement.  just choke the ball up in your hand and throw it like a fastball.  the choking of the ball will make it come out slower naturally.  the key to a good change is making it look like a fastball with your arm movement.|`|MgOorECbaa	change up is just thrown by palming the ball pretty much    the circle change is harder to throw make a circle with ur thumb and pointer finger and let the ball roll off of your pinky to give it the movement. remember, smaller the circle, the slower it goes|`|3fcfaf9a6e110c2709a1cd0e15281724aa	either hold like a fastball but further back in your hand OR put 3 or 4 fingers on the ball instead of two.  But remember to keep your arm speed and angle the EXACT same as your fastball.|`|AMfxpWDXaa	Justin throws both a circle and changeup. The proper way to throw a Circle Change is to bring your pointer finger and thumb together in a circle, put those on the side of the ball and then rest your other fingers on the ball. when throwing a regular change up, you need to grip the ball with all fingers and keep a regular pace going just like your fastball throughout the whole wind up. REMEMBER THIS: when throwing ANY type of change up. Try and use just your ring and pinky fingers to throw the ball. This will allow you to use a regular speed in your wind up and still throw the ball slow.   This will feel very weird at first, but once you practice it enough you will get your accuracy correct and it will feel normal. ALWAYS TRY TO KEEP YOUR CHANGE UP LOW OR ELSE IT GOING GOING GONE!!!
FEzsy6tdaa	You just have to work harder than everyone there even if you screw up you just have to go harder the next time and just tell your self that you are the best and thats what you need to show the coaches.

In the off season you can practice and make yourself better and give yourself a better chance of making it next year or to another team|`|ieHp1eXnaa	if you dont make it practice harder so u can improve so if your gonna try out again u can go in the team..dont give up easily..    your not always gonna win win win in your life you always have the ups and downs sometimes you fail, but if you believe in yourself you can succeed..     if your just gonna quit whats the point of you playing basketball anyways??    try and try until you succeed..|`|T5P4YjHQaa	Do not quit playing! I tried out for four teams before I found the right one and we won nationals last year. I had a blast, and if you really love the game you will keep playing.

Gva0qq3Yaa	It allows series to end on Sunday afternoons to give the players time to get to the site of the game.  Then a travel day to get back with their teams to resume championship play on Thursday.|`|lRHaiD9Zaa	Since most folks can attend games on the weekeknd, Sat and Sun are usually booked solid.  Fri night too.    Monday is almost always a travel day during the season.  So having the All-Star game on a Tuesday is the least disruptive to the regular season schedule.|`|QELXi5YVaa	Because its baseball!!!!|`|zDkuXkFGaa	I dunno, I never looked into it but I would guess because it would give players after the AS game 2 days off?

With K-Rod you won't be needing him.|`|0edeb715d6b6122dc862202fc0a546d7aa	No, Jorge Posada has only a few good years left in him,  and Frankie Rodriguez is an up and coming star....
xwuTBAlTaa	Eddie Gaedel at 3 feet 7 inches (109 cm) tall and weighing 65 pounds (29.5 kg). Although Gaedel appeared at the plate in a Major League Baseball game, he cannot be credited with an at-bat as he walked. According to official scoring, Gaedel is 0 for 0 in his career.|`|lRHaiD9Zaa	Eddie Gaedel appeared in only one game.  He was put into the game, more or less, for the pure fun of it.    Baseball Almanac says the next shortest is a ten-way tie at 5'3" .  The smallest guy I've seen was probably Freddie Patek.  second baseman for KC Royals.  He was 5'5".    Shortest Hall of Famer might be Bill Mazeroski.  2B for Pirates -- terrific fielder and famous for being first guy to hit a walk off homer to decide a word series.|`|Qeaa9makaa	After Gaedel batted, baseball outlawed Midget's from appearing in games. Not sure who the smallest is after him, but during the 70's the Royals had two really short guys playing for them. Freddie Patek and Cookie Rojas. Patek was 5' 5" and weighed 148 pounds. He played for 14 years. Rojas was 5' 10" and weighed  160 pounds. He played for 16 years.
Oxo24t5aaa	I think with that lineup T-Mac would play center.  They should trade Yao and Scola for Ben Gordon and Luol Deng.  That would be fun, they'd be unguardable but they wouldn't be able to guard anyone else either. Every game would be 300 points.|`|dh0yVpW7aa	DAMN IT! They don't need all them damn guards. Trade like half of them away. Stupid guard hoggers.|`|MgOorECbaa	Yao??  Chuck Hayes??    your not a true rocket fan unless you give chuck hayes all the credit in the world      the hustle that he puts into the game is astounding, he gets all of the dirty rebounds, takes all the charges, and does all of the dirty work that Yao of Tracy wont do|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	What about Yao Ming?

Minnesota gets nothing... no talent sent to them, and the only guy that makes them relevant gets packaged out. They could get SO MUCH more for Garnett. So this only happens if Golden State and the Kings send them 2 first round and 2 second round draft picks. Each.  Golden State completely sacrifice their future to get KG and sell some tickets. This team would not go any further than other KG teams.  The Kings... hell, why not? It probably doesn't make them very good, but they'll be better then they are now, and have a bunch of tradable assets, far more useful than their current personell. Really, it wouln't take them anywhere. But at least they'd be younger, and appear to be trying.|`|G7t9Xk0Zaa	I think you're a Warriors fan. This is a real dumb trade.

They definitely have the leadership and ability to go far, but the rest of their roster is mighty thin.  With aging vets, it's always good to have some back-up players.  I can't see the Celtics winning a championship with that roster, but they've taken steps to get a whole lot closer.  They'll need a PG who can play, maybe Rafer Alston.|`|aAT9i3Imaa	They will be a better team now and one of the top teams in the east i bet.

ZudmxIQoaa	If it's a 6 team league, then why aim for guys like Culter or Campbell?  You're looking at young qbs on teams that love to run.  Why aim so low?  Your goal should be to get 2 out of the top 10 QBs in the draft and no less.  Don't aim for the 15th and 20th best QBs.  If you really like those guys then take one of them as your 3rd QB.  I wouldn't go with 4 RBs at the start of the draft.  I always try for 3 rb in the first 3 picks, but like another poster said, you have to be flexible.  Taking 4 RB will leave you without a top 10 WR.  All the other teams would have thier starting RB and in a small league they can easily find 3rd and 4th RBs later in the draft.  Get RB with your first 3 picks, you'll end up with something like Gore, Addai, Henry.  After that you don't need another RB until all your skilled positions are filled.|`|431e7cadaede1a05a1d24b22185e6f6caa	I do not like that strategy. You should definately start RB, RB. However, you need to fill out others in your starting positions. You don't want to waste top picks on people that will ride your bench most if not ALL season long. At most I'd get 3 RB's if there's a stud still left out there by your 3rd pick. However, odds are other teams will have also moved onto other positions by then and they will thin out quickly. That also means that the RB you would have picked up has a decent chance of still being there in later rounds.|`|S8AUvykraa	Starting 2 Qbs is something I have never seen, but if you have to start 2, then your plan is a very bad one.  If there are only 6 teams, then that means there are plenty of running backs to be had by all. This means that they will get their running backs with ease, and then they can easily screw you over by not trading with you. You will be stuck with the Delhommes and Cutlers, basically just crap and potential. You need to go after one of the big 6 (Manning, Palmer, Brees, Brady, McNabb, Bulger) because if you do not get one of these, the drop to the next tier is big.     Plus, why the hell would you draft 4 WRs before 1 QB, when you ONLY START 2 WRs. Since you only start 2 WRs, and there are so many good WRs in the league to go around among 6 people, you have to get one of those top QBs.    RB RB QB WR WR, then go on from there|`|d8e86a2ae66b75b3ba26505886316385aa	Well i would start with 2 RB's then look for the best QB thats left then pick 3 or 4 WRs then get another RB or two then another QB or two and wait untill the last two rounds to get your DEF and K|`|Vs1FiM3daa	You need to be more flexible during the draft - look for the best scoring potential in your system regardless of position after the first couple of rounds. I wouldn't pick more than three RBs at the top of the draft, and then only if there was a third back that is well above the remaining ones. If you play 2 QBs in your league, you'll need at least three on the roster. I'd rather have at least one of the top tier QBs and have the others you mention as  2 & 3 than rely on basically unproven talent as the  1 QB.|`|krlyMxNDaa	additional good    first bad
boVn3wdvaa	Your team is OK...I think you need stronger running backs!  I mean I like Addai and Norwood but Brown is all they have in Miami and Turner is just a back up, but good to have if LT goes down!!  I like you wr's I would get rid of Moulds and pick up Hank Baskett from Philly!    Overall good team!|`|431e7cadaede1a05a1d24b22185e6f6caa	It looks like you have a solid team. I think you could have probably gotten a better QB instead of either Boldin or Fitzgerald though. It isn't the best idea to have 2 top WR from the same team. You do have a decent guy in S. Moss to fill that spot.    London Fletcher is my hero.

Beating lower level opponents doesn't count torwards your mandatory six wins to be bowl eligible or help you on BCS standings so logically it shouldn't hurt either.

jTyyl5Nkaa	NBALOVER, i know you like gargling on Lebrons nuts, but Ray Allen deserved the award. He scored more points with 12 minutes less playing time. This isn't a damn season game where you pull out rebound  's idiot, this is the all star game. All about the points.    Its a shame that people award things to lebron just cause they're caught up in the hype. This was Ray Allens award.|`|dDhTMacAaa	by the way 12-22 iv over 50%. (12-24 if 50%) LeBRon played great the whole way and got the fan-vote cause he's an icon. Ray was clutch but tidn't get the love in the voting.|`|UKU9HrQvaa	12-22 is 54% shooting, which is even more than 50% check your math.     and gee maybe it was the amount of points he scored, the rebounds, assists, and energy that made him MVP    ray allan had more points because he just shot more threes.   lebron james actually made an impact in more aspects of the game, not just three pointers and points.....plus did you see lebron posterize dirk?? MVP! MVP!!|`|vzkwYTvtaa	Ray Allen should have won.|`|o3d6vcixaa	Ray Allen should've been the MVP    I hate the Celtics but man Ray put on one helluva show in the 4th    Lebron was part of a snoozefest thru 3 quarters and then he starts hogging the ball in the 4th and holding onto the ball, letting the shot clock come down and then chuck up a shot    Then going for that stupid dunk just to show that he's in the court...what a loser    did you see the wide open 3 he airballed? haha    Lebron put up the stats against a careless defense because he handled the ball a lot and played a ton of minutes...Ray Allen came up big when it counted and was the difference maker in the win    I'm sick of this nonsense|`|YNJTjImtaa	Allen scored more points than Bron, but it was no. 23 who made the sealed the deal for the East team. It was not the last shots that will make you MVP, it was how you played the whole game and how you finished it. i believe that Bron finished the game strong and that was the other fans who voted for him saw!    Stop being jealous Kobe lovers!!! This isn't your time!! Give the King the honor he deserves!! Bow down to the KING 23!!!|`|pqMoHgDNaa	POINTS, 9 ASSISTS, 8 BOARDS 2 BLOCKS AND 1 STEAL      thats an MVP      on top of that   Lebron got the mvp   AND THERE IS NOT OINE THING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT>>>> SO SWOLLOW IT!!!!|`|fnNSKiOvaa	lebron only one cause hes popular. ray allen deserved it but lebron stole it when he doesnt deserve. yet another reason why I HATE LEBRON!!!!!!!!!|`|e30c13e56c21742931340decf861e45eaa	ur rite, ray allen definetely should have won this MVP award.   compare allen's numbers to lebron's...

3b09793608a1fe9fb0ebd092e0007168aa	Decir quien no se puede ya que Kobe aun es un jugador activo y Jordan es una leyenda del baloncesto mundial.  Si comparamos a Jordan con Kobe estariamos comparando un historial completo e impresionante de jordan contra un historia impresionante pero incompleto de kobe.  A mi parecer Jordan no tiene comparacion con nadie es el mejor del mundo y lo seguiraciendo por mucho tiempo.|`|gYj9LgAwaa	Fue? pero si Kobe todavia esta activo y no se puede comparar cuando Kobe se retire entonces si.|`|5OwAshvWaa	Michael Jordan, sin duda.     Me parece que, de los jugadores en activo, Kobe Bryant (incluso por encima de Lebron James) es el ms cercano a Michael Jordan, pero esto no quiere decir que est al nivel de MJ o que lo supere. Todava le falta mucho.     Jordan realmente era un monstruo en la duela, era un jugador que dominaba y aplastaba en ambos lados de la cancha: por un lado era letal en el ataque, mientras que en el otro era el principal defensor de su equipo.     En ocasiones suele olvidarse la gran capacidad defensiva que tena MJ, pero realmente fue uno de los mejores de la historia, impenetrable en los uno a uno y siempre duro con los rivales. Sin duda, Michael Jordan era mejor defensa de lo que es actualmente Kobe Bryant. El 23 de los Bulls era un marcador implacable, e incluso lleg a ganar el premio a jugador defensivo del a?o.    Quiz un aspecto en el que Bryant sea mejor que Jordan es en el tiro. Jordan realmente no fue un tirador de media y larga distancia muy destacado (al nivel de Larry Bird o Reggie Miller, por ejemplo), al contrario de Kobe, quien se distingue por una habilidad increble para anotar prcticamente de cualquier punto de la duela.    Un aspecto en el que me parece que estn empatados es en la capacidad atltica. Las volcadas, piruetas y maniobras de Michael Jordan hasta antes de su primer retiro eran espectaculares, al igual que las de Kobe actualmente.  Ambos fueron ganadores de concursos de clavadas.     Una ventaja muy marcada de Jordan era su gran capacidad de liderazgo, pues, a pesar de su grandeza, siempre comparti el juego con sus compa?eros y supo como dirigirlos, involucrarlos y hacerlos mejores. Esto es algo que no se puede esperar de Kobe Bryant, quien acab por propiciar la salida de Shaq de los Lakers por no querer compartir el show.    En cuanto a logros, no hay punto de comparacin entre Jordan y Bryant. MJ gan seis campeonatos de NBA, seis reconocimientos como MVP de la final, cinco ms como MVP de la temporada regular, dos medallas de oro olmpicas, un reconocimiento al Jugador Defensivo del A?o, diez ttulos como mximo anotador de la temporada, entre otros. No creo que a Kobe le alcancen los a?os que le quedan en activo para superar los ttulos de MJ.    No obstante que considero que Jordan es mejor que Bryant, considero que Kobe, sin duda, lograr ser un inmortal dentro de la NBA y se colar al selecto grupo de jugadores leyenda, como Magic Johnson, Wilt Chamberlain, Larry Bird, Bill Russell,Oscar Robertson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Julius Erving, John Stockton, etc.|`|d6fa1b85edaf46e945ee1a584b282b44aa	Entre Michael Jordan y Kobe Bryant,me parece mejor Michael Jordan.Kobe Bryant es el mejor escolta del mundo,actualmente.|`|NcRjLCQeaa	PUES EL MEJOR DE TODOS LO TIEMPOS ES JORDAN Y NO HAY DUDA QUE BRIANT LE QUIERE COPIAR Y LO EMITA MUY BIEN DESDE COMO COME EL CHICLE HASTA COMO JUEGA JAJAJ  SUERTEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE...|`|cqbFUFjuaa	Pues como preguntas eso Pues sin duda alguna     MICHAEL JORDAN|`|iO7FFHxaaa	Jorda, enormidades|`|2e1b6130efa220333d73d79ddea4a1daaa	Creo que hasta esta de ms la pregunta, JORDAN supera ampliamente a Bryant en todas las estadsticas que puedas encontrar.    Un saludo.|`|vzslQ2dUaa	jordan|`|2wDJmluOaa	Jordan ha sido el mejor jugador de basketball (no solo de la NBA), de los jugadores que apenas empiezan su carrera habra que ver que tanto pueden lograr, pero comparandolo con Kobe queda muuuuy lejos, y esto no quiere decir que Bryant sea malo, pero simplemente no tiene el mismo nivel en todo sentido.   A pesar de que aun esta activo, no creo que el tiempo que le quede jugando pueda igualar estadisticas, titulos, logros y mucho menos generar el fenomeno que fue Jordan (y sigue siendo) fuera de las canchas, el demostraba siempre liderazgo de una forma muy autentica y sencilla. Hay jugadores que tienen una u otra cosa, pero todo eso junto solo en Jordan!!!|`|ZWpY12ybaa	Creo que esa pregunta es un poco rara, ya que ests comparando a un buen jugador de baloncestp (Bryant), con el mejor jugador de baloncesto de todos los tiempos (MJ).|`|0HFdfHPwaa	evidentemente los dos han sido jugadores ecxelentes, jordan con 7 titulos de nba, kobe con menos, pero ambos tienen records individuales y colectivos que los podrian colocar como los mejores, ejemplo kobe es el jugador mas joven en llegar a 20.000 puntos, pero jordan tenia una magia natural que quien sabe como la desarrollo. sin duda jordan fue, es y sera el mejor de todos los tiempos|`|MVnD5nIPaa	En el presente esta Kobe es el mejor sin duda!!!! aunque a muchos  les caiga mal o les duela!!!|`|ynthDodxaa	tu majestad michael jordan...no solo fue un gran jugador sino persona.....en lo personal kobe bryant juega bien pero es algo creidoo|`|JsYgQpyQaa	Por siempre sera el numero 23 de los Toros de Chicago, por sus estadisticas, por su estilo de juego, por ser la peza clave de la dinastia de los toros en los 90's.     Bryant pues si es bueno pero llego a un equipo ya ensamblado para playoffs -a comparacion de jordan que fue el pilar de la reconstruccion de chicago, Y ademas siento que Bryant no tiene ese liderazgo que Jordan tenia y mucho menos esa imagen positiva fuera de las canchas|`|sp7FEUh3aa	pa mi que michael Jordan pues fue uno de los mejores en su epoca, Pero Kobe Bryant apenas esta en la mitad de su carrera en la NBA  y todavia le quedan muchos trucos y aza?as por realizar.    Yo pienzo que kobe compartira un lugar en la historia junto a Michael Jordan....|`|0MIcU886aa	MJ por supuesto!  No solo mejor que Kobe, sino mejor que todos!!|`|N1iUMjlSaa	Michael Jordan, ?acaso hay otro? No existe un jugador en la NBA mejor que Michael, ni historicamente, ni ahora, probablemente en posiciones algunos jugadores puedan ganarle en estadstica pero en conjunto, rebotes, asistencias, puntos, robos, el definitivamente SIGUE SIENDO EL MEJOR.|`|kmnSBj6Waa	ninguno de los dos el mejor es hawquins  de los atlanta en los a?os 80 miralo y despus me desis

3HvGRH5Raa	You gotta be BIG to play center so that might not be that best position. If you are a good ball handler, and is somewhat fast i would play guard/point guard. If you can shout from all over the floor i would play forward.|`|lAMt4uRVaa	I'm 5'7 120 pounds and I'm also 15. I'm a point guard so you would be a gaurd too.
