20090225030215AAKIwtM	News & Events;Current Events	What are your opinions on the death at Michael Barrymore's house?	Personally, I think Stuart Lubbock was a closet homosexual and occasional drug user which his family were clearly unaware of and possibly still in denial of.    The night of the death, Barrymore invited a bunch of people back to his place for a drug fuelled orgy and whilst (willingly) under the influence of class A's and after some pretty sordid sex acts, Lubbock was sadly found dead in the pool. Verdict: Accident.   Your thoughts?   Cheers.

So many times have we been fed with this sad story about how Israel has been "genociding" the palestinian arabs for 60 years! What I can′t understand is the following. In 1947,there were less than 200000 arabs left in ALL parts of Palestine,and Gaza.Other 700000 ran to arab countries.   Now,only in Gaza there live over A MILLION of arabs,and another 1,6 Million live in Israel. How could the "genocided" palestinian arabs grow 13 times in just 60 years,from less than 200000 to 2,6 Millions?   During the WWII,when germans together with arabs were genociding Jews,the Jewish population decreasd from 12 millions to 6 millions in just 7 years.If Israel really "genocided" palestinian arabs,then for 60 yeas there would not be a single palestinian arab left alive.   But the arabs go on existing-and judgng by the photos,look quite fine.At least,undernourished they,evidently,are not.    http://www.hurryupharry.org/2008/09/12/l...     http://www.solomonia.com/blog/archive/20...
