I am doing a science fair project on what types of bags prevent mold the longest and we need to know how or why plastic and paper bags prevent mold (at least to the extent that they do).   Our guess so far is that plastic eliminates more humidity and dust from the air that can cause mold spores to grow. Paper bags do that too only they are not sealable, allowing more moisture in.      Is this even close or is there anything to add?   Thanks so much!

First off I want to save the time of people who are going to try and urge me from staying away from the abandoned mine.  I understand the dangers of unforeseen cliffs and carbon monoxide poisoning.      Anyway I have been in this abandoned mine twice and have ventured in about 80-90 yards.  There is a terrible smell of methane, and that kind of gets tricky with lack of oxygen.      I know that bringing a candle into a mine will let you know if there is a sufficient amount of oxygen.  But this methane filled mine might be explosive with a lit candle.      What do you experienced mine explorers/chemists suggest?

20090205192415AA5UhrI	Science & Mathematics;Physics	A question about Einstein's Theory of Relativity?	According to the Theory of Relativity, if I travel at the speed of light, time slows down. I tried to read Thorne's Black Holes and Time Warps - however, someone never returned it to me. And I have seen shows that try to explain why this happens. I think the best explanation was:      If you look at a clock and travel away from it at the speed of light, the clock would look as if time stood still.       When I hear this, it sounds more like information has yet to update. So time does change but the information never reaches you.       Does anyone have a better explanation?

20090205184634AAnUAgs	Science & Mathematics;Medicine	Would a doctor prescribe me beta-blockers for stage fright?	Hi, everyone.  I'm 22, female, I don't take any prescription meds.  Every time I perform, I love it, but I'm either extra-sensitive to adrenaline or I produce too much of it.  Do you think a doctor (normal family doctor) would prescribe beta-blockers to me for when I'm performing occasionally?  I know that beta-blockers are not FDA approved for performance anxiety, but some doctors do prescribe it for that purpose, I just don't know if I would get rejected/if it's worth a shot asking my doctor.  I'm going to meet her for the first time next month, I haven't had a check-up in years.      I know this sounds weird, but I have legit reasons for needing a prescription for Provigil (I have night shifts in the ER and I might be getting a job that's from 11pm-7am) and I don't want to seem like a druggie by asking for two "big" prescriptions at once from a doctor I just met.

Two large oppositely charged horizontal plates separated by some distance create a uniform strong electric field, E = 10^7 N/C in the area between them. A small neutral metal ball located in between the pates with mass, m  = 50g  falls towards the bottom plate. After colliding with the bottom plate it acquires a positive charge of q = 4 * 10^-8 from the plate (the decrease of the plate’s charge due to this is negligibly small). Right after the collision the ball bounces vertically upward with initial velocity, v = 2 m/s. How high will the ball rise after hitting the bottom plate?
20090205194354AAjQ4WD	Science & Mathematics;Biology	Artificial evolution of house flies. Possible?	Let's say you create a contained environment in which common house-flies reproduce. The artificial environment would be divided in compartments, each with different chemical / physical obstacles limiting access to food.      For example, one compartment may contain a fast rotating device that can strike a housefly, another may contain higher-than-average level of CO2, another may have high / low temperature.      Each compartment would be linked to another one through small tunnels.      Do you think after a few years, the houseflies would slowly develop physical abilities allowing them to access food in the hard-to-reach compartments?      Would certain groups of houseflies remain in one compartment because they are better physically adapted to it's environment?      How many generations of houseflies would it take for such physical traits to appear?

20090205203715AAzEzJ4	Science & Mathematics;Botany	Can a plant survive without leaves?	I recently bought a plant of the Salvia family (Salvia Divinorum)   However, when it was shipped here, it was almost completly dead.   All that is left is the main stem. Less than 2 inches.       Also, it has no nodes on it. Can that little piece survive with no leaves, long enough to produce leaves?      should I cut off the stuff above it, I am not sure that it's dead but i assume so because it is mushy, and not rigid at all.

20090203072218AA5HBs4	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	What is the heaviest element generated by nuclear fusion in the core of the sun?	I know that elements bigger than iron (atomic # 26) are generated only in supernovae.  Presumably iron is made only in really massive stars, not in our sun.  However, I'm reasonably sure that our local star produces at least carbon, and probably something heavier, in at least trace amounts.  I can't just look up the chemical composition of the sun, since atoms of, say, magnesium could have been formed by a star from an earlier generation of stars -- a progenitor of the sun.      So what is the biggest elemental nucleus our sun actually makes, via nuclear fusion?  And am I correct that this happens right at the core?

20090205205938AAWltrn	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Real Analysis question?	Let K: [0,1] x [0,1] -> R be a continuous function such that K(x,y) > 0 and the integral K(x,y) dy   R such that f(x)= g(x) + integral K(x,y) dy      What I have:   I know that we are given 2 functions and that we need to input those into the formula. We want to see the output is closer than the input by a factor of k, but I'm not sure what it is that I should be doing.      To show uniqueness, I say to let g(f(x)) = h(x). Which means we are sending [0,1] -> R to [0,1] -> R, but I don't think that's right...      Thanks in advance!

Two large oppositely charged horizontal plates separated by some distance create a uniform strong electric field E= 10^7 N/C.  A small neutral metal ball located in between the pates with mass of 50g falls towards the bottom plate. After colliding with the bottom plate it acquires a positive charge of q= 4x10^-8 C from the plate (the decrease of the plate’s charge due to this is negligibly small).  Right after the collision the ball bounces vertically upward with an initial velocity of 2 m/s. How high will the ball rise after hitting the bottom plate?

20090205210945AAE7Kyu	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Partitions problem-Combinatorics?	Here it is:      Let Фn denote the set of the partitions of the set {1,2,...,n}. Given a couple partitions u and v in Фn, define u≤v, provided each part of u is contained in a part of v. So, the partition u can be obtained by partitioning the parts of v.      1) Prove that this relation is a partial order on Фn.      2) There is a 1-to-1 correspondence between Фn and the set Λn of all equivalence relations on {1,2,...,n}. What is the partial order on Λn that corresponds to this partial order on Фn?      3) Construct the diagram of (Фn, ≤) for n=1,2,3 and 4.

20060802212643AAuD5sH	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Does this theory have any potential?	No event in the universe can be  instantaneous, everything that's happening in the universe is occuring in transition since:   1. No two events may happen without a transition between them. For example, a car cannot go from 50 mph to 70 mph without accelterating (mathematically, this cannot be graphed normally since the line would have a verticle slope, putting 0 in the denominator)   2. An instant is an unmeasurable quantity of time      Is this bs or is there something to this idea?
