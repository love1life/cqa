hoZxIQkkaa	I am behind you 100% bro. It is Entertainment. These men sacrifice there body's for our entertainment. There is no off season. WWE has such a tough travel grind on the superstars. These are some of the moth athletic men in the world. For all you non wrestling fans just don't even open any question about wresting anymore. I say we report them for abuse. They should not mock something we love.|`|aAihh9msaa	All you say it's true. They actually do get injured. I support the WWE too! I agree with you.|`|PLyhhDFNaa	even in the freedom of our own section we have annoying invaderers bugger of you b@st@rds|`|36B9Cl29aa	I agree with you WWE is scripted all the haters I show them Beyond the mat then they shut up.|`|ww65eXn0aa	that what ive been saying but my friends are watching cartoon and say CRAP like it better than watching men's|`|Ac8QOD7Saa	You are telling the truth.|`|nm16oIc9aa	they say we have no life just because we watch wrestling wow can someone explain to me how that is having no life the show only runs for an hour and a half sheesh wrestling is awesome and if you don't like it simple don't come in the wrestling section if you ask me for you guys just to come on this section and moan and groan about why we watch wrestling its pretty obvious that its you guys who have no life|`|lCzBONU1aa	Why aren't people running around insisting magic shows are fake? <br>  <br>  People might think they were stupid for confusing something that's openly showmanship for supernatural powers.|`|YrHuv1g3aa	Yeah the haters will never stop, they know that its scripted but they have no lifes so they just keep saying its fake. They only do it to wind us up and i just ignore it.|`|ywU3ZpIgaa	Never mind them they are just sad human beings who try to bring people down to make them look cool life off the inernet they probably have no friends so they try act cool on the internet.I agree with you 100%|`|aYnduRsxaa	They only hate to get a reaction, which is exactly what they got from this rant. Stop giving them the satisfaction; they will eventually realize that they're wasting time and go away.|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, I agree with you, big time.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|IzgJpVgBaa	i agree
9dvmMRX4aa	What are you asking? If Anderson Cooper is a pitcher or a catcher? I'm really confused here|`|zj8HLXI3aa	Like referring to homosexual anal intercourse, who receives and who 'pitches'|`|Y27ovMdRaa	No idea what you're talking about.
kqGkYn8Daa	Your bowling action will also play a big part. The best swing bowlers have great wrist position and allow the fingers to roll off the back of the ball. Conditions such as weather will also play a part, over cast weather and humidity will also help the ball swing. But the key is knowing how to control the new ball swinging|`|AA11088802	u got many answers|`|232SYfGHaa	It depends a lot on how you catch a ball. Seperate both your fingers a little bit. Apply more preasure on your middle finger and just hold your index finger for grip. After that, you just have to release the ball softly.|`|O379mWdfaa	It can swing by the position of your fingers on the seam and the direction the seam is facing either to the slips or fine leg... A slight adjustment of the Angle of release can assist in the ball swinging as well.|`|gMmMfgxqaa	It depends a lot on how you catch a ball. Seperate both your fingers a little bit. Apply more preasure on your middle finger and just hold your index finger for grip. After that, you just have to release the ball softly.<br>  <br>      * 14 minutes ago
BgKueDyMaa	Duno about Dirk ? Maybe because he is international . I think Tim Duncan might, He has got a story behind him ? But other than that, I do agree with you. Except I dont think Cp3 and Steve Nash will ? Hard to tell with CP3 cause he is so young and you never know what could happen. But at this rate he is going to the top.|`|PwUTG6lEaa	iverson, shaq, cp3,kobe,lebron,wade|`|fZ38PPgSaa	wheres yao ming? he was the first Asian NBA player to ever be successful|`|6yoQhXsOaa	Why isn't Deron Williams on your list?|`|NzrTgpe4aa	Jason Kidd should be on that list. He brought a team with no future, the NJ Nets, to the top in the east and 2 finals appearances. The team had nothing until he came along. But i agree with Tim Duncan, Kobe, LBJ, and CP3 on the top 50 greatest. Dirk shouldnt be there.|`|AA12393503	I really dont know about Dirk. And also Tim Duncan is definitely a future HOF'er. On the list you are also forgetting Jason Kidd(Close Lock), Yao Ming, Deron Williams, and Chris Bosh. I think if they continue at this rate they should have a great chance of making it.|`|2LGvFQMTaa	you forgot kwame brown
ABoo1doVaa	LSU 3? Why? I would probably swap places of LSU and Alabama. Nebraska is probably a little high, and Iowa and Penn State might be a little higher than you have them. OSU should be 10-15 range.<br>  <br>  I think Utah should be on there at least somewhere, and what has Miami done to earn a ranking?|`|KNTofuxMaa	Bama #12??!!  LSU #3? VT #6<br>  <br>  Have you been paying attention?<br>  <br>  <br>  Norrington...<br>  Auburn won't even be in the top 30. 15th... Obviously, you haven't been paying attention, either. Can't expect much from a Poor Eagle, though.|`|9Zbh8HZxaa	Georgia Bulldogs are better than Va Tech , Ole Miss ,Oregon , and Ohio State . But every thing else looks good I went to L.S.U. so im happy where you placed them ! Bamma is also better than Va Tech, and Ole Miss!|`|z6pdWKa5aa	Pretty good, but I would swap Iowa with Georgia, USC shouldn't be ahead of Oklahoma or Ole Miss, GT needs to be higher, what is Vandy doing there? Also, LSU is more like a 9,10,11 team. TCU and Penn State should be higher, and where is Auburn? But other than that, Superb list. Here is my list:<br>  <br>  1. Oklahoma<br>  2. Florida<br>  3. Texas<br>  4. Penn State<br>  5. Ole Miss<br>  6. Georgia Tech<br>  7. Virginia Tech<br>  8. Oregon<br>  9. LSU<br>  10. TCU<br>  11. Oklahoma State<br>  12. Georgia<br>  13. North Carolina<br>  14.

Are you a ole miss fan #7 really? Top 5 looks good LSU is debatable! Iowa at 14 not happening. Probably should take Maryland out of that 23 spot and put in WVU. Probably should lower UNC hakeem nix is gone! Penn State could be higher oregon not so much georgia tech a lil overrated! but overall not that bad|`|152c68c4f66907d48d1dba9c5df028f7aa	its way to early for me to be able to argue hardly any of that ... but LSU at #3 cant complain
xrhnDShgaa	Is it a head to head points league or head to head roto league? Also is this a free or money league?
4owr19vCaa	Pellgun oil is a blend of 20-weight motor oil and an o-ring preservative, and works well with the AirMag C11 as well as other Co2 air pistols including the .177/4.5mm types.  Use a drop of it on every 2nd or 3rd Co2 cartridge and your AirMag C11 will last for years.<br>  <br>  DO NOT use airsoft lube on the Co2 cartridge, it is too thin and causes leaks.  It is a very common misconception for airsoft veterans to do this, and ruin the seals in the Co2 mechanism - and it gets a bad reputation as a result.<br>  <br>  You can use airsoft lube on the BB feeding and trigger mechanism, and the inner barrel it works very well.<br>  <br>  I agree that you can't use colman propane in a Co2 replica and Wal-mart has you covered for the cheapest 2-mag pack, the cheapest laser attachment and the cheapest ammo (that works well in many non-tightbore airsoft replicas)<br>  <br>  C11 mag 2-pack  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=9222891" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>  <br>  Crosman Laser Sight  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=10248637" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>  <br>  Crosman .2g ammo 5k count  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=9222912" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>  <br>  Pellgun oil  <a href="http://www.pyramydair.com/cgi-bin/accessory.pl?accessory_id=222" rel="nofollow">http://www.pyramydair.com/cgi-bin/access...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  cheers|`|HAH7ILrSaa	I looked at a local walmart and they sell 2 clips for $11<br>  <br>  but for quality lasers, you need to buy online.<br>  <br>  the crosman pellgunoil helps seals the o -rings in your gun so CO2 won't leak. but they are usually for pellet guns (.177 cal)<br>  <br>  for airsoft you use only %100 Silicone oil to lube your gun.<br>  <br>  No you can't use coleman fuel because your airsoft gun is CO2 powered no  not green gas powered.<br>  <br>  People use Coleman fuel as an alternate gas for their green gas guns because its cheaper to buy the propane and green gas aren't usually available and %90 more expensive
0fb4ce4da0f3875154ab271a088412fcaa	Yes, I do it on all sports games. I never save them because it's fun to make a new player every time. One time I made one with literally my exact self with height, weight, position, and everything, then I put myself on the Spurs went into a Franchise and played a whole season. On Madden I do it all the time and make myself super fast lol.|`|AA12393503	Its too easy when i create my player because my player is just too nice. I like starting out with a wack franchise and remodel them to be good. It takes about 2 seasons but it makes it that much better because the games are more intense and close, and it also makes me better.|`|BgKueDyMaa	Haha hell yes, Everyone does and chucks there stats up bigtime and wins every season getting mvp and winning dunk comps..<br>  I do it on live though.|`|F1xpcJ2Laa	I created my self in NBA Ballers...I was like 7'0 ft tall with crazy handles and shooting about 90% from the 3 point line|`|5FypDafWaa	Yes Sir|`|yrBa2BNvaa	im 6-7 on the lakers playing SF. 30 ppg 7 rpg 6 apg|`|A71U6gNtaa	yeah 28PPG 6RPG 4APG - PF of THUNDER|`|WK3Kx4Mkaa	yea i always i pla shooting so i made my guy that and average 41|`|Ho3QKuDBaa	Yes i was pg-sg 5"7 on the miami heat.

wMh38OzVaa	No they should be on the WGN channel out of Chicago.I think it would do better there.|`|YrHuv1g3aa	They should go back to CW.|`|8h5dqzf6aa	they should go to usa if they will the ratings will get bigger|`|36B9Cl29aa	I agree why not on USA. I mean RAW hits like 4.0 on USA|`|85aWKsptaa	NO|`|OHBvEYKHaa	they should go to cw again not alot of people have my network tv|`|Ac8QOD7Saa	No, Smackdown is going through a transitional period.  Plus, it was put on local tv for the economically disadvantaged, so they can have a chance to embrace WWE.  It is no different than Saturday Night Live Event being on NBC only problem is MYTV does not compare to NBC.  I think maybe a Fox move will help increase the ratings or wait till MYTV boosts it creditability for more carries to hold it.|`|PLyhhDFNaa	the should go to usa so they are on the same network as raw
cPjX0dHIaa	Yeah. He's a Steelers legend! My dad used to work with him. He is pretty cool. He has 4 superbowl rings. He was the Steeler's old safety. He retired and Troy Polomalu took his place. I have like 4 autographed pics.
lTeXIjpOaa	i'm sure there are at least a few people joining the track team to get in shape/that are new to it; your school may offer conditioning for track before the season starts; if the coach thinks that you should go out for the team, i would definately take his advice, it is a fun sport to be involved in|`|9d8k5hBfaa	You probably have a little bit of time before track starts, so after school run at the track or around the neighborhood to get in better shape incase you do decide to join. You may find it comforting once you start, or you may just automatically decide running is not for you. If you do enjoy it and think that you have some potential, definately join. Besides, if you hate it you can always tell the coach that you have decided to stop. Good luck :)|`|1NtC3SG0aa	yeah of course!! even if you arnt the best its still really fun and you dont know if your good at it until you try it, even if ur not good at running u could go for the field events!!<br>  personally im a sprinter and we hav practice the whole year (and yes that includes over the summer ^_^.. yeah its lots of fun until coach starts making us do ladders) and u start bonding with everyone real well and stuff<br>  you might make friends!! and it will help with ur running and endurance|`|YWeCIru5aa	I don't run track, my sister does. But if you enjoy running, then you should try it out. (My sister isn't all too good at running either, but she stilled join)<br>  <br>  It will also get you in shape. Along with that, it'll look good on your college applications too.<br>  <br>  (: Hoped I helped.|`|22cCdb0Kaa	Ask to practise with the team and then join after a few practises and improve and build your confidence<br>  <br>  Once u start running with the team you'll probably start slow but will get the hang of it|`|xh2AlJsiaa	do it! join<br>  other people are worse<br>  i guarantee it
dDhTMacAaa	Sure, break up the chemistry.<br>  <br>  Vujajic spreads the floor and Walton, while "fans" think he does nothing, is a hustler and a good player and defender.<br>  <br>  Shannon Brown and Adam Morrison have no experience and probably won't do much for the team this season, while Ariza is better off the bench.|`|yrBa2BNvaa	morrison shouldnt even be on a team. he should be on the inactive list|`|44G7farEaa	When the Lakers go up against an elite Shooting Guard, then Give Shannon some lockdown minutes, other than that don't fix what isn't broken...|`|BgKueDyMaa	That asian 6'8 point gaurd would be a better starter than luke.. Get him out of there. They would be better off trading him for $20.|`|2LGvFQMTaa	luke is only starting because his daddy is billy walton<br>  <br>  they shoulda kept turiaf instead of sasha.<br>  <br>  isnt morrison the guy that had diabetes or something. hes like damaged goods.<br>  <br>  and its seems all the lakers trades are lopsided:<br>  gasol for nothing<br>  overpriced raddy for 2 young studs<br>  unoaded mihms contract for free<br>  <br>  its a conspiracy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...
kGCd8ioRaa	Why is the Undertaker's title so short too - storyline purposes I guess|`|EUdHcGW1aa	Maybe if he was married to Vince's daughter instead of HHH, he probably would have longer title reigns.|`|PLyhhDFNaa	most people have really short reigns with only one or two defenses, exceptions to this are the golden children hhh and cena|`|FxvOEYtaaa	He sucks! That pretty much sums it up..|`|36B9Cl29aa	Agreed but he has won many titles so I doubt he cares

Are you sure you have the right channel?
ptQ5SkPVaa	The first guy is right, like it or not they draw ratings. Until MVP can draw ratings like that then he won't be in the title picture.<br>  I like MVP, and he should get pushed more but he can't sell products like Cena.|`|B9h6VhQOaa	lol where have you been for the last 3 years? :)|`|6d0250ca8941e47460eda0499a69b2caaa	TRIPLE H is my main man and Cena i like him ok.|`|PLyhhDFNaa	they are always in the title picture because they draw ratings|`|36B9Cl29aa	Yeah
EwIR2Ivoaa	They don't have to franchise anyone.  The franchise tag is a way of holding onto a player if the team can't reach an agreement on a multiyear deal.  If the Raiders already reached deals with those two players, they may not have anyone else they are all that concerned about at this point.|`|rjuqrHK7aa	The deadline already passed. They didn't tag anyone.|`|MMi4V5imaa	Asomugha
ABoo1doVaa	Maybe you shouldn't have been so quick to fire a national championship caliber coach.|`|7SCOqUa8aa	give him a little time.. last year was his first year, you have to at least give a coach 3 years so he can get his own recruits in and then judge him.. recruiting is where it all starts and their recent recruiting classes under shannon have been outstanding.. they have a couple of good running backs along with a talented young qb.. the pieces are coming into place for miami to contend for an acc title..|`|Mi3rHjcYaa	You're right Shannon needs to go, I remember about 5-10 years ago when Miami really knew how to recruit, they had guys like:<br>  <br>  Warren Sapp<br>  Ray Lewis<br>  Ed Reed<br>  Sean Taylor<br>  Jonathan Vilma<br>  Jeremy Shockey<br>  Kellen Winslow Jr.<br>  Clinton Portis<br>  Willis McGahee<br>  Andre Johnson<br>  Reggie Wayne<br>  Devin Hester<br>  <br>  etc, etc.<br>  <br>  They need to bring a coach who knows how to recruit.|`|1Weqg1G8aa	UNC was a good team this year as was Georgia Tech the other 2 not so much. Randy shannon with pan out and be a elite coach recruiting is there and talent will be there he's very smart and knows what he's doing give him this year and you'll see a difference.|`|195d481e791fe6dd37323b342df9fa94aa	ur crazy<br>  the canes are improving, shannon is rebuilding <br>  he wasnt the coach when the team fell<br>  every year we are gettin better<br>  besides the ACC is the most balanced mediocre conference|`|Evu9Eq06aa	The Canes suck any Way|`|SLPbJO3kaa	He should have been gone a long time ago.  Not because of his success (or lack there of) but he is very arrogant.  He is going to lose a lot of recruits over this Robert Marve deal.<br>  <br>  Agreed, Larry Coker, did nothing wrong and they threw him under the bus.
9UhoUcM2aa	Iverrrrson|`|reIMLCKkaa	Iverson use to lead Philly to the playoffs alone, While Pierce would be sitting home. Iverson can take over a game and pound for pound is one of the greatest players of alltime, He is only 5'10 and would smoke Pierce one on one|`|dDhTMacAaa	Allen Iverson.<br>  <br>  Why? Because he is a legend and a gifted scorer.<br>  <br>  Who would I want on my team right now, though  - Paul Pierce.|`|WK3Kx4Mkaa	Iverson more experience and would beat peirce one on one with his handles|`|2LGvFQMTaa	this is a stupid question<br>  <br>  if you dont know the obvious answer then you dont know basketball|`|yrBa2BNvaa	iverson cuz he went to the finals with a team that sucked. paul pierce needed 2 more all stars|`|BgKueDyMaa	Compare Iverson in 76ers and Pierce without the big 3..

Evu9Eq06aa	Im a Giants fan but im going to say The Steelers because of the way the owner is loyal to his coaches and how they stick to the same philosophy (strong defense) all these years. <br>  <br>  I think the most TALENTED player and who could have been the best was Barry Sanders (kind of feel sorry for him). But the best player is Jim Brown or Lawrence Taylor (imagine Jim Brown running towards Lawrence Taylor trying to tackle him - wonder who would win that battle).|`|uU15o7Mbaa	The best team would be the Green Bay Packers and the best player of all time I would have to say Barry Sanders the things that he accomplished despite not having the luxuries like a good o-line that most other running backs had was astounding he would make plays out of nothing|`|wEYIYevKaa	THE MICHIGAN WOLVERINES!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|E8vG5bsPaa	Green Bay PAckers.

poQmOZb1aa	Rumor has it that when Stephanie was a teenager and Savage was going thru his divorce with Elizabeth, young Stephanie was quiet smitten with a much older Randy.  <br>  <br>  Assuming that Vince is like any father, he would not want his teen daughter with a man who was 24 yrs older.  Not sure whether anything had happened between them....|`|PLyhhDFNaa	vince dont like savage cause savage is to good for wwe|`|q06g4hHKaa	Idk, but Savage was awsome, shame he isn't in the new wrestlemania game.|`|WiIUEObTaa	randy was a disruptive force in the wwe. suffered panic attacks, turned on hogan, major mistake. paranoia regarding Elizabeth. was control freak over matches. great performer. wwe could not handle his antics . and freak outs. deserves hall of fame. will not receive it. what hogan wanted , hogan got.
gXHxf2G9aa	I think she's doing an excellent job.....She has herself at a point in the WWE now that she's a serious contender in the ring and both the fans and other diva's know that so she's viewed as a greater threat.<br>  <br>  The only thing I can't understand is why the WWE writers teamed her up with her number one rival Maryse this past week on Smackdown!?<br>  <br>  I thought they hated each other.  I realise that it's all scripted but I just seems a bit weird that the once greatest enemies on Smackdown are now tag team partners???  If they writers had any sense they would have built up to the alliance between the two rival rather than just "put" them together...|`|ywU3ZpIgaa	yes she also shows a lot more attitude than when she was a face when she cut promos when she was a face she was like a robot talking she is doing a great job as a heel right now|`|S0u3HKzhaa	Yes very,she is a very good heel I think.Actually I think she does a better heel then face.She just has something about her that can really work the role of the heel.|`|8h5dqzf6aa	yeah she is doing a great job as a heel|`|OHBvEYKHaa	yeah but she could do something else other than snap on face divas|`|AA11667316	I've always thought that Michelle was a b#%^h.  Never found anything sincere in her playing a face, so I love having her as a heel.|`|qR99SYPXaa	i agree she does, i think she should wrestle at mania|`|lGIL36faaa	exactly....she does doesn't she? i agree with u.she is so good at it and i think being a heel suits her|`|bGAv6Gjpaa	NO WAY!
PLyhhDFNaa	no hhh doesnt need anyone to back him up he has enough pull on his own|`|AA11667316	HHH was one of the most powerful men in wrestling back when he was doing Chyna.  He and Steph came much later.<br>  <br>  Edge, from what very little I know, is an *** in real life.  He published an autobiography talking about how much he loved his wife about the same time the news of he and Lita broke.  Drives me a little nuts.  Fortunately, he is on helluva entertainer and makes us all "happy".|`|aJ7v8zuFaa	No... Edge wins so many titles because the fans react well to Edge cheating to win championships and then losing them to the Faces.<br>  HHH wins so many championships because Stephanie gets tired of listening to him ***** when he doesnt have one...

I wouldn't find it funny if it was anyone... because thats really immature to say someone is gay when they really aren't.. also its even more immature to make a youtube video about it.. that person has NO life.

VefSnu0Gaa	it's pretty safe to say he'll get to the final, i mean sela shouldn't be hard at all (i mean that quarter match was like from another tournament)<br>  in the final hopefully he'll be against our andy, and let's hope andy can get revenge for last week.-<br>  keep your fingers crossed :D|`|u3FqxhY8aa	I don't really like Radek and I sure won't be cheering for him against any of his opponents, but I have to hand it to him he has been playing really well lately.  He shouldn't have a problem in the semis and supposing that he plays Andy in the finals I doubt he will have much of a problem with him either so maybe I could see a third title for him.......ugh I kinda wish he would just retire already.  I hope Roddick beats him in the finals though.|`|87BjduXvaa	No i don't like Stepanek, Brisbane was a fluke.<br>  <br>  He beat both Gasquet and Verdasco by playing mental games<br>  with them. He is rude and i was a ballkid in that match and as<br>  gasquet would hit the shot he would make some kind of noise<br>  <br>  hes a dirty player + i dont think he will. Once the other players<br>  find their rhythm he will lose it.

But it's not a problem for him because he scores and he performs beautifully compared to the overrated others.<br>  <br>  The most astounding performer I saw was the magical Michael J when he opens his tongue and scores and scores consistently.

They booed him because of last year's game one playoff matchup where time duncan hit that three near the buzzer. Spurs ultimately won the game and many suns players/fans said if spurs didnt steal that game, suns would have advanced.|`|a7AatQcEaa	Probably because earlier in the year the spurs sg roger mason shot the game winner vs the suns at home. Since the All Star game is in Pheonix Tim Duncan would obviously get booed.|`|UUMARzy1aa	phoenix hates anyone on the spurs. its because what happened on Christmas when the spurs beat them by a buzzer beater.

In PHO the Spurs are known to be a dirty team|`|AA10744471	It was because of sheer frustration of the Phoenix Suns fans over the good performance of Tim Duncan and the rest of the Spurs by beating the Suns in their home territory and so the Spurs are the pet peeves of the Suns fans. It was not really a bad boo but a recognition of their frustration of the Spurs winning ways against their team, the Suns. This is just all for the hoopla and showbiz of the All Star Game. Remember how the fans lapped up the dance of the giant Shaq? All sound and fury signifying nothing but showbiz.|`|RvI1gGbDaa	He got booed because the Spurs keep beating the Suns in the playoffs ('03, '05, '07, '08). Kobe got booed at the 2002 NBA All-Star game (which was in Philly) because the Lakers beat the 76ers in the Finals the year before.|`|Lxj6kMklaa	Phoenix Suns hate the Spurs because the Spurs always upset the Suns by beating them in very close games every time they play each other|`|t1uKdzmLaa	My guess is because he is from the Spurs; they pulled an upset win in Phoenix by barely beating the Suns earlier this season. The fans must have been really pissed by how that game ended.

nxymxSUFaa	Talk about not being objective, that would be you!  You forgot to mention that Magic won 5 championships.  One of which he won single handed when Kareem was out of the line up.  Those loses you talk about were against a truly great 76er's team and an equally great Boston team.<br>  <br>  Magic was a play maker, not a ball hog like Kobe.  Magic played during perhaps the greatest overall talented era in NBA history.  Jordan came alone right after that era ended.  <br>  <br>  Today's NBA game is no where near the caliber of basketball that it was in the 70's and 80's.  Teams were much better and if you look at the scoring stats from that era you will find that players played better defense and shot more accurately.<br>  <br>  Your argument is all wet.  Kobe is a great player by today's standards but he never played against the likes of a Julius Erving or a Larry Bird.<br>  <br>  If you really knew your basketball you would know that "Pistol" Pete Maravich was, by far, the greatest passer who ever lived and probably the greatest ball handler as well.  Ever hear of him?  Didn't think so!<br>  <br>  Have a nice day.|`|3teWTOPqaa	No, Magic could have been GOAT if he played longer, he retired in his prime years and the Showtime Lakers were dominating at the time.|`|BiMkowVMaa	Wow... you might get a lot of Laker fans going against each other on this one.<br>  <br>  But it is Magic.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Don Imus? MmmmHmmm... okay... I think MC is right. Your a Faker... not a Laker.|`|reIMLCKkaa	Are you crazy. Magic the original MJ was amazing, he was forced to retire young or would have passed soo many more records if he played until he was ready to go.

He also went to college and started 4 years older than Kobe at which point he Carried us to a ring as a rookie jumping C for an injured Kareem|`|NG6eeCfuaa	God no. Magic revolutionized the point guard position for gods sake you dumb kid. I'm not even going to answer this with actual facts as you deserve none.

ATTACK!<br>  <br>  and you're wrong|`|oMSTg5rQaa	LMAO, read what you just typed, ok, please...<br>  <br>  Magic lost 4 times in the Finals right? But he took the Lakers to the Finals 9 times in his 12 year career! The only people who have won more as the center piece of a dynasty are Michael Jordan and Bill Russell.<br>  <br>  Also, Kobe while I really enjoy watchin' Kobe when he's playing the right, I have to say HE, not Magic is the one who's over rated.<br>  <br>  Kobe will drop 60 on the grizz, 81 on the Raptors, 61 on the no defense Knicks and look spectacular. But in the playoffs he melts down against anything that resmbles a good defense.<br>  <br>  Kobe is a regular season superstar but he is a post season burnout.|`|9UhoUcM2aa	Kobe Bryant is simply the Best<br>  You know he's better than all the rest<br>  he makes shots that look like they could never be done<br>  and to him, its just playing for fun<br>  When KB's on the court..you never know whats going to happen..<br>  alll these players better start adaptin'<br>  He's the best of all time<br>  if anyone says otherwise its a crime<br>  you better start doin the samba <br>  cuz here comes Kobe- THE BLACK MAMBA<br>  <br>  <br>  hahah thank you thank you<br>  <br>  =)<br>  <br>  i had to make that up for a question earlier.. <br>  just thought I'd share lol|`|BgKueDyMaa	Magic was the rock of his team..

Yuvraj, Ghambhir, Sehwag, Raina, Yousuf Pathan are just some. All these players can hit the ball out of the ground and are really effective against quality bowling attacks.<br>  <br>  South Africa: Obvious choice Albie 'Powerplay' Morkel.

But i feel that Gambhir is a bit more consistent and practices controlled aggresion.<br>  <br>  Pakistan: I agree with you on this one. Shahid Afridi. He would've been more dangerous if he was more consistent.<br>  <br>  England: No doubt about this: Kevin Pietersen- why do you think he was auctioned in the IPL for such a large sum?<br>  <br>  Australia: I feel that Michael Hussey has a dangerous combination between his aggression, and defense. He performs however his team needs him to perform, and in the end proves to be extremely consistent. <br>  <br>  South Africa: Has to be Graeme Smith. As a matter of fact, if my memory serves me right there was an article where Ponting stated that Graeme Smith would be their biggest fear. (and in the recent series we see why)<br>  <br>  West Indies: Chris Gayle. He has the perfect combination of aggression and consistency. Although he seems to be aggressive, he is also extremely consistent, making him dangerous. <br>  <br>  New Zealand: Opposed to many popular belief, I think that Brendan McCullum is extremely dangerous. He can be extremely aggressive when his team needs it, and, in my opinion, he has the best pull shot that i've ever seen from any player.

AA12393503	North Carolina will lose in he Elite 8 or Final 4..i dnt got them winning it. I think Louisville or Oklahoma. Hansborough deserves recognition, Harangody could be but his team is not playing to their potential. Dejuan Blair has anchored his team and Seth Curry also, so there are a couple of candidates but u cant pinpoint the 2nd best player. Blake Griffin as definitely separated from the bunch.|`|dDhTMacAaa	Besides Blake Griffin, I say Tyler Hansborough. Mainly the experience + talent.<br>  <br>  I think North Carolina will win it.|`|v5MP0KJ8aa	Being a tarheel fan, it would be hard to give you an unbiased opinion so i'm not. The way UNC is playing on offense (Ty Lawson especially), they won't need defense to win. They can give up 80 points if they're scoring 90. Lawson is shooting almost 50% from 3 and Green and Ellington are around 40%. Hansbrough will give you 20 points and 10 rebounds on any given night and Thompson is capable of a big game also. Not to mention, Zeller is back in the rotation so that's more offense and a potential shot blocker on defense. As far as the second best player, there are a lot of guys with big game potential but lack consistency. For that reason I think Tyler Hansbrough is the second best player in the country (21.4 ppg 7.5 reb). You could also make and argument for Luke Harangody (24.4 ppg 12.7 reb).He has better numbers than Hansbrough but his team isn't as loaded. He has to score. Hansbrough's getting those numbers with a team full of superstars.|`|NWXBqftkaa	University OF North Carolina. They have been playing great with ten in a row in conference after dropping their first two. Lawson has been playing great. Ellington has generally been shooting well. Green has been doing this usual thing. Thompson can score if he chooses to it seems like. And Hansbrough will bring it every night. Ed Davis is a good bench player who comes in with immediate defense and rebounding. Not to mention that Tyler Zeller, a 7 footer who broke his wrist real early in the season who was suspected to be out for the whole season returned last wednesday for eight minutes. That just deepens the depth at the 4 and 5.<br>  <br>  DeJuan Blair from Pitt has been a beast this year. Hansbrough continues to play well, but not best player in the country well.|`|4XVRlnNIaa	UNC best all around team<br>  Harengody
WiIUEObTaa	join the army after your pro sport career please. your times on sand are world class the pros in sports slower . use caution when running with the vest. no more than quarter mile. increase weekly. sand plus vest. hard on knees. ankles. go slow. sign m l b or nfl. your times are t6hat great. not good great.|`|lTeXIjpOaa	i would try short runs with the vest at first, see how they go, how it feels afterwards, then work your way up to your two mile run; running on the sand adds difficulty too, as you will sink deeper in the sand weighing more, you don't want to overdue it|`|eaagpElnaa	You have a pretty good time there. However Im failing to see why you would need a weughted vest unless its required by for example you work (like the police force).<br>  Otherwise I disagree about running with weights, in that it prohibits natural body movement. Wearing a weighted vest may for example cause you to stay 'down longer' while running.<br>  I suggest do proper weight training at a gym to help with your strength

Like back then a level 5 would be what a level 6 or 7 would be now!|`|uKyfRzxIaa	It was easier then because every year of the olympics they chage the routines (If you're with USA Gym) and usually they are harder, so it gradually progresses.

I really think they was just lucky in the finals. Dallas should've won. Detroit should've beat them also. I don`t even think they will make it to the finals, they got some real good comeptition over in the east now, The bulls for example, they played the best against the heat in the playoffs, now they are even better thanks to Ben Wallace. My pick to win it all next year, is none other but The San Antonio Spurs. They have a thing for losing in the semi-finals then coming back to win it all. 3-0 When going to the finals.<br>  <br>  Spurs V.S Detroit '07 Finals..|`|83fdd373610c85c9dcaf5b4c18626559aa	Miami who?

Then you have to practice it and make it perfect for you.|`|95251b09a9ad66da899e0ee75139fbe3aa	Oops!  I sent you a reply the first time, thinking you were asking about shooting a rifle.  Sorry!

Once your stronger, your shot will be more comfortable.|`|AA11258819	BEEF (Balance, Eyes. Elbow, Followthrough)|`|38884d349b9481e2cc08f324197bca7aaa	If you have to alter your form to shoot farther out it means your not within your shooting range.  If you want to keep regular form you should lift wieghts, obviously to increase strength, and eventually, depending on your lifting program, you'll be able to shoot from distance with your original form.  And shooting form varies from one person to the next.  I had radio announcers and coaches telling me how perfect and textbook my form was.  Now that I'm going to be playing college ball I have to drastically change my form because it my old release was to slow.  My best advice to you is to simply just shoot the ball.  When you keep worrying about form your shot well start to get messed up.

Recuerdo que cuando las eliminatorias a Corea Japon, Mexico ya se estaba quedando afuera, y un locutor de Radio aqui en los Angeles dijo: Mexico tiene que ir al Mundial porque Televisa la mas grande televisora Mexicana invirtio muchos millones de Dollares y no los puede perder. Yo se que muchos se molestaran po esto que digo, pero es la realidad. Mexico no es ninguna potencia economica, Mas de 20,000,000 de Mexicanos se vinieron para aca a USA porque la situacion economica es terrible; pero sin embargo loa futbolistas Mexicanos ganan mejor que todos los fubolistas de cualquier pais de Latino America y Europa.Hace algunos anos atras un Futbolista Colombiano que jugaba en Mexico fue detenido en la Aduana con 2,000,000 de Dollares en efectivo y cuando las autoridades antinarcoticos de USA lo interrogaron y le preguntaron cual era su centro de opersciones dijo: La Federacion Mexicana de Futbol. Por eso vemos como los equipos Mexicanos sobresalen y tambien la Seleccion, no porque jueguen bien sino porque detras de todo esto esta la corrupcion. Lo unico que no logro entender es como se les fue de la mano el triunfo de la sub 17 es posible que esta ves no le llegaron al precio a los Directivos corruptos de las Federaciones de Football de Centro America y del Caribe.<br>  Mexico no sirve, los que lo hacen grande son la prensa y la television porque viven de la ignorancia de muchos que creen en sus mentiras, Porque es increible los miles de millones de dollares que se manejan en el fooball mexicano, y todos tienen su parte: prensa y televicion directivos y duenos de equipos.|`|535a6103240f0bd6be8096d0f4281b1daa	...es para darles palizas a los equipuchos venezolanos<br>  jaaaaaaaaa|`|57d935d67dc458acbe4d4b7dc2d5d1beaa	para empezar no se llaman chivas<br>  se llama GUADALAJARA otra cosa es que nos hayan puesto ese apodo los atlistas.<br>  SAN LUIS es nombre de localidad<br>  y no...

cdd053c7267a9295fa7eb28ff1648796aa	Basic Techniques For Training The High School Quarterback<br>  The most important techniques a high school quarterback needs to master can be practiced during the off-season. Repetition is the key to becoming a good quarterback. Throwing the football five hundred times a day will certainly enable a youngster to become better. There is no substitute for the "want to" attitude and the quarterback must have this type of determination in order to succeed.<br>  <br>  1. Stance<br>  <br>  The first thing we do in teaching technique is to work on stance. A quarterback must "look good" and we teach this technique from the toes all the way to the head. The feet must be comfortably spread, as wide as the shoulders. We stress that the feet be toe to toe and not staggered. The knees should be bent comfortably and not strained. Hips should be dropped to a comfortable position (in relation to the center) and remain as tall as your center permits. The arms and shoulders are bent slightly at the head and eyes looking ahead or from side to side.<br>  <br>  In other words, we want our quarterbacks to be able to read defenses right now. Tell your quarterback to be relaxed and to reflect a confident attitude. Don't hurry the play. Ask him to think about this position and to actually see himself in it. We tell our quarterbacks that they become what they think about. The mental attitude of your quarterback is very important. Throughout the training period, we talk about this mental characteristic as much as the physical aspect.<br>  <br>  2. Hand Position<br>  <br>  The hand position is the next thing we work on. The upper hand should have the palm parallel to the ground. The arm of the upper hand must be slightly bent; index finger fully extended; spread fingers so they are strong and not tense. Press up firmly on the center's crotch. You receive the ball with this hand. The index finger's second knuckle should be placed on the "brown spot". Doing this will enable the quarterback to receive the football properly. This position of the index finger will not strain the quarterback's shoulders.<br>  <br>  You want your quarterback to be comfortable. The arms are slightly bent at the elbows. This is important so that when the ball is snapped, the arms extend and follow the center as he charges forward. We work hard on this because the execution of the center-quarterback exchange is vital. We never take this exchange for granted.<br>  <br>  In fact, a good coach will demand that this be done every day and insist that it be done right all the time. The lower hand's thumb position (tip of the thumb) should be next to the knuckle of the upper hand. The wrists should be together. The lower hand's fingers are spread in order to trap the ball. As it is snapped, the ball should be stacked up against the palm of the upper hand. Both hands and the arm must follow the center. In other words, give with the center as you receive the ball.<br>  <br>  3. Carrying the Football<br>  <br>  The next thing that is important for a good quarterback to master is carrying the football. He must bring the ball to his belt buckle (stomach area) after the snap. He must keep his elbows close to his sides and mentally start to get ready to hand off, toss the ball, or bring it to a throwing position. Good quarterbacks always operate from this position.<br>  <br>  4. Handing the Ball Off<br>  <br>  Handing the ball off is the next fundamental we teach. It requires discipline and concentration regardless of the type of hand off you are executing at the time (i-formation; the veer; dive; sweep; toss). We tell our quarterbacks to "let your eyes control your feet." In other words, your eyes will control the length of your steps.<br>  <br>  It is the quarterback's responsibility to give the ball to the ball carrier. He is a "dealer" and must have both hands on the ball in order to hand off correctly. On veer plays or dives the exchange comes with the same foot as the give hand (going to the right, it will be left foot, left hand; to the left, it will be right foot, right hand). This allows for greater reach and balance. You want this technique to be a natural movement. Simply look and concentrate on your target and place the ball into the running back's pocket. Avoid slamming.<br>  <br>  5. The Passing Technique<br>  <br>  The passing techniques are next. Grasping and holding the ball is very important before the actual throwing takes place. We want our quarterback to cradle the ball at arm level - over the right breast area. After the snap, you bring the ball to your belt buckle and work it to this right breast area as you position yourself to throw (drop back or sprint action). As you bring the football to this position, adjust the laces to your throwing hand. You must hold the ball with your fingertips and allow an air pocket between the ball and the palm your hind. The fingertip control of the football is essential for good passers. The elbows should be in at the sides allowing the ball to be away from your chest (several inches, at least). Relax! You are now in the proper position to release the football.<br>  <br>  Tell your quarterback to separate the ball from his left hand. The lower end of the football points backwards as you separate. This allows him to bring his elbow up over the top of his shoulder pad. Just tell him to get rid of his left hand naturally and to work above his shoulders. Make sure that he doesn't lower the football too much below his breast area. As he comes back to the throwing motion, he rotates his shoulders at the same time. The palm of the hand, the front toe of the lead foot, shoulders and hips will all face the target as he releases the football. Work for a smooth rhythm and snap your wrist as you throw and release the ball over the shoulders.<br>  <br>  Note: demand that your quarterback throws with a purpose. Make sure that he uses a target above the receiver's shoulders. Make it a challenge to see how many times the receiver catches the ball above his shoulders. Playing catch properly is important in developing accuracy when throwing a football.<br>  <br>  Releasing the football quickly requires intensity. We tell our quarterback to "short stroke" the football and roll your shoulders quickly. Remember that the tip of the index finger is the last thing that touches the football. Turn your hand and thumb down and out a little as you release the ball. Follow through by driving your chin past the front foot. There should be air below the back heel of your back leg as you follow through.<br>  <br>  One thing that helps our quarterback with this follow through is to use the "imaginary line" principal, particularly to help develop accuracy. An "imaginary line" is one that extends from you to the target. The left foot should land on the left side of this line and the right foot on the right. The body will be squared up properly if this is done. Drop your throwing hand naturally as you release the ball - usually this hand will end up somewhere around the inside of the lead leg as you complete the throwing action.<br>  <br>  6. Footwork<br>  <br>  Footwork is essential in completing the proper passing technique. Upon reaching the set position in throwing, the quarterback will close his feet (gathered) so that they will be under him. This will prevent over-striding. Tell him to keep his feet moving and be in a coiled position (knees bent slightly) ready to uncoil.<br>  <br>  Note: allow the quarterback to take a hitch step if time allows. There is more accuracy to a football that's thrown this way. Don't lock your knees because the ball will travel nose down when thrown. Be flexible and relax.<br>  <br>  7. Quick Release<br>  <br>  Developing the quick release is the most difficult technique to teach. Everything must be put together now. Pointing the ball backwards; rolling the shoulders; concentrating on the target (not the flight of the ball; feet; snapping your wrist; the follow through; etc.)<br>  <br>  8. Drop Back TechniqueThe most popular type of pass is the drop back technique. Timing and being able to recognize coverages are important after you have mastered the basic fundamentals. Whether you use a 3, 5, 7 or deeper type of drop back pass, the most important thing is to set up as quickly as you can and keep your feet under you. Taking five short quick steps with your feet under you can be more effective than taking three long steps.<br>  <br>  Good balance is a necessity to perform well when throwing. There is better mobility and control with the quick short steps as compared to the long. Allow your quarterback to do what he is best it. Basically, you want to keep your head down field as you drop back. You want your quarterback to be able to see the width of the field (53 1/3 yards). This is a must to be able to throw good drop back patterns.<br>  <br>  Setting up to throw quickly must be worked on every day. You cannot simply go through the motions in practice. Drop your tail a little as you begin movement and gain momentum from the snap of the ball. Push off your anchor foot and reach back 130 degrees and keep your eyes down field. Sprint back to your desired depth as fast as you can. In the last two steps of the drop back, start to shift your weight forward. There are other types of techniques used - some quarterbacks use the "back peddle", combination steps, roll out, sprint out, or play action.<br>  <br>  9. Play Action Pass<br>  <br>  The play action pass is probably the most popular style used today. In the play action pass, you must first sell the run. The more you freeze the secondary (linebackers, especially) the better the completion percentage. In the play action pass, the quarterback hides the ball until the last possible instant.<br>  <br>  10. Pitch Technique<br>  <br>  One way in which we try to determine the best quarterback is to teach the pitch technique. This technique requires good athletes. The option play is one of the most difficult to defend against. We tell our quarterbacks to drive the thumb through the football and aim for the numbers of the back receiving the ball. Although we don't use the option play, we still teach it for our quarterbacks to know.<br>  <br>  11. Intangibles of Quarterbacking<br>  <br>  It is difficult to describe on paper the techniques a quarterback must develop. However, I have tried to explain the basic techniques a coach must know in order to help his quarterback be the best he can be. Finally, I would like to list some intangibles that I find are necessary and go along with the teaching process. Don't ever take your quarterback for granted. Stress doing it right - all the time. Give your quarterback an offense he can handle. Be positive for he needs to have your confidence. Remember that a good passing attack takes a unified effort comprised of good line blocking, good backs and good receivers. Keep things simple - work with the pass patterns and running plays he'll be using in the game. Simulate game conditions as close as possible when running drills.<br>  <br>  12. Drills<br>  <br>  Work with receivers as much as you can. The more he throws, the better your QB will be. Here are some suggestions for basic drills that should improve your quarterback:<br>  <br>  1. Goal post drill  Line up QBs 10 yards from goal post - throw ball as close as you can to cross bar. Helps you get your arm up and over<br>  2. Quick release drill Coach positions himself facing two or more QBs. He has them take their drops and throw when he (coach) drops his hand. You will see immediately who has the quickest release<br>  3. Open man drill Coach stands behind QB and designates one of the four receivers to catch the ball. When QB is ready to throw, receiver raises his hand and QB throws immediately. This drill forces QBs to look downfield.<br>  4. One-on-one drill Throw all patterns here - outs, ins, post, flags, fly, curls, etc.|`|2a4b74139c38f025720894b5e336fc42aa	Tape football games, and watch them to see what the QBs are doing. Excellent case studies would be Tom Brady and Peyton Manning. Field vision is vital to a QB, and learning what to look and how to react to pressure are just as vital as practice and working out...|`|APyqQnfRaa	being a good quarterback is all about the mechanics.  Learning the play book backwards and forward knowing when to take 3,5, or 7 step drops.  Leadership skills is also essential.|`|EZHN7wJzaa	Lift a lot of weights.  Bench press and tricep work(mainly dips) are the best workouts for a QB, and if you have to scramble often, focus on squats too(they strengthen the hamstrings which are responsible for your speed).  Do a lot of speed and agility training, they will help with your footwork.  Playing basketball helped me with agility and footwork too.  But whenever you get the chance, work with the recievers that will be starting alongside you because your chemistry with them will effect your performance on the field.|`|ZOgcqaEIaa	I am not going to take anything away from Farez's answer, because all of those things will make you a physically better quarterback.  Practice.  Everything on that list needs to be practiced all the time.  any down time you have you better work on that stuff.  stay in shape.  dont get lazy and sluff in the offseason.  condition yourself all year long.  work on arm strength as well.  a strong arm is desired in football, and if its accurate as well you are going to be a highly sought after player.  The most important thing that i believe Farez missed though is that you absolutely MUST know your playbook inside and out.  You need to know what every play is hoping to achieve, know which play to audible to, know which defensive schemes to look for.  Watch the defense.  You have to be Smart.  watch tape do your homework on every team you will face.  what is their base system, what do they run at you, if they blitz you may need to play out of the shotgun or switch up snap counts alot.  its all about knowing the defense, and knowing your play book, and taking from the play book what will shred your defense.
5mD9LnQqaa	I am a huge fan of the game, it is fun and entertaining.  Plus it is a nice change from all the regular football games that have been out ver the years.  At least in Blitz the League you can play football the way it is relly played.

029ih0s6aa	Calvin Johnson right off the back....we are talking about a guy who is getting more press as a wide receiver going into the draft then anyone else. He has amazing speed: a 4.35 (40 time) with borrowed shoes, has a incredible leaping ability, fantastic hands, and is a big 6'5'' very built guy. He's nickname fits him well too, the freak!|`|8ebadd373b6fc96d2b7fc937e9e81ad8aa	Calvin Johnson by far.  Calvin Johnson is the best player in this draft.  Adrian Peterson has a style of play that a draft has every year.  Calvin Johnson like players do not come around too often.|`|AA11501821	CALVIN JONSON NO DOUGHT IN YOUR MINE OR NOTHING|`|MR0hIXGeaa	Johnson, no doubt. He had a terrible college quarterback throwing to him, and he still performed at a very high level.|`|XSKyv7r1aa	Peterson is better at his position. Johnson never dominated a game as he should have and Peterson still gained over 100 yards a game with 8 men in the box.|`|wuUyd2BRaa	That's a tough one. If I had to choose I would say Calvin because great college receivers tend to be more NFL ready than great college backs. Mainly because you just never know how a back can handle the constant pounding(20-25 carries a game) over a 16 game NFL schedule.|`|AA12074189	Calvin Johnson is a one in a life time receiver. He has size, strength, speed, and a great catching ability. Unlike Peterson, he is not injury prone, and I see him as becoming one of the top wide receivers in the NFL.|`|AA11433419	Calvin Johnson|`|35a65ceab14f2b73328801be0c229651aa	adrian peterson in college <br>  <br>  but who cares?<br>  <br>  they are coming to the pros, and nothing in college matters after draft day. They are on a new level<br>  <br>  lets see who proves themselves in the pros|`|AA12253571	From what I hear, Calvin Johnson can be a Pro-Bowl caliber receiver the moment he sets foot on the field.|`|a87e63e84d30d91092c2d7a318770320aa	johnson, peterson is comming off an injury too|`|dbd321fb08640ea557f8ffb4b79535efaa	I don't think you can get a fair judgment now; they haven't even played an NFL down. On the draft boards both players are #1 at their position. I think Adrian Peterson has the better chance of being the impact player just because it is easier for RB's to make an impact than WR's. WR's have to rely on a decent QB to make the throws. RB's just need the ball handed off to them.

One of the best backs I ever saw in 32 years of coaching was only 5' 7". He was fast and every time he touched the ball he smelled end zone. He beat my school team twice in four trys. He had an eye for open holes in the defense. My advice is work on speed and play smart.|`|37326d493404b67acc3b640d83096067aa	You are not small at all. You will need to work on your speed and work on getting stronger, because u would need it for football. A good position for you would be a conner back. If u have good speed you could be a running back but u would need speed, quickness, and wont drop the ball when getting tackle. Also you wont find anything to help u grow taller. but there are lots of stuff out there to help u get stronger. For example RIPPED FUEL will help u a lot on getting stronger. You have to run a lot during summer time on your own so you would have lots of endurance which will help u a lot for football.|`|c6681b364ab65916d96444a1cac4c076aa	A daily vitamin is always just a good thing to take. Makes sure you have the nutrients you need. As for a position, if you are fast you could be a runningback or possibly a wide receiver if you can catch well.

vCKJ8iKPaa	Baseball is in his blood.  Professional sports to these guys, and the competition that goes with it, are like drugs.  They don't want to stop playing.<br>  <br>  Remember Wille Mays stumbling around in the outfield?  <br>  <br>  It is a moment that no professional athlete wants to think about...the day they hang up the cleats.  <br>  <br>  Randy Johnson is in his 40's.  He is an old man in the baseball world.  I believe that he is at the end of his playing career.<br>  <br>  Now, will he be totally inneffective?  No, he will provide much needed help to some teams.  That being said, he will not be playing on any world series contenders this year or for the remainder of his career.<br>  <br>  I for one would like to see Randy Johnson retire without making too much a fool of himself.|`|20c39869681c620456bd83d3a9c63a23aa	I'm not sure in what way he can help them.

PxwQ6wGYaa	get drunk before the draft this year...|`|2zEO4Hq6aa	With a QB as good as Eli ( I know all of you non-belivers do not agree ), you need better protection, a fast receiver, and a better running game. Yes the giants need a LB, but they are many. stick to building around your QB.|`|4b1ceaa46aa120eb6b53d8602b81f757aa	Michael Bush is a great pick, assuming he returns to full health. But I don't think he will be around in the 4th.  My guess is he was a first round guy but when he had his latest surgery he dropped to the second round.  With the limited number of RB's in the draft, and his size and athleticism... I doubt he'll last past the 2nd round.|`|Hv496AkOaa	LB Jon Beason, Miami. Kawika Mitchell is a nice pickup, but not necessarily the dominating LB that they've been searching for the last few seaons (Sorry LaVar Arrington, just didn't work out!). They need a guy like Anthony Gonzales, and it may be necessary for the Giants to draft two WR's in the draft, as there are so many talent ones available, and after Amani Toomer, you have no dependable WR's (Notice I did not mention Plaxico "I'll play a good game every other week" Burress - side note: it seems like when the Pittsburg Steelers don't overpay a WR to stay on their team, they get overpaid by their new team and suck like hell i.e. Randle El). Drafting offfensive line wouldn't be surprising either, Central Michigan T Joe Staley comes to mind.  I'm not really liking the idea of Michael Bush as a Giant, because they already have two runners that are between the tackles guys. I think a change of pace guy like Northern Illinois' Garrett Wolfe would be great for them. He's a prototypical 3rd down back and can be used in the return game, another lacking area last year. Wolfe reminds me of a faster version of Dave Meggett.<br>  <br>  As far as Manning, there's just too much pressure on him and he can't handle it. One he's a Manning, thats pressure in itself, and he's always going to be compared to his big brother Peyton, and two he's in a big market/media area in New York.  Look how they've crucified A-Rod in the past.  The Knicks consistent sucking and the Yankees World Series drought is the only thing that makes it easier on Eli Manning. Maybe you shouldn't have DEMANDED a trade. Maybe you shoulda been a Charger. Call Phillip Rivers and ask him how its working out.|`|OWbMSMNraa	I'm not sure I agree with the above answers, but I'm not 100% sold on Eli's mental toughness.  <br>  <br>  Eil IS still a very young guy.  Yet, Vince Young is Young-ER still and performing very well.  <br>  <br>  So, I think the jury is still out on Eli, but drafting a QB would really be a blow to his confidence.  So, it would probably do more harm than good.<br>  <br>  I think we also need to consider a running back.|`|XP0a4cYQaa	See who takes who they trade eli for them.|`|b8b71dd90d1df59ac71646789ff94ab9aa	If all that happen, everything you say will be a steal and if they do good, they will be a beast.

For they LBs,. Kawika Mitchell is a nice pickup but I think  Paul Posluszny is an upgrade. Other first round selections could be Levi Brown OT, Penn St and Joe Staley OT, Central Michigan, because they cut Luke Pettigout. If they draft Posluszny they should draft Justin Blalock OT/OG Texas in the 2nd round.|`|9UTbpIWUaa	Trade away Eli|`|SK3t9dveaa	Maybe you should get a QB. Eli looks worse every year.|`|bHvYP441aa	1st round  Paul Posluszny, Penn State, LB, 6-1 236lbs, i agree with you that we need a corner but probable wait until the 3rd round and in the 2nd round the giants should adress their need at OL and in the 4th get a guy such as Garret Wolfe of Texas Tech or Darius Williams of Notre Dame.

They match well against other teams in the east (with the exception of the Heat) and many on the west, so we'll see what happens.

Although Washington is a very solid team but they've been giving up a lot of points and defense is definitely their weakness. Arenas is a scoring machine and Jamison, and Butler compliment him very well, but with the lack of defense they can't lock it up. I say they finish 3rd in the division and overall 6th in the conference.

I was in a similar situation when I was in high school, and it really screwed up my game.

His coach may not understand that (many don't), but you need to try to get this through to him. Confidence is a HUGE part of being a good player.|`|AA11496656	well this happens to everyone, just tell him to relax and go with his instincts. No one is perfect, as long as you try its good enough.

If so then have him checked for asthma. If not tell him to relax and play the game. If he thinks to much about not making a mistake he is going to make a mistake. And I am sure the coach will not bench him for one error even MJ made errors.|`|VJ405bi8aa	Personally I believe this happens to everybody. However I have a problem with understanding his situation. When I played for my middle school yes I didn't do any playground stuff during the games. I'm not as nervous when I start a basketball game. Before the game I'm looking at the crowd and if I was to give a speech I would be nervous but when I step on that court I just feel at home its just basketball and nothing else matters. So u should tell your son to calm down and tell hin "Basketball that's what matters" he should just be loose and not uptight because your playing the coaches game and not letting natural ability take over.
f38c7234e80d488254e1dc797c63eab4aa	C'est une grosse source de conflit au niveau des horaires et des soins. Un cheval demande beaucoup d'attention et ce genre de partage ne marche quasiment jamais car il y en a toujours un qui est lésé (voir plus!). Il vaut mieux à ce moment là prendre un cheval en demie-pension, avec le club ou un propriétaire c'est beaucoup plus s?r. Ou bien si c'est un problème de prix prendre un cheval moins couteux à l'entretien (plus robuste). Car c'est pas le prix d'achat qui compte, c'est les frais qui viennent ensuite. Le Maréchal toutes les 3/5 semaines, le véto(3 à 6 fois par an en moyenne), le dentiste (1/2 fois par an), les transports, les aléas de la pension, le pré l'été, l'équipement, les soins et surtout une visite quotidienne si le cheval est en box ou tous les 2 jours si il est en stab ou au prés pour le faire travailler et s'en occuper. <br>  En résumé, pour ma part, je déconseille le partage. Mieux vaut la demie pension pour apprendre le dur hobby de propriétaire.Car c'est génial mais quand on est s?r d'assumer. Et puis un cheval on peut le monter jusqu'à ses vingt ans et après il faut penser à sa retraite....|`|b48f4a9ec725dc676b3723b7a6d31562aa	Le plus simple est de t'adresser à un club hippique près de chez toi où il y a svt des chevaux à acheter et prets à faire de la compétition|`|b8390140322b883124b7568ff2178e3daa	Moi je te conseillerais de s'adresser a ceux qui vendent les chevaux, ils seront les mieux places pour te dire quoi faire avant d'en acheter un...

C est completment idiot d acheter un bien qq kil soit conjointement avec une amie comme ?a. Acheter un bien de maniere conjointe implique un lien de co proprieté, un contractetc etc. C est deja assez compliquer d acheter par exemple une maison avec son mari/femme, avec qui on est sensé passer tte sa vie. <br>  Le pb c est que meme si ?a se fait, un cheval ne pas le bien idéal pour en partager la propriété car la on parle de droit et de legislation. Cela se fait surtt pour les grandes ecuries ou ils achetent des chevaux hors de prix et et que les proprietaires les font monter par des cavaliers pro en se partageant le fruit de la revente ou des gains de concours, bref, un cadre financier ou la legislation est clairement applicable. Mais dans le cas de ta copine et toi, mauvais plan. Prenez des demi pension sur des chevaux de proprio (moins de contrainte que les chevaux de club) perso moi c est ce que j ai, en plus j ai la chance de monter ts les jours car le proprio veut kon travaille 2 fois par jour le cheval et franchment je me dis que j ai ts les avantages "d avoir" un cheval sans les inconvenients! j ai meme pas a participer a la ferrure ou au soins (veto osteo etc).<br>  <br>  A oui, la ferrure c est tes les 7 semaines et pas 3 a 5. Moi aussi je croyais que c etait ?a mais on m a dit 7 semaines a ma theorie de galop 6.|`|b0a1c1ddcaa7ab87576e88994b9152b9aa	bonjours, je suis bien d'accord avec toutes les personnes qui te deconseille de prendre un cheval avec ton ami, tout sera source de conflis. Pour se qui es de la reponse qui te conseil de prendre un jeune cheval de deux an, prend bien garde a toi, si tu as le niveau requis pour un debourrage je suis d'accord mais sinon ce n'est pas le meme dressage qu'un chien!!!!et tu devra t'en occuper beaucoup plus souvent.|`|5650ed27dbe4ffa60ec2ff05f5b706f3aa	Si tu veux avoir un cheval mais que tu ne sais pas comment t'organiser, alors abandonne ou renseigne toi avant mais pas sur internet ! Renseigne toi directement auprès de professionnels ou de magazines spécialisés ! Et avoir un cheval a deux peut s'avérer assez compliquer !|`|5a83c9988a0c59e9e7c347b71cdaaf34aa	Comme beaucoup de monde, je te déconseille d'acheter à deux. Certes il y a des fois où ca se passera bien, mais dès qu'il commence a avoir des frais un peu conséquent (par exple si ton cheval il tombe malade), ca peut rapidement devenir source de conflit, et dans ce cas là, c'est le cheval qui trinque. Si c'est possible, ce que je conseillerai plutot c'est que l'une des deux achète le cheval, et que l'autre le prenne en demi pensions, si toutefois vous avez le meme niveau, sinon tout le travail de l'une sera détruit par le travail de l'autre.<br>  Dans tous les cas, réfléchissez bien aux frais (équipement, nourriture, pension, entretien, véto...) car ca ne s'improvise pas. Et pensez bien aussi à l'investissement "temps", il faut vraiment aller le voir tous les jours. Sinon le cheval sera malheureux...|`|9b08f460d6fef90768f01cca446b7347aa	c'est vrai qu'à deux c'est très compliqué mais le plus simple reste à tout divisé en deux : la pension les soins la maréchalerie.... Pour le montée il faut vraiment être oranisé car sinon c'est les conflits à longueur de temps.Il faut vous fixer des tranches horaires et des jours où vous le monter: tel jour c'est l'une à telle heure... Il faut toujour vous tenir au courant de ce que vous faite c'est comme ?a je pense que ?a marchera le mieux!!!!!! Bonne chance et bon courage !!!!!!!|`|a38512c200119290ae30fdc06832d703aa	L'idéal dans ton cas est de prendre un cheval en demi-pension.<br>  <br>  L'achat d'un cheval à deux est une source de conflit à long terme, si le cheval ce blesse avec toi comment ?a fonctionne.<br>  <br>  Pour ce qui est du cout du véto à l'année il est impossible de donner un montant car ?a depend de beaucoup de chose. <br>  <br>  Pour la ferrure y'a pas non plus de semaines exactes, ?a dépend de l'activité du cheval et surtout de la repousse de la corne.<br>  <br>  Ici pour une demi-pension les frais véto courant sont à la charge du prorio, la ferrure 1 fois sur 2, les vermifuges facturés aussi 1 fois sur 2.<br>  Pour le matériel à part la selle, ?a reste à la charge du proprio.<br>  La demi-pension monte 3X par semaine.<br>  <br>  2 ans pour un cheval je trouve ?a un peu jeune, mais bon dans l'ensemble je suis pas pour un débourrage précoce.<br>  Et si tu n'as pas le niveau mieux vaut prendre un cheval qui a déjà de l'expérience.

ZQct0AAIaa	Edición XXIX - 2008, Beijing, China|`|AA10492394	2008 beijing ?|`|PX16sbCSaa	LAUSANNE (EFE) -- El Comité Olímpico Internacional (COI) inauguró el lunes, víspera de que se cumplan dos a?os para que comiencen los Juegos Olímpicos de Pekín 2008, una nueva versión de su página de internet con el objetivo de convertirla en una referencia para todos los interesados en las próximas Olimpiadas. <br>  <br>  La nueva versión de la página www.olympic.org "pretende dar respuesta al interés de los entusiastas olímpicos, pero también convertirse en una referencia para los medios de comunicación de todo el mundo", explicó el lunes la organización internacional a través de un comunicado. <br>  <br>  <br>  Como ejemplo, detalla que los visitantes pueden acceder fácilmente desde la página de inicio a una galería virtual multimedia con más de mil archivos de vídeo, así como a la base de datos sobre medallistas olímpicos. <br>  <br>  <br>  En esa base de datos se incluye información desde los juegos celebrados en Atenas en 1896 hasta los de Turín, este mismo a?o, y se recogen los récords mundiales vigentes. <br>  <br>  <br>  Además, se creó un "link" o acceso directo a la sección de noticias del COI, que se actualiza diariamente y ofrece información sobre las actividades del organismo internacional. <br>  <br>  <br>  Específicamente para los medios de comunicación, facilita acceso directo al archivo de notas de prensa y de documentación del COI, así como a vídeos y archivos gráficos y sonoros sobre sus actividades, que pueden ser difundidos. <br>  <br>  <br>  El COI pretende mejorar progresivamente la página para conseguir que "se convierta en una referencia para los periodistas que busquen documentación sobre las Olimpiadas". <br>  <br>  <br>  Según la organización, en Pekín también está previsto celebrar que el martes quedarán exactamente dos a?os para que comience un acontecimiento que "dejará un legado único a China", ya que "el intercambio cultural -que supondrán los juegos- enriquecerá a su población y al mundo entero". <br>  <br>  <br>  "Cerca de un millón de personas participará en ceremonias organizadas en unos 4.900 puntos diferentes de la ciudad", apuntó el organismo a través de un comunicado en el que asegura que en las próximas semanas estarán preparados los primeros acontecimientos deportivos para evaluar el cumplimiento de los estándares olímpicos. <br>  <br>  <br>  El COI también anunció que entre los próximos 22 y 24 de octubre se celebrará en la ciudad china el V Foro Mundial del Deporte, la Educación y la Cultura y que, poco después, su Comisión de Coordinación también acudirá a Pekín para ayudar en los preparativos de los juegos durante los veinte meses previos.
aLdA5Hoxaa	Who cares?|`|0686e457a634ce1e335c836cdfa1f056aa	It doesn't matter. USC is like Notre Dame and Ohio State: no one will ever successfully sabotage those programs.|`|Hv496AkOaa	Let me get this straight. Yahoo is out to get USC? What basis do you have for this conspiracy theory?  Since this was in the football section, I'm assuming you speak of the USC Football Program.  Every media outlet goes overboard on hyping up USC. They've been good, at times great in the 2000's, but Yahoo, ESPN, Sporting News, Sports Illustrated, etc. all worship the men of Troy as if they were gods.  Last season's Trojans were not that great, but were being pushed for the BCS title game. Had not UCLA put it in their lives, they woulda made it because the media loves the Trojans.  If you wanna go to the NFL, play for USC. You'll have more attention than you can ever dream of, even being overhyped to the point where the NFL fans expect the players to walk on water once they get drafted to a team (Leinhard, Bush, White, etc).  There's no support for the theory that Yahoo is trying to sabotage USC.  Only USC can sabotage USC by committing recruiting violations or just recruiting one and two star HS players. No media outlet can and ever will sabotage or even attempt to sabotage USC football.  After all, the media has given USC a national title that they didn't even win (Yes I'm from Baton Rouge, LA and we LSU fans are still pissed about that because WE won the BCS TITLE game & USC won the consolation 3rd place game and they gave them a "paper" championship, the AP poll is voted on by MEDIA MEMBERS).

Being thrown out of baseball for life, when he arguably played GREAT is something I just don't understand.

If the Chicago owner had been honorable with the players in their contracts they would not have thrown the series. Shoeless Joe went to the owner with the money and information and they (owners) told him to keep it and just play. He was clearly the best player in the series, made no errors, hit the series only homer, and hit as usual. The fact he was uneducated worked against him when he was interviewed. They had him mark his X to papers without having someone independent read to him what was in them. When he tried to say something in court about that he was told to shut up.  Babe Ruth was once asked who he copied his swing after, "Greatest hitter in the game Shoeless Joe!"|`|f3776a1637602da0385ce8d0a222e781aa	whats up with all the 1919 World Series questions.  I'll tell you what I told the last guy...Joe Jackson hit over .400 for that series and his absence from the Hall of Fame is the single greatest travesty in all of sports, much greater than the highly publicized Pete Rose absence.

Kickers dont realy make diffrences.  its not worst|`|IlISkjn4aa	It isn't bad.  I've seen worse.  Chambers, Coles, and Reggie Brown should all be starting before Holmes and Wilson.  I don't get why almost all the backups are WRs though.  He only has one RB that is even going to start.  QB doesn't look that great but he should be able to pick up someone else like Tavaris Jackson or some other low-end QB with good potential.  It's a fixer-upper but it isn't the worst ever.

Recordaba el hecho pero no la oportunidad, por lo que ingresé al "mataburros" y hurgando en la historia encuentro la siguiente cita:<br>  Por primera vez en la historia de los Juegos se disputa el maratón femenino, en que se impuso con rotundidad la estadounidense Joan Beanoit.

Hemos sido rápidos en las últimas pruebas que hemos hecho en Silverstone y sabemos que las características del circuito son favorables al R26 y no hay ninguna razón para pensar que no estaremos adelante. Los Ferrari serán fuertes así como los McLaren, si conservan su competitividad mostrada en Mónaco. No será un fin de semana fácil, pero estoy seguro que podremos luchar por la victoria", manifiesta Alonso en la página web de Renault F1. <br>  <br>  Sobre las diferencias encontradas en el circuito con los nuevos motores V8, Fernando Alonso comenta que "hay muchas curvas rápidas en Silverstone y aunque los coches ahora tienen menos potencia, ahora tienen más agarre gracias a los neumáticos más blandos y ahora pasamos más deprisa por las curvas y la primera parte se hace con el acelerador a fondo, es la mayor diferencia que hemos encontrado hasta ahora entre los motores V10 y V8" <br>  <br>  El actual líder del mundial admite que: "físicamente es más duro, con tantas curvas rápidas y la pista con tantos baches, el circuito de Silverstone es difícil para los pilotos, aunque muy divertido porque puedes pasar a fondo por las curvas rápidas, al límite del coche". <br>  <br>  Para Fernando Alonso el Gran Premio de Gran Breta?a representa: "correr en casa, la fábrica de Enstone está a media hora del circuito y todos los miembros del equipo irán a ver la carrera, así que intentaremos dar espectáculo para todos los compa?eros y eso hace de ésta carrera una cosa muy especial". <br>  <br>  Los neumáticos han jugado un papel primordial en las últimas carreras y el actual campeón del mundo cree que: "las gomas Michelín que hemos probado en Silverstone hace dos meses era muy buenas, así que confío que sean las mejores el próximo fin de semana. Pero habrá que esperar a ver como evoluciona el estado de la pista. En las últimas carreras hemos visto como han cambiado las condiciones desde la primera sesión de entrenamientos a la carrera y como funcionarán los neumáticos el domingo por la tarde". <br>  <br>  Por último Fernando Alonso explica que para el circuito de Silverstone hace falta un coche que: "tenga una aerodinámica eficaz para las curvas rápidas, una comportamiento estable, una amortiguación que le permita subir bien los bordillos y después una buena tracción mecánica para la última parte del circuito. Silverstone tiene dos caras, es muy rápido en la primera parte y lento y sinuoso en el final. Es un trazado que hace la diferencia entre los coches buenos y malos.|`|H2I5pueTaa	ninguno si te gusta y lo practiks.. pro para mi rapel|`|UFWbL8w6aa	100 litros planos y el lanzamiento de jaibolina|`|xVS5ICxcaa	Si es un deporte circo, ya que necesitas equilibrio perfecto.|`|Hv2OjEzKaa	de verdad...pienso el basket..pero no lo dificil dl juegoo o d como markar puntos NOOOO.... piensooo la agilidad ..ya q practikmente estas todooo el partido moviendote corriendo saltando....a diferencia d otros deportes q no corres tanto o si corres pero no tanto tiempo seguidoo..en el basket uno corre muchoo tiempo seguidooo|`|i62cfKLgaa	LAS CANICAS AJAJAJ<br>  NO YO SIENTO QUE EL POLO O EL GOLF

NVpAER21aa	Además de lo sabido del gran negocio que representa el el fútbol a nivel mundial, particularmente en México creo que se debe dar prioridad al juego en sí y no a los intereses de unos cuantos, una vez resolviendo este "peque?o" problema (terminar con la mafia) se puede hacer lo siguiente:<br>  <br>  - Quitar la liguilla (no es posible que equipos que han hecho torneos tan mediocres tengan las mismas posibilidades que un superlíder de ser campeón)<br>  - Eliminar el sistema de descenso.<br>  ?Cómo?...... Así<br>   En lugar de 17 fechas considero se deben jugar 34 (ida y vuelta), si bien la Federación Mexicana de Futbol (FMF) cuenta con 2 boletos para la Copa de Campeones de la Concacaf, 2 boletos directos a la copa libertadores, 1 repechaje a la Copa Libertadores y no estoy seguro si son 2 o 3 a la copa Sudamericana en fin, el equipo que hace más puntos es el campeón y así sucesivamente, en cuanto al descenso considero que los 2 equipos que hagan menos puntos en el torneo son los que descienden (No se debe premiar la mediocridad).<br>  Ahora bien el campeón y el subcampeón deben ir a la copa de Concacaf (es la copa que los conduce al mundial de clubes), luego del 3er al 5to lugar a la copa Libertadores, el 6to y 7mo a la sudamericana, dos equipos ascienden de primera "A" y así se permite la competencia.<br>  Para que también haya más competencia se podría jugar una copa que albergara a los equipos de la primera división y de la primera "A" también (como la copa del Rey en Espa?a, copa Italia en "Italia", la de Alemania, etc.) así se pueden jugar los emocionantes juegos de Eliminatoria directa (como la liguilla) y darle competencia a los equipos de primera "A" así como experiencia a sus jugadores pues honestamente nadie voltea a ver dicha liga.<br>  <br>  Y sólo así se puede cambiar el calendario adecuándolo con las fechas de la Copa Libertadores, Sudamericana, etc. <br>  Ventajas:<br>  -Competitividad (los equipos no pueden relajarse y jugar partidos de "promoción" para no descender, dejaría de ser mediocre)|`|0205e7991b1fc0e5f48ffb3f7b0e45ceaa	Pues creo que el desenso no está bn manejado, tienen mas chanse, siento que hacen crecer la mediocridad.

Fabregas es un jugador que lleva la batuta del juego desde atras aunque pueda jugar en la mediapunta su maximo rendimiento es en el centro dirigiendo el juego. Los del Madrid lo deberian fichar pero no para el ultimo pase sino para darle la clase al juego que tanto tiempo llevan buscando. Si lo fichais considero que con Granero y los que tenis ahora no haria falta ningun mediapunta(Para el ultimo pase).<br>  <br>  La opcion de Riquelme para el madrid yo la desecharia, nadie duda de su calidad pero hoy en dia hay que trabajar muy duro y Juan Roman, no lo hace.|`|pgDOapCaaa	a matias fernandes o alexis sanchez, no lo digo por ser chileno, pero si los vieras jugar verias a que me refiero.|`|t8CX2wt9aa	a sneijder del ajax el joven chaval juega muy bien al football

AA11921177	Congratulations Mr Kennedy n.1 Fan! You've worked pretty hard for it!<br>  <br>  And the answer to your question: Yes i do like Randy Orton's legend killer gimmick in that it makes him seem like a believeable heel and can make the casual fans love to hate him some more. I actually love that he is a heel for some weird reason and him killling off these "legends" certainly helps that. The only thing i don't like about his gimmick is that they are bringing back wrestlers to the ring who should really just stay in retirement and not return to the ring.|`|Ed3lyFc9aa	I DONT LIKE HIS GIMMICK CUZ HE MADE HBK INJURED|`|a34e0cf087365f52555b4ec9cfccb8bbaa	Congratulations..

c7af484739bc538a00373dde9a2d1a53aa	Trish's wrestling skills sucked in the beginning. There was a time where Lita was the better wrestler than Trish. Near the end of their careers, Trish seemed to have better skills than Lita(Lita's injuries played a factor). Lita was the one that deserved the happy ending, not Trish. It goes to show that WWE dosnt appreciate the women's division. The proof is in a diva search contestant winning the women's title and Victoria being sent to Smackdown where there is no women's title. WWE dosnt care about the women's division and apparantly not enough fans care. If the fans did, they would be chanting "this sucks" and "we want wrestling" when the worthless diva matches start.|`|42df1de907c5243ff6a1d2bee4108c82aa	are u dumb??? does 7 womens titles say or mean anything???|`|727d7e47afd7d0b1ceb01fdf824d755caa	She was a crowd pleaser and would do anything McMahon said.

SHE WAS NOT REALLY THAT GOOD AT WRESTLING AND SHE WAS NOT ALL THAT PRETTY TO ME.

That would totally rock!!!!<br>  Or it might even have a similar look to the tops that he has! Randy wears 'Affliction' (a brand) tops which are awesome! And his new WWE T-shirt (his merchandise) looks awesome!<br>  <br>  Whatever way the belt turns out to look like, it will always look better......because it is aroung the true WWE Champion's waist......The Legend Killer, Randy Orton's!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Good question, here's a star! I haden't really thought of him changing the style of the title, but I do hope he goes old school and stick with the original WWE Championship!<br>  <br>  P.S. WOOHOO! I see you've joined PAC! You rock!<br>  PAC RULES!<br>  CENA SUCKS!<br>  RANDY FOR WWE CHAMPION!<br>  "It's true, oh it's true! =)<br>  <br>  Summerslam 2007 is Randy Orton's destiny!|`|IFzChR9caa	I hope he brings back the old belt|`|QphfuVNraa	LOL<br>  I Hope!!<br>  <br>  Randy Orton <br>  Next WWE Champ at SummerSlam!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Chau..!!|`|XTunrxX2aa	I'm sure he will.

(Mark Van Eeghan-AFC) and 32 years since a white running back was chosen in the first round of the NFL draft.

2fe9ba4cac5c4112b8eb998f52612b65aa	Salut Darjeeling,<br>  <br>  L'intérêt dans une demi pension c'est que les cavaliers "impliqués" et le Cheval se fassent plaisir! Anciennement cavalière de CSO (2nd Degré), je suis passée par la demi pension [car l'achat d'un cheval doit longuement se m?rir (oui, on a tendance à craquer facilement..mais..)]. Le choix d'une demie pension est un peu similaire à savoir, il ne faut pas  se précipiter..<br>  Le Dressage est une discipline exigeante et doit se faire de fa?on "raisonnée" et je le dis surtout pour le Cheval car de la manière dt  vous (le proprio+toi) procédez (c'est à dire dans le "conflit"), le travail effectué risque d'être organisé de fa?on contradictoire  et non pas dans l'idée d'une bonne et réelle  progression .<br>  Le conseil que je pourrai te donner (et je rejoins DIDEN) c'est de ne surtout pas abandonner et changer de Cheval. Tu penses que ds choses st bonnes pour lui, pour toi, pour le travail à l'obstacle.. (c'est à souhaité quand même que le proprio ait compris que pour être performant à l'obstacle, un bon , long et minutieux travail sur le plat est incontounable et indispensable!..) ALORS organisez quelques reunions avec le moniteur qui doit aussi s'impliquer, pardi! ( dans le boxe, après tout le Cheval doit aussi donner son avis...je rigole )sur une fa?on de travailler commune et allant dans le même sens de la progression. Revoyez le planning s'il le faut et ce que chacun doit travailler quand et à quel rhytme et ce,  POUR ALLER DE L'AVANT!<br>  Documentes toi beaucoup, revues, web, forum..pas pour en mettre plein "la vue" mais pour  "mieux présenter" ton avis (partagé par le mono ou d'autres PRO) et "pousser" le proprio à t'écouter et à partager les points de vue. Ne rester pas campés sur vos positions, surtout.<br>  Le temps de la promenade, le voilà le vrai moment de complicité avec ton Cheval, profites en pour "t'essayer" à deux, trois trucs (sans l'énerver car c'est un moment de detente aussi pour lui..)..La pluie.le vent, la neige, la boue, quelle importance puisque tu es avec lui???..<br>  Remets vite de la cohérence dans tout ?a.  Indispensable dans une telle  discipline , plus que dans une autre car le Cheval est un être VIVANT (et pas un jouet ),que l'on ne doit pas négliger ,à qui l'on ne doit faire vivre et endurer n'importe quoi sous pretexte que quelques humains "cavaliers" se font des "gueguerre" non fondées...<br>  Sans faire de parti pris (hum, hum), je suis une inconditionnelle des" grands Ma?tres" et notemment de Jean D'Orgeix ..on aime ou pas mais si tu ne connais pas il ya des sites consacrés à lui et son Oeuvre..<br>  Reste POSITIVE, continues à Aimer ce Cheval et à te faire plaisir..|`|b5ON9tevaa	Salut,<br>  <br>  Dit toi tout simplement que si il n est pas capable de se remettre en question, ou de pouvoir t expliquer concretement le but de son travail "négatif" pour le cheval, c est qu il n est tout bonnement pas fait pour etre cavalier...<br>  <br>  Je serrais toi je changerais de cheval car le fait que votre travaille est a l opser l un de l autre, le cheval n avance plus et du coup tu ne sait pas faire progresser enormement le cheval non plus ce qui va resulter que ton niveau va stagner.<br>  <br>  Je sais ce que c est que de monter un cheval corectement et ensuite le laisser a une autre personne qui va "bousiller" le travail qu on as mis dedans et puis qui nous le rend parceque ca ne va plus avec lui...<br>  <br>  C est tres désagréable donc si tu as le choix, arrette et choisis un cheval avec lequel tu prendra du plaisire, et avec lequel tu pourra progresser|`|5288b3c382490258e60fe10b977ba6a3aa	Je pense que le proprio aura toujours le dernier mot, donc le mieux est que tu passes à un autre cheval.

D'autant que tu t'épanouiras plus vite avec un cheval moins problématique.|`|Y3CNsGKPaa	un bon cavalier laisse faire  tous les critique  et dénigrement sur lui par amour a son cheval ne cède pas a ses accroc,moi je suis cavalier de 3ème degré et j'aime les chevaux et l"équitation ces mon sport préféré alors il me dénigre ou pas c'est un sport  avant tous il fallait supporter par amour de ton choix bonne chance .

Desde ese a?o hasta entonces hemos visto que muchísimos jugadores pueden correr con una velocidad muy alta. <br>  Esta el ejemplo de Ronaldo, más bien en su época con la camiseta del Bar?a 1996/1997, porque luego regresó a Italia y con el Internazzionalle(Inter de Milan) sufrió una gravisima lesión que lo dejó apartado casi dos a?os, más tarde fichó por el R. Madrid y ya le pesaban los a?os, consiguió ser pichichi, pero más por los pases de sus compa?eros como Raúl, Zidane, Figo, Becks, etc. que por sus carreras individuales. <br>  Ronaldinho por su parte, tiene un músculo que está muy bien trabajado con horas y horas en el gimnasio(jaja no me refiero a los dientes jaja), se llama el bíceps femoral, es decir los muslos (por su zona trasera). Esto influye mucho a la hora de driblar y también esprintar, porque es el primer musculo que funciona al mandar esa orden.<br>  Messi tiene una velocidad impresionante, eso se debe a su altura: 1,68 m. Al ser más bajito de lo normal, tiene una mayor agilidad, pero es un jugador que debe de cuidar mucho el físico porque no le interesa mucho despegarse del suelo o recibir pases por alto.<br>  Thierry Henry actual delantero del Bar?a, creo que ha marcado el mayor registro, la verdad es que es bastante alto (1,88 m) lo que hace que pueda alargar más las piernas y tener un mayor salto a la hora de rematar.<br>  <br>  Pero mi voto es para el jugador portugués del Manchester United: Cristiano Ronaldo. El jugador de 22 a?os tanto como con balón como sin él, es el más rápido. Aunque es un poco más bajito que Henry, 1.85 m, alarga bastante la zancada, y muchas veces parece que salta en vez de correr. Visto desde el punto de vista técnico, utiliza la técnica del guepardo, que es alargar lo máximo las dos extremidades inferiores para su pleno rendimiento.<br>  <br>  Gracás por leer mi opinión contrastada con los estudios... Eso, ?qué viva el fútbol!|`|0gq2hAkiaa	el mas rapido es THIERRY HENRY, a parte es el mejor jugador del mundo, tambien puede ser MARTINS el nigeriano y ODONKOR esta entre estoe tres|`|XvCYbgrkaa	Ronaldinho, con el balon en los pies, y simplemente corriendo.

YgYpSpnLaa	The key is to learning how to shoot the ball on a perfect angle. It's about wrist control... you have to learn how to shoot flicking your wrist in a straight way. <br>  <br>  It takes practice, but some people naturally get it. If you can shoot, then it means you have a natural knack for flicking your wrists right! Take it from the foul shoot champ ;)<br>  <br>  to the person below.. i always knew how to play basketball! its my 2nd favourite sport, just behind football ;) and my knowledge of football will always be #1!! i just happen to know how to play a lot of sports|`|fe8d97ffb886fafd044dd56cda67e6d7aa	Bela.. since when did your basketball knowledge become greater than footie knowledge.. you should be ASHAMED OF YOURSELF!!!<br>  Dont shoot like SHAQ!<br>  Bela got a lot of it right but she didnt mention you want a complete follow through.  If you see the great foul shooters like Nash etc they all have complete follow throughs.|`|bgL74idMaa	Just Relax|`|6xNRvrPiaa	Relax, focus, & use your legs to jump if you need to. & if you keep your arm straight & practice, you do better.|`|7xeTn6s0aa	Two main things:<br>  1) Proper technique-this means doing the basics right, such as follow through and extension<br>  2) Find a routine that you like and practice, practice, practice.|`|9Y7a3TSJaa	The key to good foul shooting lies in being as comfortable as possible when at the foul line.  Some of the greatest shooters of all-time have had some of the worst form, take for instance Rick Barry using the underhanded, granny form. You just want to get there, relax, and learn to mentally block all distractions so that you can make your shot.|`|9zZ0bif8aa	Bend your knees, concentrate on the hoop, get loose, followthrough. On my All-Star team I averaged 86 percent from the free throw line. And when you are bored at night or anytime get a ball, put it above your head flick your wrist and try to catch the ball about at your nose.

NpbexR6Baa	I - The play formation most probably the I formation<br>  <br>  Z-Motion - Tells the "Z" reciever or the flanker (behind the line of scrimmage) to go into motion<br>  <br>  244 - The blocking scheme for the offensive line<br>  <br>  H-Swing - The actual play being called. Has the routes and assignments for the RB's WR's and TE, most probably a Halfback swing pass<br>  <br>  Hence, I Z-Motion 244 H-Swing<br>  <br>  <br>  That's what I'll guess. But football terminology differs from team to team so you're guess is as good as mine|`|0AvrRFqPaa	I formation-----Z receiver in motion and H is halfback swing pass.  Thats what i think....|`|Gva0qq3Yaa	I backfield, Slot back motion across formation, 2hundred pass protection both outside receivers run square outs with the tailback on an "arc" route out of the backfield.<br>  <br>  That is so much easier to say.|`|a87e63e84d30d91092c2d7a318770320aa	well it all depends what school,  but it probably means that the team is in I formation (the I) and Z is usually the right ouside reciver and he is going to be in motion. 244 can tell the line what to do and the other recivers what route to run. H-Swing means that the Running Back (H) runs a "swing" route which means a short route straight to the sideline.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps

2fe9ba4cac5c4112b8eb998f52612b65aa	Salut Liz,<br>  <br>  Pas facile...voilà tout ce que j'ai pu trouver comme réponse pour l'instant (sur www.hyppotherapy.be) mais en cherchant mieux...<br>  <br>  <br>  C'est à l'occasion des premiers jeux olympiques modernes, en 1896, que la dimension des pistes de dressage a été réglementée. Autrefois, dans les manèges, on utilisait des signes conventionnels pour marquer le début et la fin des diagonales. A l'Ecole Espagnole de Vienne, ce sont encore les symboles du jeu de cartes qui sont utilisés. Autour de la piste de dressage moderne se trouvent des lettres. L'origine précise de ces lettres n'est plus connue. Mais on raconte que ces points de repère représentent la première lettre du nom des pays participants au premier J.O. moderne. Les différentes mesures d'un manège Les manèges et les carrières peuvent avoir toutes les dimensions. Toutefois, si on veut pouvoir les employer de fa?on optimale, il faut respecter certaines dimensions. <br>  <br>  20 x 20 m : dimensions d'un rond de longe ou pour l'enseignement des débutants ou pour un poney-club. idéales pour l'enseignement des cavaliers car ils restent facilement à la portée du professeur. <br>  <br>  20 x 60 m : dimensions réglementaires pour les reprises de dressage olympiques. <br>  <br>  Voici  comment doit se présenter une piste olympique de dressage . Attention, une erreur souvent commise est de conserver les lettres intermédiaires (P- L -V -S- I - R) dans une  piste 20 x 40 m. Ces lettres, alors ne correspondent plus à une distance requise pour exécuter certaines figures. <br>  <br>  Pour l'enseignement des enfants, en desous de la lettre, on place une image  d'un objet commen?ant par cette lettre.|`|5b9d121714be7f8b176f01f433585daaaa	Cette question est très régulièrement posée ici, il n'y a pas d'origine connue, beaucoup de possibilités. Je ne m'en rappelle pas d'ailleurs. Mais on n'a pas à ma connaissance trouvé la raison pour laquelle les lettres étaient ainsi.

4MjHzR1Zaa	No need to acquire anyone, because the Pistons already have the future All-Star center in the shape of Amir Johnson. The 20-yr-old has been widely compared to Amare in terms of size, atheleticsm, explosiveness, and playing style. He does have a better defense awareness than Amare, though. Playing in the D-League has improved his skills in every department, and it is believed this this kid is still growing, height-wise (he is 6'11 now, with potential to go over 7-foot). All he needs to do is to gain playing times, and win trusts from the coaching staff.<br>  <br>  The Pistons will coming into the season with Nazr in the starting lineup (if Webber does not sign). By mid-season, I can easily see Amir claim the center position. Also, Joe D just recently signed Cheik Samb. He is more of a long-term project; give him 2 or 3 seasons, he will be a solid backup.|`|ddbVXDgAaa	KG definately. and Brian L KG could play center if he wanted too. there r 6-11 centers|`|dapON7Hzaa	Andy, Kevin Garnett is not a center<br>  he's a very tall small forward at best and not even a true forward; when i think of true centers i think of Shaq, Ewing, Robinson, Wilt, Kareem, big, tall and strong|`|0VnXrYxBaa	anderson varivoc|`|0zCnD4bQaa	the best center that they could possible get is chris mihm cause i don't think the lakers are keeping him.|`|mv4dTrzlaa	they should get ben wallace they won a championship with him in 04 but i dont think there gettin him back|`|AA11746190	You can make a trade for Jarron Collins of the Jazz.

La verdad volviendo al tema, yo pienso que debes intentarlo a ver si te sientes comodo, por lo general se entrena de 3 a 4 veces por semana, cuando se trata de competencias a veces 5 o 6, pero creeme que es interezante y es una bonita experiencia, ademas de que es muy bueno para la salud y la estetica tambien, te deseo suerte, espero que tomes la mejor desicion y si deseas saber mas me mandas un mail y con mucho gusto te ayudare...<br>  Suertee...|`|D5HWHRkOaa	bueno que empieces ya el atletismo es una disciplina muy hermosa y cuando la empiezas a practicar te enamoras de ella, te recomendaria que consiguieras un entrenador y te guiaras de sus entrenamientos ha y ponle muchas ganas ok.|`|QFDIATegaa	si te gusta correr...adelante y si te sientes con condiciones mejor aún.<br>  15 a?os es buena edad para iniciarte en el atletismo, podrías empezar a entrenar 4 a 5 vecez por semana.<br>  lo recomendable es que un entrenador te prepare un programa de entrenamiento, en todo caso podrías empezar trotanto por lo menos 30 minutos diarios.<br>  suerte|`|BdGGzbL0aa	si te gusta correr, adelante que esperas, yo te recomendaria que busques un equipo de atletismo.<br>   ya que si de verdad tienes facultades para ello, te ayudara a que te canalicen,  y podras que entrenes en grupo, que es la mejor manera de mejorar, entrenar solo es muy dificil y tedioso, y no mejoras tanto como en grupo, ya que encontraras jgente de tu nivel y mejores que tu y eso te hara mejorar.<br>   y te pondra en contacto con otros equipós asociaciones para competencias importantes y eventos internacionales|`|140c0f1b332de295f8a3563c23af4fadaa	Martin. Todos los que aspiran a corredores, ginasta, boxeadores etc. etc. comienzan desde muy temprana edad a ejercitar su cuerpo, ese es un ejercicio que de hacerlo diario, requiere una buena dieta en proteinas y dara buenos resultados, cada dia debes de pedirte mas y mas, competir en esos maratones que se efectuan a cada momento, ser diciplinado, calcular diariamente la meta, y irla superando diariamente, dedicale un para de horas diarias es suficiente. Suerte|`|9169e203c96d1ac7cdecf4fac52546e0aa	Felicidades, es el deporte más antiguo del mundo.<br>  <br>  Mira, yo llevo corriendo apenas 8 meses y me siento muy rejuvenecido, con gran energía, he perdido 11 kilos de peso y cada vez me siento mejor.<br>  <br>  Te recomiendo que si estás estudiando te asesores con tus maestros de educación física.<br>  <br>  También es posible entrar a un equipo de corredores.<br>  <br>  No dices de que parte del mundo eres, pero por lo general en las ciudades deportivas se junta mucha gente que al igual que tú y yo disfruta con correr.<br>  <br>  Inténtalo, verás que al cabo de un poco tiempo tu cuerpo y tu salud mejorarán mucho.<br>  <br>  Las endorfinas que el cuerpo genera al realizar deporte son una especie de droga natural que te mantendrá siempre de buen humor, es sumamente difícil que un deportista sea enojón.

Lo que si se es que el de velocidad tenian pensado hacerlo olimpico para este a?o, pero al final, no se por que, pues ahi se ha quedado . <br>  Para que un deporte sea Olimpico, tiene que haber un numero minimo de paises que lo practiquen si no me equivoco, asi que supongo que esa sera la razon principal por la que no esté entre los deportes olimpicos (aunque la verdad, me cuesta creer que el "curling" se practique en mas paises que el patinaje artistico sobre ruedas , ejem...)|`|sXKSUdJnaa	es un deporte olimpico!|`|c4e7c9c58d9ee8e892af757124004465aa	porque es un deporte que a nivel  mundial no cuenta con muchos participantes.<br>  <br>  J.|`|IJnVBqObaa	El patinaje si es un deporte olimpico amigo mío.|`|QFDIATegaa	si te refieres al patinaje artístico y/o al de velocidad (sobre hielo), son deportes olímpicos, pero no de verano, pertenecen a los juegos olímpicos de invierno que también se realizan cada 4 a?os, los pasados se realizaron en turin en el 2006, los próximos en vancouver 2010|`|abf0d593eee51745546111fec2088018aa	Yo pienso que eso es así, porque la industria de fabricación de patines se ha expandido demasiado y casi todo el mundo compra en su ni?ez los patines; resultando que en vez de ser un deporte para ganar trofeos y competencias, ha pasado a ser una ocupación y diversión de los fines de semana, muy común. <br>  Los viejos tambien practican el patinaje.|`|bxUYNgzpaa	Solo sé que Nora Vega y Claudia Rodriguez, fueron campeonas mundiales de patin carrera, tambien panamericanas y muchos premios mas, muchas veces y son de mi ciudad Mar del Plata, Argentina.
AA10940228	It sounds like you have a 2 QB league.  You should be safe with Brady and Smith during most of the season, but there are a few bye weeks you have to worry about.<br>  <br>  Chambers had a bad season last year, but things could turn around.  Crumpler may see the ball more in the red zone since Atlanta will be forced to throw without Vick in the lineup.<br>  <br>  It's a long season and another QB may emerge from the chaos for a bye week match-up.<br>  <br>  This trade is OK.|`|TVbKcA9Raa	do it. you already have a bunch of QBs on your bench. tarvaris is actually a pretty good sleeper. chambers may be good depending on trent green and crumpler will get his catches.|`|WEbhNUIeaa	of course, and whoever takes that trade, I hope I am in a league with them|`|c6020468b1b0192d1ecaeaed3294855daa	do it.|`|t5pTNzqTaa	This isn't even debatable.

AA11828783	Rest is very important in any kind of strength training, inclucing vertical. Most people don't really understand how your body gains strength (speed, hops, etc.) You don't get stronger when you are working out. When you lift, you are just slightly damaging that muscle group, which is why you are sore the next day. You gain strength as the muscles heal themselves. Think of it like this: have you ever had a cut that made a scar? You can feel a slight bump where the scar is right? That is what happens to your muscles. When they heal from the soreness, they get slightly bigger and stronger.<br>  Because of this, getting rest is just as important as lifting in the first place. If you lift real hard, but don't give that muscle time to heal, you don't get much stronger.<br>  I usually lift upper body one day, lower body the next. But the key is to let your muscles heal from each workout. When you stop feeling soreness, go work out really hard again.<br>  This is the most effective way to make progess.<br>  Good luck.|`|VjnDmPoeaa	you should get 48 hours of rest.|`|abwNo01Baa	Rest is a big key in vertical leap.  I usually take two days off when I am shooting 100+ shots everyday, working on my vert, and lifting some weights.  I hate resting but I do it because it works.  Anyways, taking two days off is enough.|`|jG5Ae1TEaa	if you feel tired you should take a qhole week off then go back. I did 8 weeks of plyos and then tested my vertical and it went up 4 inches. Then i took a week of and it went up 2 inches!!! You might  get more because you are doing squats

980f89ebb42e46b1ba378acdfe13e528aa	Get that bench press up.  You should be able to bench more than that.  Also, get your squat press up.  Leg strength is probably more valuable to you in a football game than your chest.  Your 40 speed is pretty good.  There are lots of D1 players who run 4.5 and slower.  And most importantly, get out on that field and play and get yourself noticed.|`|3wh5Y2wVaa	dont ever just settle for a d-3 team,if you work hard at it and stay focus you can be on a D-1 team|`|8smACXZTaa	tnx for the 2 points!!! =D|`|JsC3rThcaa	Hey anything is possible if you put your mind to it, plus you said it your self your a hard worker and football most of the time is about putting in a hard work out training.

Depends on who im with and the snow conditions/terrain that I will be shredding.  I do feel that skiing is a much more technical discipline than riding, and has a much longer learning curve.  I still feel challenged to get better every time I go out on skis.  On a snowboard, I have no desire to progress further than I have, and basically do the same stuff on different lines each time I go out.  I also enjoy the company of skiiers much more, as they tend to be more knowlegeable and mature than most of the snowboarders I hang out with.  Not saying that all snowboarders are punks, just the majority of them on YA.      Sorry boarders, love the sport, hate the common attitude that goes with it.  You see it from skiiers too, just not nearly as much.|`|Uj0kaV4aaa	Snowboarding. Because there are only two ways you can look when you're snowboarding: Lookin' cool or DEAD! Whereas in skiing you get that tipsy thing goin on... not so cool. I was snowboarding recently and i was going 6 or 7... thousand miles per hour, cause you really don't know, there's no one there to tell you, you're not gonna get pulled over on a mountain by a cop, b/c they have to be able to walk up to you in that condescending way. But you can only hop on a snowboard. Yeah, there I was lookin cool, but then I wiped out and I hit my head. My head was fine but my neck said "oh no, that won't do". So I had to go to a chiropractor, but snowboarding is indeed better.|`|Unaaay0Caa	snowboarding. i used to ski & switched over to snowboarding. i just have a lot more fun and like it better. thats basically it. the parks are cool for boarding and idk its just awesome, if you dont ride try it!!!!    =)|`|S8PEDGcVaa	snowboarding|`|oC9JqzG9aa	Skiing all the way.

gnj5Wublaa	Anyone who understands football & plays the game like i do, will say most definitely the sending off had a bearing on the game. You ain't gonna win the league this season i'm afraid, kopites!|`|5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	Yes.. they were all over chelsea... the stats say it all... I am very surpreised tho. Chelsea didnt turn up|`|UZUl0vG8aa	Who cares|`|4BppP7Mkaa	I think so... He wasn't doing much before he got sent off anyway.|`|HxET88bDaa	No surprise there at all, but i am not sure about the result had he not been sent off, it's hard to predict but saying that Lampard did not play well before the red is irrelevant. Players obviously can change their tempo throughout the match and it is highly probably that he would have had an effect in the latter stages of the match, much like Gerrard does. It's scandalous, but that's football.|`|ToxDHYsaaa	i don't know how anyone can say they still would of won!? its a shame that such a crap decision proved to be so vital in the game. Surely riley should know be bad awful judgement was more of a free kick to chelsea then anything!|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	I think it would have been a draw|`|dd1c4772483cf17b8d588eaddff60b28aa	The sending off definitely changed the game in Liverpools favour.  I think it might have been a 0-0 draw if Frankie had stayed on the pitch.    However, we will rise from the Ashes - don't write the Blues off yet!|`|sLEoWYr5aa	I am a Chelsea fan, but I think even if he hadn't have been sent off Liverpool would have still won the game, we were poor. Sending off was a joke, glad it was overturned but Riley should be relegated to the championship.|`|j3xwgrLBaa	Tbh Chelsea were never really in the game, and would lampard of stopped the cross? Probs not|`|kxMQXhuAaa	Who knows,but the better team won in the end.Chelsea were bad,even with 11 men.    I hadn't realised Lampard was playing until he got sent off tbh.|`|oTtRLkjEaa	We still would have won!  I know Lampard shouldn't have been sent off but was was fu**** Bosingwa playing at kicking Benayoun!!!  Should have been straight red but he's been let off cos he said he was 'sorry'!!|`|67qiqedgaa	yes telboy i do think we would have won, yes.|`|6rxhges4aa	it was the correct decision to overturn lampards red card.    that was never a sending off offence.    had lampard stayed on liverpool would still have won-you cannot change the hand of fate.|`|no3tD0OSaa	Lol, Am sure Alonso would have been sent off for tackling Lampard.    we all know how those two 'get'|`|8Pw7ujG0aa	it would probably have been 0-0|`|1WgOj89kaa	Yes, we still would have won, we dominated the game and Lampard would not have compensated for Alex's marking error and Torres being simply the best striker in the world.  You are beaten tomorrow my friend.|`|n18Q7t11aa	No.it would have been a draw.Chelsea did not deserve to lose.....but loserpool did not deserve to win !|`|V4STBjyFaa	it only happens for the sky 4 wat about cahills sendin off for us this season against the shite that was never overturned it would ov been a totally different game otherwise|`|DGciNIC5aa	yes we were battering them before fatty got sent off any way    and do you ever talk about your own club.. cos i have only seen about 2 questions about neverton on this section i mean i no your team is rubbish but you know
rjuqrHK7aa	I love all the Cats. Pattrick, Jodie, and Darius are some of my favorites. In the NBA I like Rondo, Prince, and Bogans.  Go Big Blue!!!

I also like porter for some reason.|`|rEafx4QTaa	jodie meeks is good that 54 point performance was impressive. my fav would be the rar heels wayne ellington, great all around game shooting and scoring|`|Z0AE7eHiaa	Terrence Williams aka Dunkenstein Jr.    Meeks should have played at louisville, he could have been a good sixth or seventh man.......
lBhkWpDoaa	that's what i thought    guess it depends on the extent|`|98wFqBwSaa	Yes, this white girl I used to ski with in Colorado told me so.|`|tY3rZSsiaa	thats what i thought, guess it depends on the extent of the injury.|`|2VVgxFDKaa	no its not.  I had a MCL tear playing bball too.  It requires no surgery and it is a self healer.  With the people they have to rehab it, he should be back way quicker than a normal person would be.|`|rEafx4QTaa	it can be depending on what point in the season you are, bynums out 8-12 weeks. now if it was at the beginning of the season he'd be ok , but the lakers would be lucky to have him for the playoffs and if he isnt 100 percent then why risk him, i mean they got to the finals with him being hurt last year|`|fz77R5Jmaa	im trusting the 2nd answer   and agree with the 3rd    they shouldnt bring him back until he is needed in the playoffs. Like for example they probably should have him for the finals but if they need him for the conference finals then bring him in but i dont think they will have any problem gettin the number one spot for the playoffs with their standing now compared to everyone else    i hope he doesnt hurt anymore knees for a while cuz thats no good and hes like what 20? 21? somethin like that and he can be really good by 23

Donc si vous voulez 0 risque, il ne faut pas s'attaquer qu'au complet mais plutot à la pratique de l'équitation tout court.. pourquoi le complet ???? c'est bien plus facile...|`|60ec1b25d2cbdd8a78ab0d7b2178f4ecaa	tout à fait d'accord bouffy<br>  <br>  tant que ce sport est un plaisir, ?a va, mais dès que ?a commence avec les compétitions de haut niveau, plus rien n'existe, à part le résultat<br>  <br>  tout le monde se moque du cavalier et du cheval, pourvu que le résultat soit bon<br>  <br>  d'accord avec toi aussi, rien de plus beau qu'un cavalier et son cheval parcourant la campagne, les bois !!!!<br>  <br>  comme tous les sports, quand il est question d'argent, rien ne va plus !!!|`|FVgWqroHaa	moi je deteste le cross et je n aime pas le cso. Mais le cross par dessus tout me terrifie car les obstacle ne sont pas mobiles et quand tu tombes sur un obstacle massif (genre chre nou on a un genre de charette qui doit faire 1m de haut et 90cm de large) ben la y a peu de chance que tu t en sorte sans une egratignure. En plus en exterieur les chevaux sont tjs plus vite et le rythme demandé sur un parcours de cross est plu soutenu que sur un cso. <br>  Pour moi faut etre tete brulée pour faire un cross c est le meilleur moyen de se creer un accident, et on parle pas des chevaux qui se blessent...<br>  Je connais une fille elle m a raconté etre tombé dans un trou a abords francs et sa jument est tombée par dessus elle. J imagine pas le flip.<br>  Que certains veuillent en faire c es une chose, mais imposé d en faire au passage des galops c est de l inconscience, tout le monde n a pas envie de triplé ses risques de rester paralysé a vie. <br>  Perso moi je ne fais que du dress, pas parce que je me sens plus en securité mais parce qu au dela de ?a je trouve qu a part a tres haut niveau, le cso et le cross c est tire et pousse, au plus vite pour etre le meilleur, et la beauté du sport, elle est ou?|`|l64G3H2haa	Je pense qu'il faudrait revoir la réglementation sur le temps dépassé: beaucoup trop de pénalités par seconde, ?a pousse à la prise de risque maximum dans les abords. Combien de chutes se produisent et sont graves pour des excès de vitesse et/ou des absences de remise en équilibre? <br>  <br>  Je pense aussi que la plupart des concours manquent de moyens humains et financiers pour construire des cross qui soient parfaitement sécurit. <br>  <br>  Enfin, je pense qu'il y a un problème d'éducation des cavaliers en club: combien courent les épreuves ventre à terre en 4 ème et 3ème sans que les BEE ne disent rien. Moi, le gosse qui roule n'importe comment sans jamais remettre en équilibre ou prendre le temps d'aborder proprement: je lui fais sa fête à la sortie et il va stagner dans sa catégorie jusqu'à ce qu'il respecte son cheval et apprenne à devenir intelligent. Une fois les mauvaises sensations prises, c'est trop tard pour redresser le tir. Mais, c'est vrai que la course aux classements...<br>  <br>  En tout cas, j'adresse toute mon amitié aux amis et aux familles de ces trois cavalières. Courage
f31934c5ab0ede56c2ad73c5a2c9979eaa	I am going with the Remington because hunting is in the equation as opposed to self-defense use alone.  For self-defense the Maverick would beat the others hands down because of price.  I owned one back in 1993 and it never failed.|`|WBGnXsr7aa	The 870 hands down, that would be my choice|`|TvARYVRJaa	maverick get a 18.5 inch  barell for home is you can load with  00 buck and 4 shot  and practice tactical,defense ok thanks|`|Y4RS35M7aa	I used to work in guns, and that Maverick shotgun is great, but not as flexible (as far as add-ons, etc) as the 870 or 500.  Still, for the money, it's a great buy and a good gun!    Enjoy!|`|nKosOzuVaa	For protection, whichever one makes the loudest noise when engaging, any criminal in the dark will recognize that sound and will want nothing more than to get our of your house :)    For hunting I have no idea, sorry.|`|9wfmpBMWaa	I would go with the 870 or 500 both are very reliable and are good hunting guns for the price.  Although very cheap the I have heard bad things about the Maverick.|`|3e8e34aadabc9c4673b05bc7f3e997a0aa	The Mossy 500 is a fine shotgun, but the 870 is by far tops.|`|9UUEhAYtaa	I have recommended the mossberg 500 to more people than i can shake a stick at, but they are all good guns. i have a mossberg 500 that i use for rabbit and turkey hunting, and if i needed to i would use it for home defense. no matter what you do, get the 12 guage. good luck and God bless|`|nXObyYlAaa	I would go with the remington 870 12 gauge hands down remington makes a great reliable gun.I have one and it is a gun i will never get rid of.|`|AVQzBE0daa	Stick with the Remington 870 Express.   Any doubt? ask just about any cop across America "what shotgun is in the truck of your squad?" They will reply Rem 870.|`|lT8MEI6Raa	I have the Mossberg Maverick and I really like it, especially for the price.  My brother in law bought a mossberg 500 and the ONLY difference was the location of the safety, and he paid more for his.  Every time (no exaggeration) i've gone shooting with people who have the remington 870, their gun has jammed, and i've put tons of rounds through mine and it has only jammed on me once. I won't lie, it does feel a little cheaper than the others, but I'm happy with it.    For home defense, the barrel is interchangeable with the mossberg 500 barrels, and you can buy an 18.5" cylinder bore barrel online for $90. That gives you a decent shotgun with 2 barrels for less than the remington or the stoeger
KFIPxAnBaa	Los datos que tenes vos son correctos. Brasil no tuvo marca en sus camisetas hasta Argentina 78. En general fue en ese mundial, o en del 82 que se hizo común la marca de ropa deportiva.<br>  Adidas viste a Alemania desde el 54, pero fue en el 70 que aparece por 1ra vez el logo y las tres tiras en la camiseta. Tambien es en el 70 el 1er mundial en que adidas provee la pelota oficial.<br>  Una anécdota interesante ocurrió en el mundial del 74. Holanda, la naranja mecánica tenia como proveedor de indumentaria a adidas, pero su jugador estrella, Johan Cruyff, tenía otro sponsor entonces su camiseta no llevaba 3 tiras sino 2. Algo impensado hoy en día, cuando por ejemplo en la publicidad de adidas aparece David Beckham con el short y las medias de la seleccion de Inglaterra, y se lee claramente "Umbro"...|`|9xxmBHSQaa	wallon|`|YUkbwkeGaa	Ya te respondieron, no llevaban marca ninguna.|`|rsNX7bdgaa	Seguramente salieron a la calle y compraron la primera que vieron.<br>  <br>  En realidad eso de que alguien vista a una selección empezó en 1978.<br>  <br>  Ya desde que Marx Spits gano siete medallas de oro en 1972 empezó a sacarle dinero a eso, lo criticaron hasta que se aburrieron pero algunos a?os después se convirtió en el modelo a seguir.

Q2sZhNmJaa	Robby, my favorite driver has driven Chevy, Ford, Dodge and now Toyota.  I think he will do well in a Toyota, heck he does well in anything with wheels.  With the Dodge last year I was surprised to see how well he did at Daytona and Dega.  I hope that the toyota offers a better and more compatible engine package for him.  He is great on road courses too, but needs to learn to stay out of people's way sometimes (I think he gets too cocky.)    Smoke, back in a chevy, thank gosh.  I think he will be happy this year, even if he does not win a lot of races.  This will be a learning year for him.  I do not think he will win the championship but I do believe he will make the chase and have a couple of wins.    In conclusion, I am looking forward to both boys racing (though I prefer Robby in a Dodge) and I think they will have fun this year|`|icTRTBAraa	You know Robby has really been trying many things to make his team work and this might be the right combination.  Smoke?  He is the owner now and has more things to juggle.  I think he will be extremely happy back with the Chevy program but Won't make the chase I think its going to be a challenge for him with his temper.  You know the Coach kept him reigned in all these years.  We will see.|`|rxCwaaG4aa	Tony is going to do well since he is essentially in a Hendrick car. Robby Gordon is the crappy driver he has always been, so he will get one top ten and that will be at one of the road course races. He is a perennial tail end runner. That's all he will ever be.|`|YPQTXOQ5aa	I think that Tony will win a couple of races and get into the Chase, he is that good of a driver.    As for Robby Gordon, I think that he will contend in the two road course races and will make his way into the top 25 in owner points. He has done a good job in keeping his car in the show.|`|1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	They will both do better than they did last year.  Tony will benefit from a change of scenery and Robby will get a lot more support from Toyota than he was getting from Ford and Dodge.  4's FINE N 09!!!!|`|DZPCCIgEaa	Robby Gordon in the Toyota might do well this year. He has not been doing that good at all as of lately. I'll give him until Phoenix to get all the quirks out and then he should do good.    Smoke in a Chevy... This is going to be a wild ride for this guy this year. Look out NASCAR fans Smoke is coming to get ya. Smoke will be a master to contend with this year!! His a man on a mission. This guy is the real deal!! Smoke will be in cup contention this year!!|`|Qw4l9R68aa	Tony is driving Haas cars he will not be competitive for awhile. Robby might even do better than Tony.

I like Trish too, but it wasn't until late in her career that she actually started doing some real wrestling. Before that, she was nothing but glorified eye candy.|`|IzgJpVgBaa	i wud love it if lita returned|`|lkw5ZyDIaa	you never know|`|gCG1uUafaa	I would like them both to come back.    But only if Lita comes back the with the attitude she had when she first came into it, i couldnt stand her last image with edge.|`|R9EMWco4aa	Maybe,Sometime!!!|`|l0GWmWl4aa	I would love to see Trish come back, but whats left to prove? She's the record holder for the Women's title and winning the Divas title would be a hollow victory. Same with Lita. The only thing I could see them doing is trying to boost the popularity of the Women's division.|`|dbc3503ab379d3f8b3803c2488ab5e36aa	I think it would be great to see, to bad Victoria retired I would've loved to see those go at it one more time.

El salto de altura tiene su parte complicada pero interesante. El jokey es demasiado agresivo y tal vez violento pero llama la atención para desahogarse. La escalada sin medidas de seguridad me resulta natural y compleja siendo a niveles de monta?a con alturas de menos de 50 metros lo que practico, sino supone una locura tremenda mientras que la otra se me hace demasiado complicada y los rocodromos tras un rato cansan.

v3gaNiZqaa	Claro puedes utilizar canciones para correr, lo recomendable es que sean de buen ritmo, puedes usar de música disco, de rock, también dependerá del ritmo al que quieras entrenar, puedes llevar música mas tranquila si quieres entrenar a ritmo mas tranquilo, recuerda también que el hacer esto te puede inhibir el sentido del oído por lo tanto lo recomendable es que lo hagas en un parque o pista donde no haya personas con bicicleta, vehículos, o riesgos de otro tipo como el que atraviese gente. esto te puede ayudar a completar tu entrenamiento con mayor amenidad.<br>  suerte|`|ouWy2J5Oaa	Jajajaja!!!<br>  <br>  Ta ta taan, ta ta tan, ta ta tan....<br>  <br>  No sé, yo correría con canciones como....<br>  <br>  "Holding Out For A Hero",<br>  "Lord Of The Rings",<br>  "Flashdance",<br>  "Hung Up",<br>  <br>  No sé... hacé lo que puedas.|`|QFDIATegaa	dancing with my self / billy idol|`|B8Hugq16aa	Aquellas canciones, que sean de tu grupo musical predilecto, en lo posible que no sean lentas.|`|QPZ9QPjkaa	What i want- Bob Sinclair,<br>  Think about the way- Ice mc,<br>  Fashionista,<br>  What a feeling,<br>  Las de flashdance,<br>  Me enamora remix- Juanes,<br>  It′s my life- Dr. Alban.|`|ogfEChyuaa	power mix ---dj tiesto.....o mejor aun puras rolas de dj tiesto te va a prender cuando estes corriendo....suerte!!!pazz|`|GSozzivfaa	Eso depende de que género te guste. En lo personal me inclino hacia "Dawn of Victory" de Rhapsody of Fire, "Demonheart" de Luca Turilli y "Where the rain grows" de Helloween. La primera para una sensación realmente victoriosa (No por nada se llama así, Amanecer de Victoria al espa?ol), la segunda por la persecusión a la que mentalmente te someterías y la última por relajación. Las tres son muy buenas.

BpY2ed0Gaa	I hate to say it, but the problem is that it's made by BE.   The BE AUG is an absolutely awful gun by anyone's standards.    If you clean the barrel properly and set up the hopup properly (if you can - I can't remember if it's a fixed hop on that AUG) it might help the accuracy somewhat. Just don't expect miracles, it's a poor gun and in all likelihood it won't last you too long anyway|`|Szf3UEVNaa	Get rid of it get another at airsplat or shorty usa or hot import oys.    dont buy another gun from that brand

Cuando un caballo va al "tranco", significa que va caminando. Por lo general, cuando uno no está muy diestro y quiere hacer que el caballo "galope" (o sea que corra), él se encapricha y te lleva al "trote" (corre despacito y dando saltitos).

I'd say just be patient with him and unless you can replace him with a legit #1 RB, don't trade him. Rudi Johnson is a #3/flex guy at best...|`|KWWXZrJQaa	Hey - you gotta get to the playoffs first.  How ya looking so far?  If you're strugglin' at all then you gotta stick with Gore.  Hell, Rudi may not even be back in week 6.  You never know with injuries.  Their will probably be more injuries this week so you can always hawk the FA's when your backs have their bye-week.  HOWEVER, if you're 3-1 or 4-0 then you may want to start looking at playoff strategies... that does look like a cake schedule.

Si bien es cierto que a veces no es tan conveniente, por comodidad, no salir a la cancha con maquillaje, u?as largas o cosas de ese tipo, no quiere decir que no nos guste.<br>  <br>  Sería como decir que una mujer por ir a trabajar, en vez de quedarse en casa haciendo el quehacer, deje de ser femenina. <br>  <br>  Es cuestión cultural.|`|zcWV80zraa	no por que el futbol no se hizo especificamente para los hombrres con practicar un deporte no pierdes nada creo que tu comentario si eres hombre es machista

He is a GREAT fantasy QB and is up against a Vikings defense that won't allow the run but give up big numbers on the pass, which is perfect for detroit since they love passing anyways<br>  <br>  WR - Seems like there's no issue here...<br>  <br>  RB - Steven Jackson, don't worry about last week, complete fluke. He will bounce back.  As for number 2, its either portis or jordan.  I would choose Portis since the Raiders are playing the Broncos, whose defense is tons better than the Lions, so dont expect Lamont to get similar numbers<br>  <br>  TE - After that poor outing from Vernon Davis, I would say Dallas Clark.  For now, sit vernon until he proves himself and has a good game. Until then, it's still risky<br>  <br>  Defense - Despite dallas's horrible outing against the giants, i would start them.  The vikings are good, but are weak against the pass, which is what detroit is best at.  The cowboys get to play Miami, which are just horrible as an offensive team.  They may very well be in the bottom 3 or 4 in the NFL as far as offense goes.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps and good luck
almGTWHvaa	New Orleans' offense HAS to rebound against Tampa Bay (one would think so, anyway), so Colston is probably a gimme. <br>  <br>  Generally I would say Coles over Edwards no matter the match-up, but given the status of Pennington's ankle and them playing the Ravens I would have a hard time starting Coles this week.<br>  <br>  I think the chances are more likely that Edwards has some production against the Bengals with whatever combination of Anderson and Quinn are throwing him the ball then Coles with Clemmens.<br>  <br>  Colston and Edwards.|`|bc7WsZcOaa	Coles & Colston|`|bua3rhAoaa	Coles and Edwards<br>  <br>  Cincinnati's defense isn't the greatest, Baltimore scored 20 points while committing a lot of turnovers so the Cincy D can't be that good.  Whomever the Browns put at QB They will be looking for Edwards to catch passes for over 12 yards. Winslow and Jurevicous are the posession receivers.<br>  <br>  Coles was up against a tough defense last week and scored twice.  Baltimore gave up 27 points despite having the ball as often as they did so they must not be as strong as in the past.|`|ekUFaxY9aa	Colston becuase he agiants a team that is nothingg anymore<br>  <br>  Coles becuase edwards has no QB

Joe Everyone that is supported now by every one who supports the military, listens to rap, and being a champion - hes a crowd favorite. He fights people who would were symbols of oppressing genres. Like the Great Khali and others who are portrayed as from other country's. <br>  <br>  Now he has been taken as turning semi heel as Orten and his rivalry heats up. He wouldn't be turning heel because of a rivalry, but because he will try to run over anyone who messes with his Dad. For instance William Regal was attacked repeatedly because of the matches he was quick to put them into. In Regals defence he did oppose something on Cena that he though he wanted. But still - Cena was mad, and Orten ran, of course.|`|PvmhjDcVaa	I kinda liked him as the Vanilla Ice wannabee, when he battle-rapped before his matches and stuff.

But true wrestling fans know this guy is a joke.  Absolutely no wrestling skills, no mic skills, and certainly one of the worst champions of all time.  That's why the true wrestling fans "boo" him.  They know the WWE is on a down period, and this is the best they can do.  Without Stone Cold or The Rock, Cena is the only one that will attract merchandise money with his goofy gimmick.  Hopefully someone beats this guy and ends the long reign of a joke of a champion!!|`|qEe8O3cTaa	I don't know, but I hope he loses the title soon

I'm 5'11", 165 lbs. and most coaches think I'd be a better running back or wideout than a linemen, but there are certain variables you have to consider. For some reason, and I don't know what, despite my size I can make it through (or hold back) a line. I once blocked a three man rush single handedly. Now that's a natural gift, and I am not so well suited for RB or WR. I have decent hands at best and poor running vision. So don't chalk up a position to your size alone, because alot more comes into play. I'd say take up a position you feel comfortable with and within a year or so it'll become clear what position you're cut out for.|`|1xmpTUuPaa	free safety|`|OkjHVfi3aa	I played football all thought high school and went to the state championsiph my senoir year.

Bi9q5xPaaa	TEMPLE:<br>  <br>  La resistencia psiquica se logra solamente entrenando la mente. Se nota mucho en las artes marciales pero todos los deportes fuerzan su mente para "no sentir" el dolor o el canzancio.<br>  <br>  Se logra con la practica, aguantando una picadura sin rascarse, no sentarse mientras se espera, saltaldo de un brinco ni bien te despertas (esta es la mas dificil), y lo mejor en tu caso es que corras y corras y trates de dar siempre un poco mas de todo lo que puedas. En karate nunca hay que aflojar hasta que la sangre ya no llega al cerebro y finalmente uno cae casi inconciente (en el mejor de los casos).<br>  <br>  <br>  En conclusion: <br>  <br>  Para lograr rendimiendo fisico, hay que entrenar el cuerpo... <br>  <br>  Para fortalecer la mente hay que autoflajelarse. <br>  SABER que es lo que te va a hacer da?o o no...

Carezco de trucos. Mi resistencia se basa en la constancia. <br>  <br>  Hasta hace un par de a?os no practicaba deporte. Sólo aisladamente. Por tanto, mi resistencia era nula. Sin embargo, decidí irme a correr a diario. Descansando un día por semana.<br>  <br>  Empecé con un par de vueltas a un circuito que supongo que tendría unos seiscientos metros. Puesto que era un parque mayor que una pista de atletismo, pero tampoco mucho más. Poco a poco, y de forma continuada, iba aumentando el trayecto. Eso sí, a veces, corría un poco más o un poco menos según me sintiese de fuerzas. Lo que siempre hacía y, de hecho, sigo haciendo es calentar y realizar estiramientos.<br>  <br>  A día de hoy, soy capaz de correr sin parar en un partido de fútbol sala de hora y media. Deporte que estoy practicando con frecuencia. Subo para atacar y bajo a defender. Acabo cansado, por supuesto, pero tengo fondo hasta el último momento. De hecho, se nota y son esos últimos momentos donde más aprovecho la resistencia que he adquirido.<br>  <br>  En cuanto al aspecto psicológico que acertadamente comentas, ya que ciértamente es relevante, decirte un par de cosas.

GrUegc64aa	Wow - you HAVE to start Jacobs. <br>  <br>  First of all, when its RB vs. WR, the RB usually has a bit of an advantage already. <br>  <br>  Secondly, Derrick Ward has been missing practices this week. With a stud back like Jacobs, do you think they're going to give a ton of carries to Ward? I don't. <br>  <br>  Finally, even when he is splitting carries, Jacobs can be a high points scorer. Look at last week - without fumbles, he would have had 16 points - maybe more if those drives had turned into TDs for him. <br>  <br>  Jacobs. Do it.|`|7eDaR2AGaa	Bobby Engram all the way.

Después de que la WWF lo patrocinara en los juegos olímpicos de Atlanta 96, firmó un contrato de diez a?os, algo poco comun en el Wrestling profesional. Fue entrenado por Stu y Bret Hart, su primer feudo en la WWF fue con Jerry "The King" Lawler, quién habló duramente de Henry en Monday Night RAW en Marzo. En Summerslam 1996, Henry interfirió en el combate entre Jake Roberts y Jerry Lawler, ayudando a Roberts, quien estaba sufriendo en manos de Lawler. Su primer combate televisado fue en In Your House: Mind Games en el 22 de Septiembre de 1996, donde Henry venció a Lawler.<br>  <br>  Henry se unió a la Nation of Domination en 1997, donde estaba aliado con The Rock. Después de que esa facción se disolviera, se alió con D'Lo Brown, con quién formó un tag team. Durante un combate de Summerslam 1999 entre D'lo y Jeff Jarrett por el WWF Intercontinental Champioship y el WWF European Championship (los dos eran de D'Lo), Henry se volvió en contra de D'Lo y ayudó a Jarrett, ganando este útimo el combate y los títulos. La noche siguiente, Jarrett le dio el European title a Henry.<br>  <br>  Henry ganó popularidad con el nick de "Sexual Chocolate", el nombre fue copiado de una banda ficticia de de funk que aparecía en la película [[Coming to America]]. Después de esto, Mark Henry fue visto con mujeres de la WWF desde Chyna hasta Mae Young. él tuvo un feudo con Víscera como parte de la Storyline en la que Víscera le hacía un big spalash a Mae Young cuando llevaba al hijo de Henry. Aparte de esto, Henry formó parte de otras infames Storylines, incluyendo el tener relaciones sexuales con un hombre travestido (desconocido por Henry todo el tiempo) la admisión de ser adicto al sexo, y que su primera experiencia sexual fue con su hermana.<br>  <br>  En 2000, Henry fue enviado a la OVW (Ohio Valley Wrestling) para mejorar su condición y sus técnicas. Mas tarde en ese mismo a?o, paró de hacer sus labores de wrestler para concentrarse en el levantamiento de pesas, y en el 23 de Febrero de 2002, ganó una competición de strongman, durante el Arnold Classic en Columbus, Ohio recibiendo un Humvee<br>  hi te va un pedaso de su historia|`|H31UrHGQaa	por que gano una competicion 3 veces sobre ese torneo|`|HBynkNskaa	Henry fue coronado como "el hombre más fuerte del mundo" después de clasificarse para la competición de levantamiento de pesas de las olimpiadas de Barcelona 92, donde acabó décimo en la clase de Súper Peso Pesado.|`|UY9LtlLxaa	porque creo que en 1997 fue el hobre mas fuerte del mundo o algo asi espero aberte ayudado|`|Znvpajj1aa	porque participó en las olimpiadas de Barcelona 92 y es ganador de la competición Arnold Strongman convirtiendose así en el hombre más fuerte del mundo|`|nILRh2Veaa	fue levantador de pesas olímpicos y participo y gano en los torneos del hombre mas fuerte del mundo por eso el sobrenombre HAVE NICE DAY|`|pZ4fG4Voaa	El apodo surgió como referencia a su pasado como levantador de pesas olimpico, y su triunfo en la competición Arnold Classic Strongman (una competencia de fisico culturismo).<br>  La wwe basado en eso formó su personaje (como pasaría con Kurt Angle, cuyo perosnaje siempre habla de su medalla ganada en los juegos olimpicos).<br>  Igual ya pasaron mas de 10 a?os desde todo esto, así que estoy de acuerdo contigo acerca de que no creo que sea el hombre mas fuerte^_^|`|qhmcK2z9aa	por que gano la competicion llamada el hombre mas fuerte del mundo|`|s4bHDSOgaa	En una olimpiado fue nombrado asi pero ya no lo es|`|tgi34Q0Taa	Porque en la misma olimpiada en la que gano kurt angle su medalla olimpica mark henry gano el concurso del hombre mas fuerte del mundo.|`|zGEuogpeaa	porq en realidad lo fue en 1996 creo pero si te vas a su biografia o algo de acerca de el ahi veras su record y veras q si lo fue

Fasuba y ayudado por un viento favorable de 1,7 m/s, y tras una gran progresión en la segunda mitad de la carrera rebajó el tope universal hasta los 9.76 para borrar a Powell del tope de la lista mundial.<br>  <br>  Fasuba acabó en la segunda posición con un tiempo de 9.84, nuevo récord de Africa, y el también estadounidense Shawn Crawford, tercero, ya no pudo bajar de los diez segundos (10.08).|`|3I4CzlTVaa	Prueba  Marca  Atleta  Fecha  Lugar<br>  100 m  9,74  Asafa Powell (Jamaica)  09/09/2007  Rieti, Italia<br>  200 m  19,32  Michael Johnson (Estados Unidos)  01/08/1996  Atlanta Estados Unidos|`|AmZJZA93aa	no yo sí aguanto.<br>  <br>  Duro contra el racismo!!!|`|Sni697ICaa	100 m 9,74 Asafa Powell (Jamaica) 09/09/2007 Rieti, Italia<br>  200 m 19,32 Michael Johnson (Estados Unidos) 01/08/1996 Atlanta Estados Unidos|`|ERXY6z6xaa	a pie.... o en vehiculo.... o en que...<br>  <br>  a pie... carl lewis 100 mts planos 9.5 segundos 197 y algo|`|IqIEeXTQaa	no se ni idea|`|jMEZfB9Laa	no se entiende tu pregunta|`|c6ffe04c52e1620bdf3465a65e1b570daa	por lo general se considera al mas veloz del mundo, al que posee el record mundial en 100 mts planos, que en este caso sería Asafa Powell (jamaica) 9.74<br>  <br>  pero como tu pregunta no es completa <br>  quizas quieras saber solo la máxima velocidad alcanzada por cualquier persona en un tramo ya sea corto o largo<br>  se dice que Carl Lewis podia correr en 9.0 los 100 cuando corria en relevos (pero ya venia con velocidad) lo mismo sucede con Michael Johnson en donde es probable que cuando impuso el record de 200 los 2dos 100 eran impresionantes.<br>  <br>  hay atletas que son formidables entre los 60 y los 80 mts. caso Justin Gatlin (usa) o Donovan Bailey (can) ex-recordistas mundiales|`|QFDIATegaa	asafa powell 9.74 record mundial en 100 mts.<br>  incluso pudo hacer menos (se solto los últimos metros)

Son las que trabajan mucho rato y suelen ocupar las capas internas. Tenderás a adelgazar si no comes mucho carbohidrato antes de entrenar. Bebe mucha agua.<br>  <br>  Y en el segundo caso, tendrás que entrenar más la fuerza muscular "rápida", la de las fibras blancas. Si comes bien y sobre todo, suficiente proteína, no sólo no adelgazarás sino que subirás de peso. Pero recuerda que el músculo pesa más que la grasa y aunque la báscula te diga que has engordado, tú puedes verte más delgada. En este caso, la tonificación muscular se notará más a simple vista y te dará un aspecto fibroso.<br>  <br>  En cualquiera de los dos casos, lo más probable es que tu peso quede más o menos igual aunque te veas más delgada. No te preocupes, es mejor pesar de músculo que de grasa.<br>  <br>  Pero si de verdad te preocupa, por estética, verte más delgada, te aconsejo que hagas el segundo tipo de ejercicio. Aunque si quieres entrenar para competir, tendrás que ser completa.<br>  <br>  Otro consejo es que entrenes con pesas para aumentar el volumen muscular, pero recuerda: perderás eficacia en las pruebas de resistencia.|`|KI9aaCWTaa	puedes ir al gymnasio 3 veces por semana para que agarres buen tono muscular.   y mas el atletismo uuu se forma una figura??|`|fo6llKVWaa	Hola, pues si eres chaparrita, pues sin broncas, se te va a ver mejor, pero si estás medio alta puede verse..... extra?o

But, for competitive running, you got to put in the mileage and time. <br>  <br>  Even with a minimal amount of training, they should be able to finish, but I would recommend to them that they have a physical before they run, especially since you mention they are unhealthy.|`|Tqvntouoaa	pretty farfetched.running once a week is not enough.you need to run at least three times a week.and since you say they are unhealthy,it sounds impossible that they will be able to run a 14 mile marathon in two months.the odds are against them!|`|e0Z5PHKmaa	While at training, try running for 14 miles without a break. Or as much as you can. Under 2 months,just on Sundays, it won't work. The problem is endurance and stamina.

Los especialistas coinciden en que la prueba de los cinco mil metros, protagonizada en Helsinki por Zátopek, fue la más fascinante en la historia mundial de esta disciplina. <br>  <br>  A finales de los anos cuarenta y en la primera mitad de los cincuenta, Emil Zátopek batió 18 récords mundiales en pruebas de fondo. En 1949, 1951 y 1952 le fue otorgado el título de Mejor Deportista del Mundo. Zátopek fue también tricampeón de Europa en pruebas de fondo. El atleta checo debía sus fabulosos éxitos a un original método de entrenamiento que exigía una excepcional tenacidad. <br>  <br>  Para convertirse en atleta de temple de acero, Emil Zátopek entrenaba todos los días la carrera de los diez mil metros, dividida en etapas. Primero realizaba cinco carreras de 200 metros, luego veinte recorridos de 400 metros, y finalmente otras cinco carreras de 200 metros. El atleta solía también alternar carreras veloces de 100 o 200 metros con trotes en la misma distancia. <br>  <br>  Emil Zátopek que el ano pasado obtuvo de la Asociación Checa de Atletismo el título de Atleta del Siglo, es una personalidad excepcional también en otro aspecto: como autodidacta aprendió el inglés, el alemán, el ruso, el polaco y el francés. Conoce también algo del espanol y concedió incluso una entrevistra en finlandés."|`|suYBY1lraa	El futbolista Pele|`|wI6ekYbqaa	Carl Lewis.|`|3I4CzlTVaa	para mi son estos:<br>  Michael phelps - natacion<br>  Lance Armstrong - ciclismo<br>  carl lewis - atletismo<br>  pele - futbol<br>  michael jordan - baloncesto|`|5l2hoP1Caa	Michael jordan, <br>  <br>  comprobado los mejores deportistas actuales lo mencionan a el como su idolo.|`|HvxJ0S8faa	para mi los mejores deportistas son jugadores de futbol                                                                                                para mi jugaba bien maradona y pele<br>  y ahora juega muy bien ronahaldhino y messi|`|KauINAPiaa	si es de nuestros tiempo me parece que Serguei Bubka, es un ucraniano que practicaba el salto con pertiga, en sus tiempos no tenia rivales, tiene el record en esa rama y aun despues de mucho tiempo separado del deporte activo tan siquiera se estan acercando las nuevas generaciones a esas marcas aun con todo el desarrollo tecnologico a favor del deporte que hay en estos dias, el se dedicaba a romper sus propios records, no habia ni hay competencia para el.

qfVE2KFtaa	Believe it or not Tony Romo is still a very good QB and the Cowboys would be crazy to let him go,granted he needs to grow a part and take charge but I would keep him.|`|khU8m4gxaa	Brett Favre was home watching the playoffs this year, just like Romo. Plus he's 10 years older (at least). He brought the Jets down the last month of the season and got the coach fired. Favre's not getting Dallas to the big game. I'm all for dumping coach Phillips though. Demote him to defensive coordinator & get a Shanahan or Cowher. Tony & the rest of the team just needs someone to kick them in the a** a little. Underachievers...|`|mTSOJKlyaa	perhaps you havent been paying much attention to the NFL, but as much as i respect favre and his accomplishments, as of late, his habit of throwing the ball to the other team should not be overlooked|`|6Ojpl6viaa	Get rid of the Choker for somebody that stays in the game, cant give it his best, cant make up his mind, and is getting old...sure go for it.

Brett is an overrated interception machine who is selfish and only cares about himself.  Ask the Jets teamates, he did not associate with the players, didn't come to the team dinners, and he was not liked and unless he's all in next year, they don't want him back. I mean when he decided to play despite having a TORN BICEP the 2nd half of the year!! he hurt the Jets so badly and just kept playing because he only cares about himself and his record.  Dallas does not need that controversey because they have a ton already and Romo is a beast|`|bgIbbp5Yaa	Talk was that the Cowboys were looking at hiring Dan Reeves (the ex-Falcon and Bronco coach) as an adviser. The Chargers had shown interest in hiring Reeves as offensive coordinator in hope of trying to lure Michael Vick to come to San Diego. But if Reeves is hired in Dallas, I wouldn't be suprised if they target Vick, once he gets out of jail.    Good Luck!!|`|S8qzG9HMaa	brett farve is an old man though|`|kE2n7HXcaa	This would just be another example of the Cowboys abandoning the home-grown talent (Romo) for a high priced prima donna (Favre).  Favre hasn't exactly excelled under pressure lately.  And while the bloom is off of Romo's rose right now, the Cowboys have way too much locker room turmoil to add another high-maintenance mess to the mix.      Romo isn't all-world, but he's a very solid quarterback.  The Cowboys should find a young QB in the third or fourth round this year as a long-term project (Graham Harrell perhaps?) and stay away from Brett and his drama.|`|yper8qYoaa	NO|`|icTRTBAraa	Favre is out and Romo is on his way up.  No disrespect for Favre but he has seen better days.|`|HfH7mARHaa	Is this a serious question? I am a Giants fan and would love to see Jerry get antsy and dump Romo for Favre. Outside of Al Davis he is probably the only owner/GM/head coach/groundskeeper that is dumb enough to do it!|`|AA10896470	Why? You're basically getting an older Romo if you did. Both had the same results the past 2 seasons. Both made a dumb mistake to get eliminated from the playoffs by the Giants in 08 and neither of them got their teams to the playoffs this past season. And as for Brett not choking, have you been paying attention??? He's the MAIN reason why his team is sitting at home.
t9jz9tMqaa	To answer your question I think he didn't cheat intentionally.  He would have won either way but wrong is wrong.  You break a rule you pay the price.  It gave GSP an unfair advantage.    He should be given a hefty fine $50,000 -$100,000.|`|BNqbOfBsaa	Yeah its tough. BJ depends SO MUCH on his jiu jitsu. And if GSP has vaselin on than someone needs to get fired! I like GSP but I am just dissapointed that he put himself in this position. His corner should know better! Even if it got wiped off! It should never have been wiped on in the first place|`|kWjy7uzAaa	haha you guys are acting like Vaseline is Radioactive gamma matter that gives you super ninja turtle powers. I agree it was shady and illegal, but I don't think it affected the fight itself at all, specially since the commission caught it in between the rounds and rubbed it off.  I think the rules of MMA should never be broken or over looked no matter how minor they seem. GSP won that fight in very dominantly I don't think BJ Penn would even be interested in a rematch. GSP won that fight and you cant take that away from him because of Vaseline.      If you still don't believe me go to Hailo Hawaii, rub yourself down in Va saline and Challenge BJ Penn to a fight and see if you also win.|`|sXMrY3uwaa	If the pics tell the truth, and Penns trainers really saw this 2 or 3 times between rounds then I am ashamed to be a GSP fan... I can't believe he'd do that, he probably had the clear edge even w/out the da*n vaseline... What a moronic move|`|925b7a5199b1427ca918a36c1cc68a1baa	The real question is whether the outcome would be different.  I don't think so, but the other issue is whether it was illegal.  The answer is yes.  GSP was already the better fighter, so giving even a 3% advantage to GSP is wrong.  Wrong is wrong, so hopefully this stuff stops.|`|gBO908P6aa	Holy Moses talk about grasping at straws.  Ok so it's illegal but GSP wasn't bathed in that stuff like A-1 steak sauce on a piece of grilled steak.  I can think of the many times where sweat alone played an even more major role in slippage.  If a small smudge of Vaseline was indeed so incredible, hell I'd put some on and defeat BJ Penn myself.  GSP also had some great great Muay Thai skills that could have stopped BJ alone, thanks to Kru Nurse.  Give him credit for that at least.     I can see the TV ads now -     Vaseline: Insta-MMA Fighter gel in 22oz bottle!  Buy now for just three easy payments of $19.95.|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	Anyone who watched that fight will tell you that no he didn't and he didn't need to. He whomped BJ's butt...plain and simple.|`|5t1140Ucaa	GSP would have won anyway???  In a team sport, if you play an inelligible player, the game is forfiet even if you would have won anyway.    Fighting for sport should have some integrity, and if we allow cheating, then perhaps the rules should be changed to allow that cheating, correct?  BUT, until we change the rules, violation of the rules as it stands is cheating.    GSP should be disqualified, and he should be suspended with his purse forfieted.    I suggest that GSP be stripped of his title, and let us allow some fighters who are HONEST compete for it.    The punishment should not be harsh if other fighters did not point out that GSP was slippery before.|`|7y6HneiBaa	I was also very shocked when i found this out but i dont think it would of changed the outcome of the fight. If you watched prime time u can see that penn did not train as hard as gsp and that he took to many vacations and spoke to much crap. now that he didn't back up the crap he spoke he looked bad. now he want to cover it all up and say that the vaseline helped gsp win the fight. that idiotic cause vaseline doesn't give much of advantage but yes if it was a intentional move on gsp's corner then it is illegal but either way the fight outcome wouldn't of changed. and look at gsp he is stronger, more physically fit, and is a great at mma. im not saying that penn isn't but they are on 2 different levels of greatness. hopefully this doesn't ruin gsp's career but there should be some kind of a fine or something for the violation.

Yslq4OYhaa	Yes it is a good martial arts to learn. Yes there is a belt system. Other are correct in saying that the belt system that many Japanese martial arts use started with Judo. Like any other art it takes a lifetime to master. Earning a black belt does not make you a master. Progressing in the art is determined by several things. How many days a week do you practice, how hard do you workout, how well you learn the Japanese (there is a written test), how well do you apply what is being taught and do you have a good instructor? This is just a short list of variable as to promotion and or progression.    All people learn at different rates. Some people have a natural adaptation to learn martial arts.|`|AA10860409	Yes. Learning it saved my life a few times. And it's a good sport.|`|LnJjS8BRaa	Judo can be very effective. Train hard and you'll have excellent throws, sweeps and takedowns with a solid ground game.     Just a little factoid, the belt system actually originated with Judo.|`|edw0CUSaaa	There's a 2nd Dan judoka who comes to our jujitsu club and training with him on several occasions improved my throwing technique 10-fold; it had to because it was like trying to move a tree!!! I'd say it's defintely a great martial art to take.|`|WAO7RuCwaa	First of all, effectiveness in the MMA ring is not the defining mark of a good art. That being said, judo is a great martial art to learn, but is not for everyone. Some background, judo is descended from the martial art of jujutsu. Jujutsu was the unarmed combat system of the samurai of feudal Japan. Because of the nature of Japanese armor, jujutsu emphasizes throws and grappling as opposed to strikes. Over time, Jujutsu began being taught in its own right, often coupled with weapon arts (sword, staff, etc). Kano Jigoro Sensei was a student of several different styles of jujutsu, and founded judo as his own personal style of jujutsu. Judo developed a sport aspect as well. In current practice, the lethal techniques of jujutsu, as well as things like eye gouges and hair pulls are only taught to judokas as part of their kata. The art has been simplified to throwing and ground fighting. Early judo was very balanced between the two parts, however rule changes have made modern judo very throw heavy (for a look at the other extreme, Brazilian Jujitsu was developed from early judo, and developed into a very ground fighting based art). If you do not want to be throwing people around (and being thrown yourself, which means quite a bit of falling), then Judo is probably not your cup of tea. If you do not mind some bumps and bruises, then by all means take up this wonderful art. Regarding belts... Judo uses them (and, as has been pointed out already, Kano Sensei was the first to use a system of colored belts to identify the different ranks). With regard to "mastering" judo, it takes a lifetime to master an art, but I assume that you are really asking how long it takes to earn dan ranking (a black belt). It depends on your sensei and your school, but I would expect it to take between three and four years to reach shodan (first degree black belt). That being said, shodan is the beginning of the journey, not the destination.|`|yRlfm4oPaa	as good as any as long as the boys are hot|`|73wpIlgnaa	most definitely.  go ahead and try it.  by the way: the creator of Judo is the one who CREATED the belt system that is used in so many martial art styles|`|6wSmZrrsaa	Probably the most useful in a real street fight. Imagine if you threw someone onto the street or cement with a judo throw, they'd be done son|`|fFqzD3aMaa	Yes, it is one of the few martial arts that actually help you defend yourself. Mastery takes several years, but you will experience the benefits immediately.|`|ojCdRHGHaa	I don't take Judo, but I do know it's useful. A good martial art to take is Modern American Kenpo. It teaches you how to defend against modern scenarios, like muggings and against guns.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	Yes it's good. I consider it a little too sporty for my personal liking, but it is a good art. Judo came from Jujitsu if I'm not mistaken.
pANpZ3vaaa	In order of most to least loved  for me:    1. Steelers  2. Eagles  3. Panthers   4. Rams    Eagles will be great next season and have a good chance to go deep in the playoffs|`|UQYurvnYaa	steelers. no the eagles will not be winning a superbowl any time soon|`|UxooffHZaa	The Steelers. But, hey, it's not hockey. I like the Eagles too, and think they'll win a Super Bowl. They're a good team, and I find it amazing they've Never won one. McNabb has another good 5 years in him, so I think he'll win one in the next 5. Particularly if they can pick up TJ Houchmanzadah in the off-season. One thing we really noticed in the playoff loss, was that the Eagles need more speed in the WR position. McNabb deserves a WR of Housh's caliber. . . And there's nobody else available who is anywhere near that level of play. . . Deverey Henderson maybe? I doubt he'd improve their WR core much.|`|p4H61jQDaa	The eagles baby, than the stealers, panthers, then the rams.    Eagles and steelers have solid shots at the super bowl next season.  Eagles should have been there this season with the steelers.  Eagles need a couple OT, another RB, a future replacement for Dawkins and a TE or WR. they are solid in all the skill positions and need a little tweaking here or there for them to be the favorite.     BRING IN TJ HOOSHMANZADA|`|sMssDP1Xaa	Steelers.    I don't think so with Andy Reid as coach.|`|lPDHMOVZaa	Out of those 4:    Panthers  Eagles  Steelers  Rams    The Eagles definitely got a shot in the near future... however, if they don't get one in the next 2-3 years it might be a while... Westbrook isn't getting any younger and McNabb can only take so much hate from his home town fans.|`|S8qzG9HMaa	eagles|`|AA10188905	Out of those teams, Eagles. And yes, I think a super bowl is possible next season as long as they keep mcnabb and draft a tall wr in the first 2 rounds. They came really close this season to the Super Bowl.|`|jhNUuz0maa	I am and always will be a Steeler fan.    I think the Eagles could get there and win. They came pretty close this year.|`|2d30854bec7b4d3aa1bb8af4207bdf4baa	STEELERS, baby!  The Eagles have a shot at it. With the teams in their division I think they have a pretty good shot as long as they don't play the Steelers!!|`|C290wQWGaa	Steelers fan since 1995  I|`|h9h1LQNSaa	I like both the steelers and the eagles thats why i was hoping they would both make it.  And i do think its possible they need to get a go to receiver, and maybe start getting some young defensive players to start getting ready to replace the older ones. And they also have to keep Mcnabb there.|`|u4cvAPtNaa	EEEEEEEEAgles!! your lucky the eagles didn't make it to the super bowl because they would have owned the steelers just like they did earlier in the season!

EKmheW8raa	la diferencia la hace la velocidad y el estado físico, antes era como jugar al TETRIS, el video juego que caen figuras y deben hacer líneas con ellas... antes se jugaba a nivel uno de velocidad, ahora  al nivel máximo... y si te dejan pensar y no te marcan, cualquiera es hábil. y todos recuerdan a los genios, a los Pelé, nadie a los troncos pega-patadas. y eran muchos.<br>  y pegar se pegó siempre, incluso más, por no había tarjetas amarillas y rojas, ni se penaba pegar de atrás... y lo dice un viejo que ve fútbol desde 1952,y que jugó muy buen fútbol toda su vida y lo ama. y un equipo bueno de ahora, a uno bueno de 50 a?os atrás, lo destroza, sobre todo en el segundo tiempo por potencia y estado físico... <br>  y ganas de jugar se puso siempre, también se ganaba buena plata, no las fortunas de ahora... otra cosa es que me digan el fútbol aficionado, en los potreros...<br>  ciencionsecalla.blogspot.com|`|5R6D8HIiaa	En la época de Pelé, Garrincha que hacian muchos goles.Qué epoca,saludos|`|A7Hn4m1naa	imaginate si llega arias a la seleccion <br>  creo yo que el mejorm futbol del mundo es el de la liga inglesa por que si checas los defensas son muy duros y altos y aun asi se ven marcadores abultados en especial? cuando juega el man utd o el chelsea y hace un par de temporadas que decir del arsenal|`|BGuH49PCaa	Es verdad, el fútbol ahora no es como antes; porque? muy fácil antes se jugaba por amor al fútbol y ahora, ahora que se juega por amor al dinero, y solo se juega con muchos defensas en donde el fútbol no se ha desarrollado en totalidad hay que darle tiempo al tiempo...|`|d8514f0d77ef81cc6126047804f5488aaa	Por supuesto, antes era un DEPORTE...con letras mayores...hoy es solo un comercio..tanto para los jugadores como para las hinchadas.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  CG|`|ngEmahzjaa	compa la neta y yo te pregunto a ti no es mas bonito alguien que si sepa hablar de futbol no te parece entonces si kieres 6 o 7 delanteros aver por que en la pasada copa del mundo la gano italia por ke juega con un esquema muy defensivo tanto asi que en todo el torneo se le llego a notar solamente 2 goles y 1 fue autogol y el otro de penal imaginate igual necaxa es la segunda mejor defensiva eso es saver jugar weyes como tu no deverian estar aki hablan puras estupideses sin fundamento|`|L4oPpmfJaa	El fútbol sigue siendo bonito. Creo que no es culpa del sistema, del negocio, ni de las estrategias que los marcadores sean abultados y tengamos que perder 90 minutos viendo partidos aburridos. <br>  <br>  El fútbol, en su naturaleza deportiva, es un juego limpio. Pero hoy se juega sucio, salvando a millares de jugadores profesionales y amateurs, con tal de querer ganar. Entonces, la responsabilidad es compartida por todos los que nos gusta el fútbol. Hay que reconocer que el espectáculo nos gusta, como hace siglos le gustaban a los romanos en el circo depredador o el Coliseo.<br>  <br>  Si vas por un parque y ves ni?os jugando, te asombrarás que todavía practican dominio de balón sin dejarla caer, voleas, bicicletas, goles de taco, chilenas, goles olímpicos, túneles, driblings, gambetas, tiros libres, sombreritos... ?y lo hacen en serio! <br>  <br>  Si ves cualquier liga profesional de fútbol ves otra cosa: carreras, gritos, gestos violentos, escupitazos, botellazos, golpes, patadas y hasta sangre, botellas, cuchillos, pistolas y muerte. ?La plata tiene que ver? Sí, sin duda alguna. También los tenebrosos negocios y mafias superorganizadas detrás de cada anuncio publicitario, de cada campeonato, de cada sorteo, y podríamos ensanchar la lista.<br>  <br>  Evidentemente, que el fútbol de ayer era distinto. No tiene que ver con la técnica, ni que eran los jugadores más o menos rápidos o fuertes, o que el balón era más pesado. No, la diferencia estriba en que el futbolista jugaba de corazón, como la haría un ni?o. Incluso, hace 60 a?os, los futbolistas que integraban al menos las naciones de Brasil y Argentina, Colombia y Uruguay (aparte de ser seleccionado nacional y jugar en clubes) trabajaban en fábricas y canteras para llevar el pan a la casa. No sabían que era eso de "futbolista rentado que no trabaja sino que solo entrena".<br>  <br>  Uno de los mejores futbolistas dijo en su discurso de despedida: "Chicos, la pelota es blanca, la pelota es limpia. Jueguen y diviértanse. El fútbol es bueno". <br>  <br>  Somos nosotros, cada uno, quienes debemos cambiar. Yo fuí futbolista profesional durante unos buenos a?os, y sigo ense?ando a mis hijos los mejores trucos para dominar el balón y regatear, esquivando patadones. Les ense?o a dormir la pelota en la frente, o en el cuello. Y les digo quiénes son ejemplares fuera y dentro de la cancha.<br>  <br>  El fútbol es distinto, y ma?ana seguirá cambiando. Marquemos nosotros la diferencia.|`|ReFtqTsWaa	spor ke el futboll antes eraa un psatiempo para las familias ahora se ha convertido en un negocio :(-....<br>  <br>  todo por el diner dinero dinero dinero dinero....|`|q6OzOz26aa	su lo era por el rey pele y maradona y el pibe

925b7a5199b1427ca918a36c1cc68a1baa	I don't think Penn himself will protest.  If Penn's team is smart, they will stick with the lower weight division.  Penn won't win regardless of grease or no grease.      However, GSP needs to talk to his people because they are professionals and should abide by all the rules.  This could cost GSP if this happens against Anderson Silva.  Serra complained about the same thing, so it is evident that GSP's team needs to make sure they comply.  Now GSP will have to watch every little detail because big brother will be watching.

vea6mqPZaa	I would go with a shotgun.  A pump shotgun has a sound when the action is worked that will make most evil-doers wet themselves.    Depending on your stature and body weight I would look at the following two or three.    Mossberg 500 12 guage or 20 guage    Charles Daly 20 guage youth model    Remington 870 youth model 12 or 20 guage    You will notice I keep stating youth models  The only reason is they are shorter and thus easier to move with.    You will then want to learn to use it while laying down.    The goal, in my opinion is to lie in wait.    Lay down next to the bed and when the bad guy comes in blast his feet, and ankles. He/she is then down and you have control.|`|BCebZRu3aa	If I were you, I would get a snub-nose .38 revolver rated for +P ammunition. The +P rounds are a higher pressure and more powerful round, not as powerful as the .357 (which is too much for an inexperienced shooter) but more powerful than the regular .38 special round. You can still use the less powerful .38 special round for practice, though. Just be sure the gun is rated for +P ammo. It usually is indicated on the barrel in most new .38 revolvers.   The reason I recommend revolvers over semiautomatic pistols are ease of use. There is no safeties or magazine releases or decockers etc to worry about. It is a point and shoot gun. Also, they almost never jam. Modern semiautos rarely jam, but a revolver is even less likely to jam in an emergency situation.   I have included a couple of links to some good Smith & Wesson revolver. They are a little pricey, but you can find cheaper ones from Ruger and Charter Arms. They are just as reliable, but a good deal cheaper.|`|itiLu3dRaa	A shot gun is a poor choice because it is hard to manage in close quarters and difficult to control when you fire it.

Many consequences will come from shooting someone and you will have to live with those . I owned a revolver and thats what i reccomend you buy . Maybe a .38 cal. revolver like police use . Revolvers are reliable and esay to clean and operate . Contact police in your area as to gun ownership and whats needed to buy one in your area . Good luck !|`|AA10552262	Hard to argue with the logic of going with a shotgun. I was an police firearms instructor for several years. I properly fitting shotgun, like the Mossberg or Winchester or Remington with a youth-size stock (generally available from the factory as standard issue at no extra cost) is the way to go. Stay with a 20 gauge. Ammo is cheap and plentiful at WalMart. Get someone to take you to a range and try it out. I read many heart-warming reports of little old ladies having a gun in the house for 40 years and never firing it until it was time to send a burglar to his eternal reward. However, most likely even, without at least a little training it will become an albatross to you. Have you considered moving to a safer locale?

Do yourself justice.|`|9UUEhAYtaa	Do you want a home defense gun or a concealed carry gun? if you just want a gun to keep at home, get a shotgun. i would recommend a mossberg 500 pump. as stated earlier, the sound of a pump action will usually scare away a would-be criminal. if you use a shotgun you don't have to worry as much about hitting your target.     if you want a concealed carry gun, i would suggest a revolver, but a good auto pistol would suffice. i know a lot of females that prefer smaller calibers like .32 and .380, but if you feel up to it you could get a 9mm or even a .45 just ask the guys at your GUN STORE, not pawn shop, what would be good for a woman of your build. by the way, you will need a license if you want to carry.    most important of all, make sure your young-un knows the danger of a firearm and when they're old enough, probably 8 or 9, how to use one safely. good luck and God bless you.

If you're going to keep it loaded, either put a dummy round ( a fake plastic round) in the chamber or don't put one at all, and dryfire it. That way you can pump a round into the chamber without having to push the little button that keeps you from pumping if you haven't pulled the trigger.|`|AS5bLez1aa	First thing I would do is go to a firearms instructor take classes and get his or her opinion on what to do.If you are afraid of guns my advice is to get education or stay away from them.The person pulling a trigger has got to be very confident on what they are doing.Shooting at a range can help overcome that fear but you need to shoot on a regular basis to do so.As far as a gun a compact 9mm or a .380 are a good choice, again go to a reputable gun dealer for that choice.If you make the decision to buy a gun and do so go shoot 50 rounds or so right off the bat.Then continue to practice, this is something not to take lightly guns need to be respected and the person pulling the trigger needs to be very aware what they are doing.Good luck!|`|cmvPENvoaa	you cant go wrong with a short 18.5" barrel  remington 870 shotgun. is over penetration a problem? if it is i would recommend no. 6 shot in a 2 3/4" shell. this will do fine at most inside ranges.  forget about the notion of firing a 4 foot shot pattern down your hallway and not aiming. that is hollywood, you must still aim with a shotgun. at close ranges inside your house the shot column would only be about 2-3 inches in diameter.  practice, practice, practice! until you are comfortable and that shotgun seems like an extension of your arms. it does no good if you are so inexperienced with your gun you cant use it.    finally, you shouldnt have in problems as long as you are not a felon.|`|t6sDVUI4aa	I would either say a shotgun or a revolver. There are pros and cons to both. So I will list them    Shotgun Pros   Intimidating, the click of a pump is unique.  Can fire less than lethal ammuntion IE bean bags  Large mag capacity  Ammo easily available and lots of choices  Easy to use and aim just point it    Shotgun Cons  They can kick hard  They are harder to hide. Keep the kids out of them  Harder to load quickly   Can't carry them outside the house    Double Action/Single Action Revolver Pros  Easy to use Just pull the trigger  Will always fire regardless of how long since you've maintained it  Unlike semis they do not jam ever  Available in a wide variety of sizes to fit any hands  Easy to hide that means you can carry them      Double Action/Single Action Revolver Cons  Need permits and licenses in many areas  Ammo can over penetrate so you need to pay more attention to your loads  Harder to aim requires more skill.    There is no reason to be afraid of guns. They are no different than a kitchen knife. A tool to be respected. But a self defense gun carries with it special legal responsibilities and they vary widely. So a self defense class is essential so that way you don't wind up arrested. For menacing or something. My main advice is go to a gunshop and they will aid you in selecting the right gun for your needs. A good gunshop will not pressure you into buying somethign you do not need. And they will aid you in filling out the paperwork and provide technical help if something breaks. I bought a rifle one time that would not shoot. No matter what brought it back 6 months later and he fixed no charge.     So my main point is go to a gunshop.|`|d938becd9c20c43cfbbbca1473443b4aaa	being a female the best choices would be a pump shotgun or a little revolver...the little revovler would be easier to hide from the little ones...I say a Ruger Sp101 in a 357mag...that way you can shoot 38 spcls for fun|`|XNpnK4vpaa	Kudos to you for asking questions.    Fear of the "unknown" is overcome with knowledge and training.  NRA Basic Training Course locator web page...  http://www.nrahq.org/education/training/...    From what you wrote, purchasing the same pistol your Dad owns seems comfortable to you.  I'm guessing it is a variation or clone of the Colt M-1911 semi-automatic pistol.    I suggest attending a firearm training course, shopping at Gun Stores with good reputations and trying a variety pistols and revolvers (some firing ranges have rental guns available) to determine which fit in your hand best and have the features you prefer.    I think it would be difficult to hold a child while dialing 911 on a cell-phone while simultaneously trying to hold a shotgun.  A pistol doesn't require both hands, a shotgun requires using both hands.  A pistol can be carried discretely, a shotgun isn't something most people carry while grocery shopping.    The sales clerks at a Gun Store can guide you through the purchase process.  You'll need your I.D. (driver's license or equivalent) and possibly a permit or card required by State Law(s) in your location.    New pistols from manufacturers such as H&K, Springfield Armory, Kimber, Ruger, Smith & Wesson, SIG Arms, Glock, Colt, Taurus, Kahr Arms and Beretta are worthy of consideration.  Used firearms are like used cars.  Some are a good value and some are not.      A firearm is something you must bet your life upon along with the lives of those you protect.  Choose wisely.    May you and your loved ones enjoy safe journeys.|`|vRmsvSb6aa	A .22 will make a hole just like anything else.|`|92jr44kFaa	Ok, lets knock some of this out here.  1.  A firearm is a valid and legitimate investment for home defense.  There is nothing wrong with wanting to do this.  2.  A firearm is only as dangerous to have in the home as the safety habits of the person who owns it.  3.  No .22's.  They make a hole, but a hole is not going to stop someone from hurting you.  Research "terminal ballistics"  4.  No blanks.  You do not fire a weapon to scare someone.  You fire it to STOP someone. A firearm is a lethal force last resort, not a noise maker to scare someone away.  5.  Do not buy from a pawn shop.  You don't know what you are getting, and you'll pay way too much.  Save the money, and buy a new, modern firearm, from a respected dealer.  This will also take care of any legal concerns you might have about the firearm.  6.  A smaller firearm is not less likely to be taken out of your hands.    Now that that is out of the way...    Investing in a firearm is a big decision, especially when you have a child in the house.  Like any other tool, it is important to learn and diligently follow all the required safety precautions.  Furthermore, you must be willing to invest time and money into training.  That means buying ammo, and going to the range on a regular basis.  A firearm is useless if you aren't proficient with it.    It's hard to argue with a shotgun for home defense.  They are fairly inexpensive, ammo is cheap and widely available in many types, and the recoil is manageable.  However, they are bulky when compared to handguns, and more difficult to store in a 'ready-to-go' condition, but still be safely out of the hands of the kids.  After all, an attacker is not going to stop and wait for you to load your firearm.  If you are not going to keep it loaded and ready, then you might as well just get some rocks to throw at him instead.    As a general rule, the best handgun you can own for personal protection is the largest bullet in the smallest frame that you can handle.  A .45 is a great choice, though they kick a little more.  I wouldn't go with anything smaller than a 9mm.    I suggest finding your local shooting ranges and visiting them.  Usually, the guys/girls on the range are MORE than happy to answer questions, show off their toys, and I'll bet that most of them would even let you try a shot or to.  Most of the people on the range are a friendly and helpful bunch.  I will E-mail you with more information.|`|8MUj24s6aa	First once you gain the proper knowledge and safety about guns they are quite safe when handled in a safe manner. Yes respect what firearms can do but there is no need to fear them. However until you get over your fear (basically by shooting with friends, at a range, etc.) do not buy one.    In line of what you need depends on your state and local area laws and such. Definitely will need that clean criminal history and basically your best bet is to go to a FFL gun shop and ask questions. Get a feel for what feels best in your hand and ask questions. No question is too stupid. ASK until you are satisfied with the answer.     If the gun is sold in a federally licensed shop all guns there are legal.    As for caliber I suggest 9mm. Low recoil, decent for defense as many police depts. are required to use 9mm in their duty weapons. All semi-automatic handguns have a chance to jam but if you buy a good brand and model it will be unlikely. A revolver has almost no chance of jamming but the calibers cost more in ammo (9mm is only about $20 for 100 rounds for target ammo) and has a little more recoil depending on the size barrel.    Some suggested models to look at:  Taurus 24/7 Pro  Springfield Armory XD  Ruger SR9    Make sure you also get a good safe as well. Something that is easy and fast for you to get into but something that will keep your children out of.   Take a safety course as well as a defensive handgun course as well. It is as important as getting the gun.    Good luck and Safe shooting.    PS. I would stay away for a shotgun at this time. A shotgun has a different role in home defense than a handgun...Go with the handgun and learn how to use it and you will be fine.|`|WBGnXsr7aa	All i can say is be careful there were alot of bad answers given to this question and only 1 or 2 decent ones|`|AM33tqYAaa	i have a .45 magnum revolver, for protection uses only.    go to your local pawn shop, go get your concealed firearm license first, at my pawn shop, the owner registers the gun for you, ask around, go to the local gun range and ask around.    and if someone does break in, you do have the right to bear arms, and check your local senate office, and see if they have the "Make My Day Law"  which means if someone is causing you any physical harm, or you have logical probability that they will cause you harm, or if they are most likely to rob you, or arson,  you can shoot them.|`|k4fd4jnjaa	Something small that someone can not wrench out of your hands.Enough to injure so you can run to safety.Get to know the gun and take lessons from a shooting range.

They have talent, and can win a Super Bowl in the next 5 years, but not until they get a Winner as a coach.  3. Yes. 10-1 odds they'll repeat. I think they will.

A lot of the offensive scheme was written around the abilities of those two, so they didn't make the playoffs. This time, everyone will be back. (Well, almost everyone)   4. It depends on Warner and Boldin. If Boldin ends up on the Eagles, or Lions, and Warner retires, they won't make the playoffs. I don't see Leinert as a future NFL QB.   5. I think he will. No. I don't think he's a good playoff coach. He freezes up, and gets too conservative. Many of his proteges have done the same. Bill Cowher was the only one who broke the mold, with the help of Randle El, and his array of talents.|`|XLXncQu9aa	1.  Brady's rehab hasn't gone exactly according to plans, so he may not be ready to start the season right off the brink.  However, I can say this from observation, when you come back from an injury like Brady has had, you are not the same QB.  We saw it with Donovan McNabb.  I don't think Brady will re-injure himself but he won't be playing at 100%.      2. I think the Chargers have the talent to make the super bowl, but they need to address the issues on offense.  They have a talented defensive line, but the problem on offense is their consistency.  They lack the big plays when they need it.  Also I think the Steelers may stand in the way of a super bowl run.  Also don't count out the Jets as they may be improved under Rex Ryan.     3. I think the odds of the Steelers going again are very high.  They have everything in place with the exception of a great offensive line.  They were injured on the o-line this season.  If they can get healthy there, continue their great defense and score more points offensively they can repeat.     4. I think the Cardinals will be a better team.  Event though they lost the super bowl when they had a chance, they are motivated.  This team before Whisenhunt took over as coach was un-inspired.  Now they have a no nonsense coach along with a hall of fame QB in Kurt Warner if he comes back.  As long as they keep the pieces they have, and improve on defense they can win games.  I think they will be 10-6 next year.     5. I don't think Marty will come back at least not this coming season.  The problem is that he is known more for taking teams to the playoffs and collapsing in the post season.  He's a great regular season coach and has over 200 wins.  But winning in the regular season isn't enough.  I don't think teams are looking for him because they already know his post season track record.  They want an all around winner someone like Bill Cowher or Mike Shannahan.|`|BFLLJc7eaa	i doubt brady is going to get injured again.  anything could happen, anyone could make the Superbowl  i doubt the steelers are going to make it again|`|M5ykrN4Laa	Looks like you forgot who one the Superbowl last year, the NFC team New York Giants and they didnt suck this year ...please think about what you are saying before you say it..sorry for being a little rude.|`|lPDHMOVZaa	1. Only his ego after he starts the Patriots off at 1-5 and then gets benched in favor of Matt Cassel.     2. Anything is possible... the Chargers are capable of beating any of those teams on any given sunday... the hard part will be beating them in consecutive games, during the playoffs.     3. No. Though they have done so on two different occasions in the past, it's just too hard for teams to repeat as Superbowl champs...     4. Depends on what Warner does. If he stays, then the Cardinals will do well and most likely will repeat as NFC West champs... though I doubt they will make the Superbowl again. If Warner retires... then the Cardinals will fall into mediocrity and will have a hard time getting back to the post-season.     5. No. If he did... it would depend on what team he came back to... I'd guess he probably wouldn't even make the playoffs, let alone end his streak.|`|pANpZ3vaaa	1.  I'm not god, so can't be certain if he will get re-injured.  Although he will never be the same old brady, and the pats also lost some personnel in the offseason, so this is a hint for your next question!    2.  Chargers have a very good chance of going deep in the playoffs.  Brady will not be the same if he does play.  The colts lost the OC, DC, and Head Coach this season, so who knows how bad they will suck. Steelers will have a good shot though.      3. Steelers O-line was on injured reserve or hurt al season long and they won with backupo players, so yeah they could be a threat next year, because their defense will always be great under dick lebeau and tomlin.    4.  Ken whisenhunt is all about consistency, however, if Warner does not return for the next season, they will not get far with Lienart. If warner does come back for another season, then the Cards have  legitimate shot at repeating.    5.  Marty Shottty will not be back in 2009. If he does come back in the future, yes his playoff streak will most likely continue, becuase he is now getting older by the day (dont get me wrong marty is a great coah)!|`|AA10188905	1) No. Pats will return to their dominance.  2) No. Colts will win Super Bowl next season.  3) No. Odds 7-1? idk it wont happen.  4) Arizona will be good enough to win their division next season even if they dont have Warner.  5) He wont.

lKU9aJWQaa	hey mate, i started running the day after boxing day, going three times a week, pushing myself each time a little bit more. at the start i couldn't run the length of my street, but now im up to 2.2 miles (3.6 k). it's easier if you do it in the evenings when it's dark and you can stick your ipod in and zone out a little bit. seriously, get on it, you'll enjoy it!!|`|M5ykrN4Laa	Ok now this is serious...push yourself do 1.5 in one HOUR motivate yourself like Nike says..."JUST DO IT!"|`|AA10188905	My best advice would be to just work on long distance running. Just practice as much as you can. The most important thing will be to find a pace that allows you to do as well as you need to.|`|uSqJ8nKBaa	in a month you can run 8 miles easy. with proper training... no Wait within 2 weeks you can surpass that. Not a month.    Just run a bit a day and you'll gain endurance.|`|jojKjhUcaa	are you kidding me? 1.5 miles i was in the Airforce retired now i'm 43 but i can still max the mile and a half, go get some running shoes, jog 1 lap around the track, to warm up then start stretching esp. your hamstrings get someone to help you friend boyfriend who ever and pick a distance that's around a1.5 miles with little traffic are jog it, push thru it do-not stop not even once, then the next day find a stadium jog 1 lap then stretch esp. your hamstrings then run a full lap and the end of that lap run to the end of the bleachers up to the top over to the middle down over to the end back up to the top over to the opposite end down around the track another lap to the opposite side and repeat total 4 times then walk a cool down lap alternate bleachers and 1.5 to two miles everyday five days a week. remember to stretch.
VsyKJ5Ocaa	Alright...so a six team league makes it different than a deeper league.  If you were going to straight up take the best players of the list, I would go with Cabrera and Braun.  You'll get that power and RBI that you wanted.  The problem with that approach is that, now, you have a 3B and two OF with your first 3 picks, and those are far and away the deepest positions in the game.  You can get good quality OF that will get you power MUCH later in the draft.  You cannot get, say, a top rate SS or 2B, later in even a shallow draft like this.    I prefer a strategy in a shallow draft like this of drafting some of the positions that only have a couple elite players (2B and SS primarily) early on, since everyone in the league will have a really good OF and really good 1B/3B.  But only a few will nab those top tier choices up the middle.    With that in mind, I would like to see you perhaps draft Hanley Ramirez with the first pick and then with the 12/13 spot go with one big basher (probably Cabrera, Braun, Hamilton in that order) and one more player at a weaker position (Ian Kinsler or Chase Utley...tossup there).  Then look to flesh out the OF and corner infield spots in round 4/5 and start on pitchers after that (with the possibility of nabbing a pitcher in the 4/5 rounds if there's a steal available).    And don't draft a catcher until you really HAVE to...    Good luck to you!|`|p3rnyBoYaa	1-5 should go in any order   Hanley-Reyes-Arod-Wright-Pujols    The next 4 should be   Santana-Braun-Cabrera-Kinsler    Two players will go before you pick. Maybe Rollins Utley or Teixiera.    This should leave you with one of the above and   -Matt Holliday  -Carlos Beltran  -Just Morneau  -Hamilton  -Howard    If Utley or Teixeira is available I would take one and I would probably pick Howard. Holliday will be playing in Oak and he should drop in numbers. Hamilton could be big risk/reward, if could improve but he could also go the other way. Beltran and Morneau would be good picks here too|`|SEcM9EDZaa	Man, I'm sick of this type of question...    There's no way to predict who the other owners in your league will take. Each draft has a life of it's own with runs on different positions at various points throughout, but the first couple of rounds generally follow the default rankings unless there's a player with injury concerns.    BTW-I think A-Fraud at 1 is a poor choice. go with Albert Pujols, then grab Longoria or Aramis Ramirez to play 3rd.|`|ozVqauMXaa	I'd take Ryan Howard and Cabrera.  Honestly though, I don't know about A-Rod at one.  I'd consider Pujols...look what he did last year with a bum elbow.  The Cards are going to be better this year, and pitchers will have to challenge him more often.

HUU4AS19aa	A NCAA football playoff would be a great idea, but 20 teams would be too many. A 20 team bracket would allow some teams to enter the tournament with putting little effort into their season, and it could also extend the season into the next semester, something that a good bit of the colleges want to avoid.<br>  <br>  I've been doing my homework on this for over a year now, and my best scenario is to take the current BCS bowl format (which uses 10 teams to make its bowl games) and tweak it into a 12 team, 4 round playoff with a limit of 2 eligible teams per conference. Incentive will be given to higher ranked teams by giving the top 4 BCS conference champions a first round bye, and the games can be scheduled throughout the 3 weeks of bowl games. The problems of extending the season too far and making the regular season less meaningful would be addressed this way, and with 6 at-large bids available, it would also give your Boise States and Hawaiis a shot at making a run for the national title. The 4 venues are already there, so why not add 1 more team to each of them?|`|m8GNr8Pqaa	i like the idea but 20 teams is a little far out there, if ncaa fottball ever has a playoff there will most likely be 4 teams, but dont count out the possibility of 8 teams, no more than that.  Whats good about a playoff is that you have an undisputed champion take the top teams and let them play it out|`|cVvHWcJ3aa	I'm watching sportscenter and they are talking about a BCS Playoff in 2014. thats quite a ways to go, but it will be worth it. but 2014 will be the year they reconsider the idea of a 4 team playoff.|`|hxEeAhcwaa	I think they should choose the 8 best teams and undefeated teams automatically make it|`|AA11307224	It won't ever go that far.  Yesterday the chairperson's of the BCS Conferences met in Holiday, Florida to discuss their need for changes since the current BCS format is set to expire at the end of this season.  The SEC commissioner proposed a +1 format that allows the top 2 teams to play after the bowl games, offering a bit of a playoff, but it was shot down 4 votes to 2.|`|30df7c325ae8f7474ce61c26a63fc215aa	Dude that Idea is totally awesome but it will never happen because NCAA Football is totally and completely gay I hated seeing Ohio State getting there *** kicked twice.  If they at least lost in a game leading to the National Championship rather then  in the National championship it would be less embarassing
LZfWEOLSaa	cheerleading is much more pleasing to watch wink wink|`|sU1l7Ddxaa	omg, im in the same postion every year.<br>  what i do is i choose volleyball for a fall sport and cheerleading(competition) in the winter.<br>  that way i can set and spike, and be a flyer. <br>  i love doing both,<br>  if your school doesnt have winter cheerleadin (for basketball/competition) then choose one one year and the other the next year. and for you final two years of highschool, choose th e one you liked best|`|H3TX34s9aa	personally, i play volleyball, so either way i think you should choose volleyball...<br>  <br>  but if you dont mind putting yourself out there with a required smile and makeup then be a cheerleader...if you dont care about how you look, do volleyball :)<br>  <br>  also, in volleyball it is more acceptable to hit people in the face haha ;)|`|VAOwlotBaa	It depends on what kind of person you are. If you like competition and fast-paced action, go for volleyball. If looking cute all the time and getting guys is more important for you, go for cheerleading.|`|4QJVo6jOaa	I was a cheerleader and loved every minute of it but it takes a lot of hard work and a lot of dedication but do whichever makes you the happiest|`|ad4ae711598f6cda6962f969b306bdabaa	I am 37 and I still play volleyball. I don't see too many cheer leaders.. at my age.  Anyhow, I vote volleyball because you can play it forever. You might as well get good at something you can play when you get older... :-)<br>  ENJOY!|`|5dec39c5aa774dfe3043e6a9a3b81e40aa	Volleyball,,|`|1kF3DSaPaa	volleyball is much more exciting. it seems way more fun than cheerleading.|`|adcRp0fYaa	volleyball its more rewarding than cheerleading|`|nCqrd9HIaa	if you are a boy choose volleyball,but if you are a girl choose cheer leading|`|WFTL2X9iaa	volleyball is way more fun an more rewarding : )|`|V1qN5VIraa	either way you get to run around with short  shorts or a short skirt lol i say vollyball|`|wRMbebdWaa	DO cheerleader like that you will get more guys....trust me...lol|`|30df7c325ae8f7474ce61c26a63fc215aa	CHEERLEADING.<br>  that is my sport,<br>  but it depends if it is competitive or not.<br>  if it is just school then i choose volleyball.

Breathing through your mouth gives your body more oxygen and in a race you need all the oxygen that you can get.<br>  <br>  It could effect your time. I'm not sure. Expirement during workouts.<br>  <br>  I don't breathe through my nose, to difficult for me.|`|0LjOVKOnaa	to tell the truth that method of breathing simply allows you to get longerdeeper breathes creating less cramps but breathing through only your mouth is soooo much easier...either way will not effect your times and to compensate the long breathes doing ab workouts really stop cramps therin eliminating the need for breathing that requires an insane amount of focus to keep constant|`|3UlGbeDBaa	After time and my speed increases as does the distance covered, I begin breathing in and out through my mouth.  The extent of my effort has passed breathing thru my nose.<br>  Work your quads more for track:  do lunges, burpees, deep knee bends.
