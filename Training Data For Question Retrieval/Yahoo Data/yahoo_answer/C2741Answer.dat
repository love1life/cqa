CfP1AvTAaa	There is a good chance it is not broken, however she may have stepped on something that injured her leg/foot. She may have something stuck in it, causing an infection which may be why she is throwing up...I also suggest to take her to the vet asap, but until you do check her leg as gently as possible and see if there are any cuts or anything stuck. Do not attempt to remove anything stuck if there is, it needs to be seen by a vet. Put gentle pressure on her leg/foot to see where exactly the pain is coming from to narrow it down. Dont stress the dog in any way until she is taken to the vet and good luck. Also make sure if she is not eating that she is at least maintaining fluids, if she is not you really need to go to the vet immediatly. Again, good luck and best wishes.|`|3rpneAjIaa	TAKE HER TO THE VET IMMEDIATELY! this sounds serious and should be taken care of...|`|dZfj0S6gaa	VET  NOW !!!!!|`|4TX26viFaa	Broken bone?  Glass splinter in the leg?  Cracked bone? Tendon ripped?  Any of these are agony, the dog needs a vet right away not in hours.|`|UOkxvhY7aa	Get off the internet and take her to the vet now, not in a little bit. |`|uYNs2utAaa	Rush her to a vet ASAP!  |`|2onH11PWaa	Try your best to keep her comfortable and keep her off the leg as much as possible. What do you mean be a little bit? Like a few hours? If so good, if not get her in as soon as you can. She may be in real trouble especially if she cant eat or drink. Let us know how she is doing.|`|702b875560d5c6e4bb5a31f860b05696aa	This might be unlikely, but my dog used to have pain in her legs as well. Apparently, she had arthritis. So try to keep her warm and snug so that the pain won't be so...well...painful. The cold seemed to make her legs give out, which is why her legs would shake from time to time. The best thing for you to do is let her lie down and sleep (do as little walking/ jumping as possible). Also, make sure she drinks plenty of water. |`|2P5WRadhaa	Sounds serious. You don't say it's age. It could be arthritis; it could be a sprain. It could be internal injuries from the dog being injured. What you've said is both good and bad. It's VERY GOOD that you recognize the need for the dog to see the vet. However, it's VERY VERY BAD that you don't recognize the seriousness of the dog's problem enough to drop what you're doing and get it to the vet ASAP.But that IS what you need to do...for the sake and well being of the dog, which should be priority in your schedule right now because you know the dog has some unknown problem. Please Do it, now! There should be no "meantime."|`|AA10198825	Let her rest............or better, bring her to the vet ASAP|`|sP9kOpviaa	I think she might have a sprained or broken leg so you should get her to the vet now.
375mTs8caa	Ok,    Your cat may be having SERVAL symtoms of things    Like a stroke    and RABIES      Rabies and having a stroke are deadly      Please take him to the vet      It may start turning on you if you dont get him looked at      And also if you get bit by your cat then you too can get rabies      They can give your  cat a shot       Or if you get bit go to the doctor      But your cat may  have gotten bit like weekks before      So be careful when you handle your cat      And YES take your cat to the vet ASAP      I hope you found this useful and mark it as BEST answer      P.S. (I hope your cats okay and can live a happy life)|`|3oJL2Go3aa	I would take it to the vet right away. That is a sign of rabies.. If it ate something or got a hold of something that had rabies then that is how your cat got it.. |`|un0C52G8aa	I don't know if what your cat is experiencing is actually rabies since that disease also has other symptoms such as strange and unusual behavior or an aversion to drinking water, for example. It could be that he licked or swallowed something that is causing him to drool and foam at the mouth. You might check around your yard to see if he chewed on a plant that could be irritating or toxic to cats. That is the most likely reason for his drooling.|`|TbENA08baa	Take your pet to get emergency treatment right away.     btw: the answerer BMW is VERY freaking annoying. grrr. |`|UcJLZF9paa	OMG...  throw it away! |`|oSyCJs4iaa	it probley got diseases  |`|tv7Im1eKaa	my cat does that,,y best bet taking her or him to the vets t rule out something serious,my cats got hair balls she grooms her self and is allways swalloing her hair.,i was given some  cream to put on her paws its acts as a laxative so what she has swallowed comes out of the other end.if y cant get t  a vet try her with some oily fish like tuna in oil not brine.it worked for my cat.kepp an eye on what she throws up ,sick.   my cat had foam .when i looked closer there was hairs in it .good luck xxxxx |`|ORbz6PF8aa	If it was my cat we'd be off to the vet.    I suspect he's either eaten something that has disagreed with him, or he has a problem with his teeth. Either way down to the vets, get it checked, make sure everything is ok, put your mind at rest ;)

Try getting your cat some toys that make him play by himself like fake mice or a cat nip ball. Got to this website and check it out. It doesn;t have every answer but it does help.  It helped after I got my new kitten a month ago.|`|X25LOHVRaa	he might be lonely? usually they do this when they want attention from you. he must be a very social cat. our cat is the same and he'll be your best mate forever. i think sometimes they just want some pampering.|`|lExeEljVaa	Cats mainly do this for love. You are like her mother. She loves you.|`|K7H1zrCbaa	mine does,  but shes a kitten.  she just wants love|`|3oJL2Go3aa	Mine does that and they just want attention.

I hope this helps and you find it as your BEST answer|`|TbENA08baa	I have a couple kittens that do that.

9d8438febeda9f081685c3c773c13d90aa	o.k...So if she were preggo, she'd be 33 days preggo, correct ?  Her tummy would be swollen, yes...If the "offending" male were about her size...You'd seriously know by now...You could actually thump on her tummy a few times to "wake pups up" and feel the movement..    Try this little test...When she's relaxed, thump on her tummy, seriously...This will wake up any pups and then place your hand on her tummy and check for movement...No movement ? Get her wormed...lol    You feel movement there ? Guess what, you're gonna be a grandma..|`|3oJL2Go3aa	First thing. If you are not wanting her to be pregnant then you should of thought about that before she got pregnant. Yes I believe she is pregnant. Also the only reason why people dont get their dog fixed is because they want them to breed. Also you are not sure that her belly is going to be small. My mom had a poodle terrier mix who breaded with another terrier and she had 6 pups. Her belly was huge. So you dont know how many pups are in there. Especially with all the breeds combined. But her nipples will start to get big about 3 or 2 weeks before she has the pups. Once they start being exposed then its almost time. You want to make sure she has a place that is away from people and other animals and also quiet. Because she will be stressed out and that can be risky when she is in labor and after delivery. You also want to have a emergency kit so just incase something happens you have the items to help her... You also need to get her to the vet and get the vets number so that if anything goes wrong he or she can coach you over the phone. Once she does have them dont worry about the blood and mess. She will clean herself up.. Good Luck!|`|P2yRAWiJaa	She should have been fixed BEFORE getting pregnant.    Why do people like you think about the important, responsible things after something stupid has happened?  Just because she's small doesn't mean her stomach will stay small during the pregnancy. IF she's pregnant in the first place.    When you think she's about 55 days along get an x-ray done. It'll tell you if there are pups and how many. Once that's been established you need to get her a safe place to have pups...keep her inside in a warm environment...give her more food....more frequent potty breaks...and get an emergency medical kit (in case you need to help)  with scissors, betadine, thread, nose suction bulb, clean towels, alcohol (to sterilize), gloves, and puppy formula in case she won't feed them. Also get an emergency vet   in case it's the middle of the night when she has them and there's trouble.    Good luck!|`|L22hVXTIaa	Unfortunately, we have to give you a little crap and tell you your dog probably IS pregnant.  Some female dogs barely show if they're pregnant and she could be carrying only one or two puppies.  You won't know for sure until she goes past the 8-9 week time frame with no puppies.  If you were lucky enough to dodge the bullet this time, get her fixed ASAP.|`|bgs7Bvkoaa	Some little dogs hardly show in their first pregnancy but their boobs will swell in the last 2 weeks but before that they can show no signs. If it is 1 pup you will hardly tell. Make sure she has somewhere to nest 7 birth her pups & that place should be somewhere she can go to now & feel safe. Also some small breeds have problems birthing so really keep an eye on her when she dose go into labour as I'm sure she will.|`|oSyCJs4iaa	she is probley pregnant|`|7bI5KmSTaa	If she is pregnant she should start to noticeably gain weight. by now her appetite should be a little bigger and her nipples should start getting a little bit longer.  Just a little bit.|`|iWQPDd9Saa	i think that if your dog is getting a little belly because it is winter time so that they would be eating more.
34uWa9kHaa	If you know your dog jumps the fence then why  didn't you do something about it.      As a Pit Bull owner this stupid crap pi$$es me off.       You need to make sure all your documentation is in order.  Get your damn fence fixed. Start now, not when the dog warden comes and tells you too.  Show that you are making efforts to contain the dog.  It is not the dogs fault it's yours and it is at risk of lossing it's life.    I don't know what state you are in.  So you will want to check into the laws.  There is a process before a dog is deemed dangerous and put down.   Your dog could just be deemed dangerous and you will have to have so much insuracne, certain fencing requirements.  Muzzling the  dog in public etc.     The ER will have to report the dog bite.   I hope you have homeowners/renters insurance.     Offer to pay the medical put it in writing that you made the offer.    It it is a small wound that does help.   If the dog was seriously gonna bite her she would not have such a small wound.   My son was bit on his nose by a dachshund small wound that did need two stitches.  I hope that is all this is.      Good luck and please whatever the outcome.  Do not set this dog up to fail again, (if she does not loss her life over this)  or any dog for that matter.      edited.  Then you need to add a top to the kennel.  make sure it is secure underneath every where.     Is the yard fenced in also or does the dog just have a kennel.  If it's just a kennel.  You need to fence in the yard as well.   If this goes to court that is gonna be a requirement anyways.|`|lmSffrNuaa	Hi, it says, If your dog bites    You are legally responsible to keep your dog from hurting people or damaging property. If you don't, you may have to pay a fine or even do jail time--not to mention shelling out for someone's medical bills, lost wages, pain and suffering, or lost livestock.    The laws vary from state to state, but you could be liable if:        * Your dog hurts a person or damages property, even if he's been a perfect angel up until that moment. More than half the states in the U.S. have such laws.      * If you knew your dog might hurt a person, and he does. These are known as 'one-bite rules.' (This doesn't mean your dog can get away with one bite; if your dog has shown any aggression to people--snapping, growling, lunging--that counts.)      * If you were negligent. For instance, if you left your gate open and your dog got out and bit someone.    The details of these laws vary from state to state. For instance, in some states the injury must be severe, or the dog must have been running free when the incident happened.     Check this link for more information. Hope this helps.    http://dogtime.com/dog-laws.html|`|71i6IjdZaa	If they sue you, and your found guilty, sorry but i'd say your dog would have to be put down. =( Your dog was probably playing, my dog bites me all the time and leaves a tiny mark/scratch but she is only playing! Or maybe the girl was teasing your dog, its possible maybe she hurt your dog and it bit her. You could also argue to the court that this girl wasn't being supervised, and you did the best you could to keep your dog restrained. If it was to be put down, and if you love your dog that much, then I would suggest hiding it at someones house and when the people come to collect your dog, you tell them that you already got it destroyed. Good luck with everything!:)|`|ac92f82f4d5b3f3af2d01d0117d482cbaa	Your first 5 words after your question tells me you need to have some damned good homeowner insurance.|`|7a8qCNU2aa	It's not a "mere" dog bite. Quit trying to validate the fact that your dog left your property and injured another person. You're lucky she only got a scratch, can you imagine the trouble you'd be in if she'd been mauled? It's not a child's fault if they "alert" a dog by panicking...     The bottom line is if you cannot keep your dog properly caged, you are liable for any and all expenses that are caused by your pet, whether it be injury or property damage. They may also have your dog put down, if they decide to sue and fight hard enough for it.|`|tB7QK6BTaa	Hope your insurance is paid up.  You are 100% responsible for containing your dog and for ensuring it is not a threat to the public.  Your dog bit a child, the magnitude of the bite is entirely irrelevant.  The parents can, and likely will insist on the dog being destroyed as a danger to the public, and they can, and likely will sue your *** off.  They have the absolute right to seek immediate medical care whether you 'think' it's worthy of an emerg. visit or not.     Also you admit that you knew your containment fence was inadequate and that your dog was inclined to leave the yard, if they find any witnesses to that fact you are double screwed because your only defense would have been 'first offense, did not know', but you did know that your dog was jumping the fence, and if others know that you knew that........|`|4higWvgaaa	Pit Bull bites little girl, probably going to be put to sleep, and you'll most likely have to pay a fine, at the least, perhaps be taken to court.  Maybe to you the bite looks minor.  Don't be surprised if animal control hauls off your dog.  Probably going to cost  you a pretty penny!  So, your dog jumps the fence, this wasn't a one time thing.  Why didn't you fix the fence, or kennel your dog.  Vicious dogs like Pit Bulls should NOT be allowed to roam freely.  You ARE IN TROUBLE!  Better seek some legal help.|`|AA10198825	You might have to pay for the medical expenses, like $250, or......put your dog to sleep.|`|PvZwFe5daa	Whether or not your dog has it's rabies shot isn't what this is going to depend on.  The bottom line is that you are responsible for containing your dog, and if it did escape and bite this girl, you have no way to prove it didn't happen because you were not in control of the dog and you are completely liable.      If they choose to take her to the ER (which is COMPLETELY reasonable for any dog bite due to risk of infections) you would be wise to offer to pay for it.  A little kindness now could go a long way.      If you are lucky enough to not be sued or have your dog taken and destroyed over this, you need to figure out a way to keep it contained.  If you can't make a higher and deeper fence, your dog can't be out there unsupervised.  You are just asking for trouble - any dog that is running around unsupervised is a huge liability.|`|KIUeRwSdaa	I hate to say this, but you do have a bad rep having a pit (although they are lovely and caring dogs!)  Also, Emergency care goes through the roof.  My mom had an emergency kidney stone removed and it cost in the 20,000 range.  If it was done scheduled it would be around a couple 1,000.  I could say if you could ask the parents to ask the issurance to cover most of it and then you pay what they dont cover (that will help)  also, is there anyway that you can prove it wasn't your dog ex: were was he at the time, have the pit temperment tested, was the little girl taunting, was the little girl supervised?

If you go to court, get yourself a lawyer, or try to settle. Chances are you'd lose, because the dog was not properly restrained in your yard. No matter how "good" he usually us, they will take him for 10 days (or more/less where you are at) and run him through behavioral tests. If you get him back, you are going to have to do something about the fence jumping. And, chances are because of the breed he us -unfortunately pit bulls rarely get seen in a good light- and the fact that you have not cared up until this point to keep him in your yard (or your house for that matter) that a judge will rule in favor of the child and her family. YOU may be able to fight it and say the kid provoked him, but get yourself a damn good lawyer. And if the biting was on her property, your chances are slim. No matter how "minor", a dog bite must be reported if the dog breaks the skin like this on a stranger, and it may be worse than it looks and the probability of it getting infected is high.

de4d478160a61265939f30ba46a9b580aa	Com certeza. Se voc tiver acesso a uma hpica, com algumas aulas e um pouco de determina??o, voc aprender a montar. O tempo para aprender depende da pessoa. Se voc tiver medo de montar,  mais complicado. Depois de aprender a montar, voc pode escolher um estilo de equita??o (salto, adestramento, baliza, tambor, ...) para treinar. Mas uma coisa muito importante a se saber antes de aprender a andar a cavalo  que eles s?o animais muito sensveis, e se voc n?o tiver amor pelo animal, desista. O mais legal de se saber montar e justamente o contato com os cavalos, que s?o animais magnficos.   Agora, se voc quiser aprender apenas o bsico, a v?o algumas dicas:   Para dire?ionar o cavalo,  s puxar as rdeas para o lado que voc que ir. Para fazer ele andar, bata com os calcanhares (de leve) na barriga, e para parar, puxer as rdeas (dependendo do cavlo, puxe com mais ou menos for?a, at que ele pare). Cuidado ao montar, porque cavalos s?o muito sensveis e podem se assustar fcil com um barulho ou alguma coisa estranha e chamativa que ele nunca viu (se algum abrir um guarda chuva perto de um cavalo de repente, a n?o ser que ele j esteja acostumado a isso, com certeza vai ter algum rea??o).    Tambm  importante estar com os joelhos sempre em contato com a sela,pois se o cavalo empinar os correr de repente, voc estar firme e n?o ir cair. Coloque sempre a ponta dos ps nos estribos, pois se voc estiver com os ps enfiados completamente nos estribos e por acaso cair, seus ps podem ficar presos, os que  perigoso.|`|846bb2404f63cce54c792c6682b7ea65aa	Claro que sim, em qualquer hpica|`|cf65b829d7029196de4d80346ea35354aa	Claro!

Cada um tem o seu estilo, precisa saber que tipo de montaria vc quer aprender!  Se vc pretende fzr hipismo, ou apenas aprender como se deve andar a cavalo...  Se tu tem acesso a um cavalo, que seja manso, pode aprender sozinho, basta tu montar, sempre apoiando o p esquerdo no estrivo, sentar mais para tras no basto, segurar as redeas com a mao esquerda(sempre mantenha as redeas bem firmes), se tu quer ir pra esquerda, puxa as redeas com jeito para o lado esquerdo, para a direita, puxa para o lado direito, para o cavalo ir mais depressa, solta um pouquinho elas e bate com os pes na barriga do cavalo, e papra parar, puxa as rdeas em sua dire??o, sempre com jeito, que  para o animal nao se assustar, no que tu firmar as redeas para trs, ele ir parar.  Estas sao apenas algumas dicas, pois neste assunto tenho muita experincia, mas lembre-se, todo animal tem o seu instinto, entao so tente mesmo, se tiver certeza d que  manso, pois ao contrario tu pode te machucar!  espero ter ajudado!

Assim como se cria galinhas para o abate. Como crescemos vendo e comendo carne de galinha achamos normal e aceitvel, assim como eles com rela??o aos cachorros.  Mas para a nossa cultura a carne de cachorro  inaceitvel principalmente por que criamos um la?o de afetividade com estes animais.

Uma corrente eltrica acontece quando um condutor liga dois pontos com potenciais diferentes.  Trocando em midos: O corpo do passarinho poderia se comportar como um condutor, mas quando ele pousa sobre fios de alta tens?o, ele est juntando, com suas patinhas, pontos que tenha A MESMA tens?o (mesmo que seja de milhares de volts). Por isso, n?o h corrente eltrica.   Se o passarinho, entretanto, tocasse em outro ponto com outro potencial (o ch?o, por exemplo), a ele seria torrado... tadinho!|`|67a447601ca7a1458fd9802037b40fbcaa	Porque pisam somente num fio.

Ou seja cada fio 1 fase.|`|846bb2404f63cce54c792c6682b7ea65aa	Igual`as pessoas, os pssaros ao pousar no fio de alta tens?o, n?o fazem aterramento, ficando, portanto, isolados.

Da mesma forma se uma pessoa ficar pendura se uma pessoa ficar pendurada em somente um fio de alta tens?o, sem fazer terra, n?o ocorrer nada, mas estando encostda no posto, ira ocorrer o choque. Por isso se olhar muitos fios s?o afastados para que o passaro ao vir a pousar e neste instante est de asas abertas, e se uma asa encostar no outro fio, automaticamente ocorrer o curto-circuito,|`|1cde3352d2436fef0e16437b2725b8b2aa	Porque n?o est?o em contacto com a terra  Para a corrente electrica passar tem que haver condutor da faze e do neutro  No caso dos passaros eles est?o ou na FAZE ou no NEUTRO logo a correbnte n?o passa por eles|`|a7756f8647e42d1e833795a616678a30aa	Muitas dessas respostas est?o certas.

O passarinho n?o desvia o caminho da corrente, mas se ele tocar no poste, por exemplo, bau, bau, vira torresminho. Por isso  que para salvar algum que estar recebendo carga eltrica vc tem que saltar e tentar acert-lo com um pis?o, pois se ficar com os ps no ch?o vai levar choque tambm.|`|ef95833f42bbefe2450f7ddda35018bcaa	Vamos tentar uma explica??o simples.  Para que exista uma corrente eltrica e por conseqncia um choque eltrico  necessrio que exista o contato em dois plos, o positivo e o negativo.  A tomada eltrica tem dois furinhos , n?o .  Se voc tocar somente  em um furinho da tomada pode levar um choque porque o solo funciona como um plo. Como cada fio "corresponde" a um plo , se voc tocar somente em um deles e em mais nada, nem solo, nem arvores , nem fios , etc , voc n?o vai tomar um choque. Claro que estamos desconsiderando o caso dos fios encapados. Certo ?  Jesus te ama.  Valeu?|`|d26f2034c45742a52b1e6fe78dbcbd04aa	pq eles tem sorte!

dafae8f63199e6d9a54e56b6bc873204aa	Muita gente confunde siri com caranguejo. Mas eles s?o bem diferentes. A principal diferen?a entre esses dois crustceos  que o ltimo par de pernas do siri termina em uma espcie de nadadeira, enquanto que o do caranguejo termina em forma de unha. Alm disso, o siri tem, dos lados da carapa?a, espinhos longos e bem afiados. E o caranguejo  mais arredondado nas laterais do corpo. O siri e o caranguejo s?o carnvoros. Eles usam as garras para pegar um peixe e lev-lo  boca, onde  triturado e engolido. S?o capazes at de quebrar a concha de um mexilh?o para com-lo. Vivem andando pelas rochas da praia, escondendo-se em frestas. Podem tambm viver no mangue, lugar onde o rio desemboca no mar enterrados em buracos na lama ou trepado nas rvores tpicas dos manguezais. Alguns vivem entre pedras e plantas, no fundo dos rios.|`|e6dd1e09b20afaab3e53ffcb48399319aa	O siri, apesar de sua alimenta??o estranha(come carnes mortas), para o meu paladar  muito mais gostoso que o caranguejo....|`|d25c7d47c230547aaaabe0bbc4781681aa	Quando est?o dentro da panela?

O siri tem apenas seis patas enquanto o caranguejo tem 10; o siri  encontrado nas regi?es onde h o encontro da gua doce com a gua salgada do mar, onde a salinidade  bem baixa.  Em Alagoas, ele  encontrado em esturios de lagoas e rios, que se encontram com o mar.   J o caranguejo  encontrado nos mangues onde a salinidade  pequena.   Eles recebem fluxo e refluxo das mars.   Podemos dizer que eles vivem em ambientes costeiros.    Outra espcie de siri  encontrada na areia da praia.   Predador, o siri se alimenta de sobras de peixes. Como na areia ele n?o encontra a alimenta??o adequada, n?o engorda e, por isso, n?o serve para o consumo.   Quando sente a presen?a do homem, o siri se esconde rapidamente em pequenas tocas.   Por ser t?o arisco, o nordestino costuma usar a express?o "bravo que nem siri" para falar de algum arredio.   Outra curiosidade  que esse bichinho anda de lado.     O siri de coral, que  pescado nos rios e nas lagoas do estado, representa boa parte da produ??o desse crustceo no nordeste.   De acordo com o Centro de Pesquisas Pesqueiras (Cepene/Alagoas) produziu mais de 115 toneladas de siri no ano passado.   Do municpio de Jequi, saram sete toneladas.     As fmeas do siri produzem praticamente o ano todo, mas tem gente preocupada com o futuro da espcie.   Alguns pescadores se tornaram protetores dos siris|`|df00c5d20fbbae1bfcb70426142925d7aa	um  maior q o outro...........|`|cb7e0ea0bc58b6957cf4b93ff96a8394aa	O Siri  bem maior e mais gostoso!|`|4860a116e248366c0f1c92da6b706e12aa	Um anda de lado.

Ent?o para o c?o  pura divers?o zangar seu lder (o dono), e se voc corresponde, melhor ainda, sinal de que voc est gostando (no "pensamento" deles).      Ent?o, quando voc ver seu c?o fazendo o que n?o deve (principalmente mexendo em algo, pegando objetos, latidos), simplesmente n?o ligue, ignore, saia de perto.  Ele ir ficar esperando voc brigar, j que voc n?o vai fazer isso ele ir se cansar. Nem que leve muito tempo, mas quando ele vir que voc n?o "responde", ele pra. Quando ele vir que voc n?o se zanga mais, para ele perdeu a gra?a j que a brincadeira est em zangar voc.    Fa?a isso por duas ou trs vezes ou at quando for necessrio.     Isso vale pra todo comportamento indesejvel de seu c?o. Se ele fizer algo que n?o queira, simplesmente ignore.    Perceba que sempre que voc fica com raiva, eles teimam mais.     UMA DICA:    Deixe os objetos os quais ele n?o pode mexer fora de seu alcance. E deixe alguns que ele pode destruir (n?o brinquedos dele). Ele tem que perceber que esses objetos n?o s?o pra mexer, finja que esqueceu em algum lugar. Fa?a com que ele veja que voc viu que ele pegou e ignore. Co m o tempo ele ver o que voc quer.    E nunca bata, n?o se resolve nada, e o c?o ficar com medo de voc.

Na maioria dos casos o sistema imunitrio reage eficazmente pela produ??o de uma resposta citotxica (resposta Th1) que destroi os macrfagos portadores de leishmanias. Nestes casos a infec??o  controlada e os sintomas leves ou inexistentes, curando-se o doente ou desenvolvendo apenas manifesta??es cutaneas. No entanto se o sistema imunitrio escolher antes uma resposta (humoral ou Th2) com produ??o de anticorpos, n?o ser eficaz a destruir as leishmanias que se escondem no interior dos macrfagos, fora do alcance dos anticorpos. Nestes casos a infec??o progride para a leishmaniose visceral, uma doen?a grave, ou no caso das espcies menos virulentas para manifesta??es mucocutaneas mais agressivas e crnicas. Naturalmente que um individuo imunodeprimido n?o reage com nenhuma resposta imunitria vigorosa, e estes, especialmente os doentes com SIDA/AIDS, desenvolvem progress?es muito mais perigosas e rpidas com qualquer dos patognios. Em Portugal, Espanha, Itlia e Fran?a este grupo tm ultimamente formado uma percentagem grande dos doentes com formas de leishmaniose graves.    A leishmaniose visceral, tambm conhecida por kala-azar ou febre dumdum, tem um periodo de incuba??o de vrios meses a vrios anos. As leishmanias danificam os org?os ricos em macrofagos, como o ba?o, o fgado, e a medula ssea. Caracteriza-se na minoria de individuos que desenvolvem sintomas por inicio insidioso de febre, tremores violentos, diarreia, suores, mal estar, fatiga, hepatoesplenomeglia, anemia, leucopenia e por vezes manifesta??es cutaneas como lceras e zonas de pele escura (denominado kala azar, doen?a preta em hindi e persa), em adultos principalmente. Se n?o tratada  mortal num periodo curto ou aps danos crnicos durante alguns anos, especialmente em doentes com SIDA/AIDS.    A leishmaniose cutanea tem uma incuba??o de algumas semanas a alguns meses aps o que surgem sintomas como surgimento de ppulas ulcerantes extremamente irritantes nas zonas picadas pelo mosquito, que progridem para crostas com liquido seroso. H tambm escurecimento por hiperpigmenta??o da pele, com resolu??o das les?es em alguns meses com forma??o de cicatrizes inestticas. A leishmaniose mucocutanea  semelhante mas com maiores e mais profundas les?es, que se estendem s mucosas da boca, nariz ou genitais.|`|846bb2404f63cce54c792c6682b7ea65aa	do Centro de Cincias Biolgicas, prop?e novas formas de diagnstico e controle da doen?a, que atinge homens e c?es. O estudo sugere que o diagnstico laboratorial seja feito atravs de um teste sorolgico (teste de aglutina??o direta - DAT) e um teste de gentica molecular (rea??o em cadeia da polimerase - PCR), com extra??o do DNA do parasita.   Como na leishmaniose visceral os sinais e sintomas podem ser confundidos com os de outras patologias, fazem-se necessrias a rapidez e a precis?o do diagnstico laboratorial. O teste DAT, que utiliza como antgeno o prprio parasita, apresenta a vantagem de poder ser feito no campo, pela utiliza??o da forma liofilizada que pode ser estocada  temperatura ambiente. Alm disso, o resultado deste teste  fornecido em, aproximadamente, 18 horas. J o mtodo PCR, alm de poder identificar o parasita no indivduo que ainda n?o apresenta sintomas, quando feito de rotina pode fornecer o resultado em cerca de cinco horas. Como vantagem adicional, ambos os testes utilizam a coleta de sangue perifrico (como para um hemograma comum) e n?o a pun??o de medula ssea, mtodo que, alm de doloroso e invasivo, necessita de um especialista para realiz-lo.  TRATAMENTO - O tratamento da leishmaniose visceral humana  hospitalar e deve ser ininterrupto por 20 dias. "Se o paciente pra de tomar a medica??o pode ocasionar a resistncia do parasita aos remdios", alerta Aline Alexandrino. Ela ressalta que quando a leishmaniose  canina, ocorre um problema adicional.   Uma vez que n?o h tratamento, o animal com diagnstico positivo deve ser sacrificado. Como se trata de uma endemia, a pesquisadora salienta que h necessidade de uma tomada de decis?o poltica no que tange  assistncia pblica de sade, sob pena de "todo o conhecimento acumulado n?o resultar na diminui??o do nmero de casos".  Mundo registra 500 mil novos casos da doen?a ao ano  A leishmaniose visceral, popularmente conhecida como calazar (febre negra),  uma zooantroponose, ou seja, uma enfermidade que acomete o homem e diferentes espcies de mamferos silvestres e domsticos. A incidncia anual de calazar no mundo  de 500 mil novos casos.  uma das co-infec??es mais comuns quando se trata de um portador do vrus da Aids. No Brasil, a maior incidncia de leishmaniose  no Nordeste, sendo inclusive superior  mdia geral do pas.

On ne se prive de rien, on mange la chair des autres sans trop se poser de questions et "viva" son "propre" plaisir gustatif. J'aimerai que les gens s'informe un peu plus sur la condition des animaux dans les lvages et dans les abattoirs. On a pas ide une seule seconde que les animaux paye le prix de souffrance pour le plaisir des humains. Encore une fois, l'humain exploite beaucoup trop les animaux, pour beaucoup de choses, y compris pour le plaisir et pour l'argent.  Nous avons de quoi faire des repas "vgtarien" aussi copieux que tous ces cadavres parpills sur la table,  Noel et tous les jours de l'anne.   Je suis totalement contre le fait de faire souffrir les autres, que ce soit humains ou non-humains. Mon plaisir ne compte pas plus, que de vouloir faire le bonheur de tous les non-entendus sur cette terre.  Ce no?l, des tas de gens vont encore se "gaver" de foie-gras. Nous sommes encore loin d'interdire le foie-gras, mais nous ne cesserons pas pour autant d'informer les gens sur e qu'il se passe dans les industries de tortures et de boucherie.    Le gavage des oies, ce fait avec un tube que l'on enfonce dans leur gorge pour leur faire ingurgiter du ma?s.  C'est comme-ci on nous enfoncait un tube dans la n?tre, pour nous faire avaler d'un seul coup, 73 KILOS de pates !    Pour le foie-gras "bio" c'est encore du n'importe quoi, pour que les gens puissent se donner  bonne conscience d'avaler du foie gras. C'est coeurant. Le fait de savoir, et de continuer  se faire plaisir.  On peut continuer  se faire plaisir, sans manger les autres. Le pire dans tout ?a, c'est que tous les animaux que l'ont mangent (ou presque) sont des herbivores. J'entends encore des personnes me dire, que les animaux mangent bien les humains, alors pourquoi se priver.  L'animal chasse, n'est pas libre de faire un choix, comme nous tous.    La viande c'est bourr de microbes, et de mdicaments. N'oublions pas la souffrance, en prime, loin d'tre pargns.    Que manger  No?l  la place du foie gras ?  Y'a des tonnes de recettes sans foie gras : pat vgtale, caviar d'aubergines, et autres.     J'aimerai vraiment que certains ne pense pas qu' leur plaisir, mais aussi  ceux des autres. Les ftent arrivent, c'est pire que tout. Ca devrait tre du bonheur pour tous le monde, y'en a assez de l'indiffrence vis  vis des animaux. C'est du gaspillage, car des familles sont dans la famine  cause de la production de viande.

E assim como tm aumentado os casos de c?es e gatos com problemas antes considerados restritos aos homens, s?o maiores a cada dia as possibilidades de tratamento e cura da doen?a em animais. ''Os proprietrios n?o devem desanimar nunca. ?o devem desanimar nunca. Quase sempre h o que fazer''., afirma o mdico veterinrio Kleber Moreno, doutorando em cincia animal com enfoque em oncologia e um dos scios da primeira clnica especializada em oncologia veterinria de Londrina.   Ele lembra que o sucesso do tratamento est diretamente ligado  precocidade no diagnstico do problema. ''Existe um mito de que  preciso esperar o ndulo crescer - no caso dos tumores externos - para identificar do que se trata. Isto n?o  verdade. Quanto mais cedo o incio do tratamento, maiores as chances de cura'', alerta o veterinrio. Segundo Moreno, os tratamentos de cancer em animais de companhia s?o similares aos realizados em humanos, feitos basicamente com cirurgia ou quimioterapia. Em alguns casos, s?o necessrios os dois procedimentos.   O veterinrio explica que um dos motivos de ser mais comum este tipo de ocorrncia em c?es e gatos hoje em dia  o fato deles viverem mais, por causa do aprimoramento de cuidados como vacina??o e alimenta??o. E quanto mais idoso o animal, mais suscetveis ficam os rg?os. Outra causa do aumento nos registros de ocorrncias  a maior proximidade dos homens, o que facilita a percep??o de problemas - como os ndulos externos - por parte dos proprietrios.   O mdico lembra ainda que, assim como nos humanos, fatores como a polui??o ambiental e a ingest?o de alimentos com conservantes podem levar  predisposi??o do cancer. ''Pesquisadores da USP (Universidade de S?o Paulo) est?o fazendo um estudo para verificar a correla??o do aparecimento do cancer com fatores ambientais e identificar o tipo de polui??o que est levando a isso.''   De acordo com Moreno, os tumores de mama em cadelas e gatas e os tumores cutaneos, de maneira geral, s?o os casos mais comuns. Entre os gatos, a ra?a siamesa  a que tem a maior predisposi??o para neoplasias (que  a forma??o de novos tecidos, benignos ou n?o). J entre os c?es os mais predispostos s?o os das ra?as boxer, rotwailer, labrador, dog alem?o e, de forma geral, os de mdio e grande porte.   Moreno explica que o objetivo da clnica  trabalhar em conjunto com outros profissionais, prestando um servi?o especializado. ''Muitos veterinrios ainda vem no cancer um sin?nimo de morte, mas na maioria das vezes a cura  possvel ou, na pior das hipteses,  possvel pelo menos manter a qualidade de vida do animal'', argumenta.   clinovet@yahoo.com.b|`|38a53344ace670636229fdd087770b7caa	N?o deixe os seus gatos espostos ao sol,por causa  do suspecitives dos raios  u.v.|`|7eaaf67b50e831f5a6dcb47a8c63bd95aa	Olha, pra evitar um tumor de pele, o veterinrio indicou que agente passasse protetor solar fator50 na orelha da nossa gata.

Tease your dog with food or a toy and when the dog barks, reward instantly and say "Good". If you are having trouble say it when you catch your dog at barking or when there are other dogs around and he is barking. Soon your dog will bark at your command, then teach the command "Enough". When the dog barks after your "Speak" command say "Enough", the dog will look at you and you praise and reward. Now the dog has mastered this when he barks for no reason say "Enough" and reward a quiet dog.

Penso at que seja de propsito, pois tal ignorancia  absurdamente grande para se acreditar que seja simplesmente falta de conhecimento.   Gostaria de perguntar a esses lojistas, na tica deles, qual a vantagem de inserir essa gua ano aqurio? Qual o grande beneficio que leva ao sistema?    Vamos tentar entender: gua mineral  possui Fosfato acima da mdia permitida, Nitrato acima da mdia permitida,  extremamente Alcalina,  kH alto, difcil de tamponar, nveis de Co2 muito baixos, custa muito caro. E o problema  que quando se tem a inten??o de usar gua Mineral, na maioria das vezes,  n?o se usa condicionadores, pois a orienta??o dada  que n?o possui cloro, como se isso bastasse,  deixando muitos dos componentes qumicos  prejudiciais dentro do  sistema. O pH fica na mdia de 7.4 a 8.0 e muitos aquaristas n?o sabem que esses valores s?o demasiadamente altos para a maioria dos peixes ornamentais.    Nada de usar gua de chuveiro, gua de po?os, gua mineral, de chuva, de certos filtros, at de certos rios n?o deve ser usada, pois n?o se sabe o grau de polui??o do mesmo. Por mais que n?o confiemos    na gua da rede de abastecimento,  essa ainda a melhor a ser usada.   Se fizermos uma conta bsica veremos que o uso de condicionadores tem um custo beneficio muito bom. A seguran?a em usar  AquaSafe, Dechore Ease, e outros  muito grande. Esses produtos at conseguem proteger o peixe contra determinadas doen?as, geralmente conseguem tratar uma quantidade grande de gua, de 500 a 1000 litros e custam o equivalente a 2 garraf?es de gua.. Mesmo assim, o que mais se ouve na loja em Curitiba  que o aquarista novato foi orientado a usar gua Mineral, e o pior, muitas vezes para peixes amazonenses.|`|d5d5565f33cb0cdba67ab5326d65a7faaa	Sim,  bom sim, mas se vc quiser pode utilizar um produto chamado "aqua,safe" da Tetra que condiciona a agua para o peixe|`|4205262ddf29510a7d74a6b8e22ef0c9aa	Pode usar sim, porem se vc tiver um aquario maior vai ficar caro pela quantidade usada.Use um anticloro ou o aquasafe (tetra) sai mais barato se colocar na ponta do lapis.Avantagem do aquasafe  que  anticloro e condicionador antistress para os peixes, alem de tratar as escamas e lubrifica-las.Lembre-se de controlar o Ph,agua mineral tem tendencia de ser alcalina cuidado com o choque de ph que pode matar.|`|843ae22c913765822c8333a56277b4d2aa	Cara colega, acredito que sim.

AA10314243	It is important for young cats to learn to point and click early on. This is the foundation for all later cat computational skills, especially in Windows environments. If you're not allowing her to teach him in the house, the garage was probably her next best bet. Maybe tonight wasn't absolutely necessary, but she likely experiences kitty-anxiety about her brother getting a proper education.     I say give her support, and help her to learn to calm herself and make a plan when her anxieties act up, rather than engaging in the teaching behavior right in the moment. A regular training schedule will be more helpful to her brother than late night lessons.    Also it might be helpful to remind her that lots of brief practice sessions are much more helpful for picking up proper mousing skills than long late night sessions. You might offer a lazer mouse if there are any tangling problems. Young males seem especially prone to being distracted because they want to play with the cord.|`|0f147a5dab9c2935e1fb1c3c9b33a31daa	that depends, do you want the boy to learn to catch mice? are they inside or outside cats? if outside cats there will be plenty of time for him to learn about mice later if they are bothering you. for inside/outside cats the same applies. if they/he is exclusively an inside cat keep in mind that mice carry parasites in there guts and on there body's (fleas, worms, lice, mites, etc...) so think about it. personally i find the hunting behavior of domesticate cats to be quite interesting.|`|Vxbywa0maa	Guess she is just in the mood.

He would let them go and go out and look for more. He never killed one. I think he want to have some friends to play with.
AA11616741	Maine coons do have calico patterns. They pretty much come in every color except for the pointed colors like hymalayans (spelling) have. Even breeders breed for the calico pattern. Your kitty definately sounds like a Maine coon. The large paws with the hair inbetween and the polydactyl also gives it away. I'm sure she's not purebred mainecoon, but she is a maine coon mix. Good luck with your new kitty.|`|f3azIGajaa	Maine coon cats aren't usually a calico pattern but rather a gray/brown tabby coloring.

If you don't have a pedigree she can't truly be considered a Maine Coon. Now, the Maine Coon is a Native American breed of cat and some of those bloodlines have obviously spread around, so what you may have is a Maine Coon look-a-like or a Maine Coon Wannabe. Ordinarily this kitty would be considered a domesic longhair or DLH, even though they may have traits like a  Maine Coon. I'd be happy to answer any question that you have. You may visit my website at www.koontyme.com  Good Luck with your kitty!|`|dNRxYEjjaa	not sure but i have a maine coon! named max|`|9f97f8a980cb5aa7360577720efbdd70aa	Maine coons do not  USUALLY have calico coloration but they can..and unless you got her from a Maine Coon breeder and paid a lot of money for her...most likely she is a domestic medium hair.  Most cats are not a specific breed..but rather a mixture of breeds or what people refer to as a "mutt".  See a photo of a Maine Coon here:  http://www.cfainc.org/breeds/profiles/ma...
S4dxECPIaa	Tracking is a fun sport if you live near a club that sponsors tracking events.  It's a great way to bond with your dog because you must learn to trust your dog.    Rally is another fairly new sport that the AKC offers at many shows.  It's a bit like obedience, but you can talk to your dog like in agility.  Again, a good bonding experience.  Getting the CGC is a great idea.  Another test that can be fun and interesting is the ATTS test.  See the website below.  It's just a one time test to see how your dog reacts to different things.   You might want to take a look at agility.  I did it with my Rottie and we earned a number of titles and had lots of fun.  If they have the venue CPE in your area, it's good for the bigger dogs because the jump heights are lower.  Another activity that I really enjoy doing with my dogs is dog assisted therapy.  We had two Akitas in our program.  They were great dogs especially in the school programs.    I have a link to the Delta Society website, which is a national group that certifies therapy dogs.  I don't know much about schutzhund other than watching it a few times.  It does look like fun and a great way to bond with your dog.  It also looks like it takes a lot of training and work.  Carting, if you can find it in your area looks like fun.  There is also Weight Pulling which I would think an Akita may do well.  Dock Diving is a fairly new dog sport.  The dog must jump after a thrown object from a dock into the water and swim back with it.  So you need a dog that likes to retrieve and likes to swim.    As you can see, there are lots of choices.  All are good because they help create a special bond between you and your dog.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	That sounds like a good idea- you could also look into flyball.  He might like that.|`|3aa8a2be3c4d6e076b35e071c7dae818aa	carting would be good but sorry other than that im not an expert  im a pittie person myself so all i can think about is pittie events  good luck|`|Ug6Rm1exaa	Well, I'm a Schutzhund trainer / participant.  I've never seen someone try with an Akita, but I guess why not try?  If you are planning to try Schutzhund you should take your puppy to a club ASAP (assuming your dog is up-to-date on shots).  They play special games with puppies to develop prey drive, and they will help you figure out how to begin training your dog with motivational techniques for obedience ground work (it is a lot of fun).  This form of training would be good for you and your dog because many of the people in this sport have expertise in how to handle a powerful dog.    I've tried many venues of dog training, and Schutzhund is by far the most fun.  I would recommend that you visit a club (USA, DVM, or WDA).  USA is both a German Shepherd Dog Club and a Schutzhund organization.  As such they tend to have some of the most knowledgeable trainers and are the largest club, but they do have a bend toward focusing on German Shepherds.  DVM is for all-breeds, so depending on your locality I would explore this option first.      I hope it goes well for you and good luck with whatever training venue you decide on.

AA12309227	The labels on any pet food product should tell you how much to feed a dog or cat depending on their size.  Go by that scale.  If you feed him both wet and dry foods, then you can use your best judgment on how much to take away from the ammount on the lables to balance the two.      I give my cat wet and dry foods.  Instead of giving the full recommended cups of cat food daily, I half one of those to compensate for the wet can of food she gets at night.|`|3VDInufAaa	it tells u on the bag of food and wut king of dog is it?|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	By the sounds of things, I believe your dog is getting plenty to eat daily.

My personal suggestions:  Newfoundland  St. Bernard  Great Dane  Greyhound  Mastiff  Labrador/Golden Retriever  German Shepherd  Bernese Mountain Dog      Breeds/groups I would avoid with any children under 13yrs:  -Small terriers (Very nippy)  -Toy breeds (Too delicate & high strung)  -Pug-nosed breeds (bulldogs, pugs)   -Any sled-type breed (Very dominating)  -Dalmations (Unpredictable)  -Weimeraners (Unpredictable)  -Corgis (Bite ankles)  -Cocker Spaniels (Very tempermental)  -Chows & Sharpeis (Unpredictable)  -Dachshunds (Very delicate backs)    Good luck!|`|WaXRmgPZaa	Being thorough in your research is the way to go.  Yeah, Maggie!      I started off with looking at breeds first but found I narrowed my choices down a lot when I decided with my husband what characteristics we could or could not have in a dog.      I wanted a dog that me and the kids could really wrap our arms around and was had a reputation for being good with kids but not so active that it would take loads of my attention away from the children but that I could also do sporty activities with- so big, kid friendly, and not hyper but athletic all the same.  My husband said absolutely NO long hair.  That narrowed it down a whole lot!      I had originally pictured a Newfy but the long hair, we decided, we could not deal with.  A friend of mine had Mastiffs but when I went to visit her two 4 month old puppies they were as docile as 6 year old grown up dogs.  That was a little too calm for me.      Shepards and herding dogs were definately out of the question for us as were any shelter dogs.  We had a terrifying experience in the past with bringing a rescue dog into our home.  The dog had been "rescued" from the shelter simply because he was next on the euthanisia list and seemed okay  then was "adopted" out to us by it's rescuer.  The dog seemed perfect in every way and situation but at our home it took a swipe at my newborn baby one day (after living with us for two weeks) for no apparent reason.   Our baby could have been killed in an instant.  "Saving" any animal is not worth the life of a child or the harmony of a home.    Anyway, we tentatively decided to investigate Great Danes because what I knew of the breed, at that point, they met all our criteria.  We then began looking at breeders.      An animal exhibitor myself, I knew to begin looking online at national and state breed clubs for a breeder that was well esteemed by club members.  I checked out show records on these sites, too, for breeder's names that consistently showed up.  I found out what health tests each breeder did and what they meant.     Finally I contacted the breeder I thought I would like a dog from to see if I liked him and vice versa.  I was impressed by him, the contract, the amount of support he offered, and that he kept in contact with his puppy's new families for years and years, so we made plans to meet his current litter to pick a pet.  He helped us find a perfect temperament match for the makeup of our family and the rest is history.  We love our beautiful Dane!      I think it important for you to know that I had done lots of research and talked to several Newfy and Boxer breeders before we ever even thought of a Great Dane.      I think that the more you talk to breeders the closer you will come to finding the right dog for your family.   Keep in mind that a "good breeder" is not neccesarily someone who breeds purebred show dogs but is also someone who breeds and raises ANY dog (mixed or purebred) for a specific (working) purpose that posseses a favorable trait that makes the dog great at doing its job.  Some breeders specialize in breeding dogs with a deeply bred trait to be good with children but you'd have to ask other breeders, vets, or behaviorists, perhaps, to help you find one.      One more crucial equation in finding the perfect dog for your family is training.  Make plans for it before you bring your puppy home.  "Before You Get A Puppy" by Dr. Ian Dumbar is an excellent book and can be downloaded for free online at http://www.siriuspuppy.com .  Training clubs are a good and affordable way to go and while I have seen amazing results with our dog from taking her to this type of class I think it is the owner gets the most out of it.    Hope this helps a little.  Good luck with finding the perfect dog for your family.|`|O3q8Qvivaa	wouldn't get a shelter dog, ever with small kids, too many issues.... would get a family or kid socialized dog from a breeder. Maybe a pug, boston terrier or french bulldog. The frenchie might be cost prohibitive, but all those are good with kids. Pugs and Bostons especially so.    staffies are great, too, but insurance companies loop them in with pits, even though they are not APBT, they are the english version of the breed. excellent with kids, IF bred properly and raised correctly. They can be dog aggressive and if you are at the park or so, you will be concentrating on the kids, not the dog.... Also, any dog can be tormented and will bite, teach your children to be gentle and they will have a great pet.   by the way...  I have staffordshire bull terriers as well as rotties...and four kids.....|`|AA10173116	Lab's for sure!!!!!!!!!!|`|WyMd0zlqaa	Labs and Mastiff's are good with kids. St. Bernards and Golden Retrievers are good too. But if you want a smaller dog, Pugs, Beagles, and English Cocker Spaniels are great with kids.|`|rQROgA0Qaa	Smaller dogs generally aren't the best because they tend to be more hyper (in my experience). Based on my research of dogs, these are the ones that are great with kids:    Labs (I have one, she's like a mother to my little brother)  Golden retrievers (my dog Zeus loves children, and he's a golden)  Pit bulls (don't believe all the media hype about them...many breeds are mistaken to be "pit bulls" and so the numbers are fudged...you're more likely to be bitten by chows, rottweilers, dobermans, and even labs than by a pit bull...I've known several and my neighbor has one, and he has 2 children...he's the best dog ever!!! Most of the time the incidents you hear about are from strangers trying to pet the dog..which you should never do, no matter what dog...or the dog wasn't properly fenced in...they are truly wonderful dogs and natural "mothers" towards children).  Staffordshire Bull Terriers (very smart and great with kids...in england they are referred to as "nannies" because they are so great with kids)  Burmese Mountain Dogs (large and furry, but very good dogs)  there's a few others, but those are my top picks. I've known some and had most, and they are all fantastic dogs.|`|yG3TLjGjaa	A Golden Retriever. I have one and he is awesome with small kids. He will lay beside a baby and will protect it. He will play with older kids. He loves to be around kids of all ages. He loves to run and just to be with people. All Golden Retrievers love to be with or around people though. They love to play ball, play in the water, and just love to be around you.|`|WIamE0Feaa	I second the Staffy, great family dogs!|`|AEgyejCNaa	Seems like your home is a perfect place for an American Pit Bull Terrier or even an American Staffordshire Terrier.    All silly gossip about APBTs/Amstaffs aside... well-bred, socialized APBTs/Amstaffs are the epitome of a family dog. They're everything you want - they ADORE people and have a special connection with children, they're good for a romp around the yard or a midday nap, they're usually easy to train because they absolutely love pleasing their owners, and they're gentle.    And probably the best thing about them is that they're patient with children - a lot of dogs get annoyed when a small child pulls and tugs at it, but APBTs usually don't even mind if a child finds that pulling an ear or tail is loads of fun. No matter how well your child treats the dog, there's always bound to be a paw or tail stepped on or an accident where a child falls on a dog - so you need a dog with a stable personality... hence why I recommended an APBT/Amstaff.    Both of my parents were raised around APBTs, I was raised with APBTs, and I hope to raise my future kids around APBTs, as well.    I haven't seen a breed more loyal and loving than an APBT.|`|2805c250ba013ac4e6a04ede2b88a221aa	Dachsaund, Pug, Dalmation, Beagle.  Those were the dogs I had growing up from a small kid to college kid.  I currently have a pug they are great companion dogs, emphasis on companion.  Smaller dogs are more nervous around small children because of chidren always wanting to quickly grab, pick up, pet roughly.  However, no matter what size dog you get I recommend getting a puppy so that both the kids and the dog can grow up together, if you get an older dog it will end up having issues with the kids.  Since you say you have a large privacy-fenced yard I would go with a medium sized dog since they like to have room to run (not that small dogs don't, but the larger the dog the bigger the urge to run).  Dalmations are good with kids, but they like to pick their owners, if you ever get the chance to look at a photo of a group of people sitting with their dalmation look to see who's foot the dog is sitting on, that's their chosen master.  Smaller dogs need more attention because they are not as independent as larger dogs.  Pugs are high maintainence--wrinkles need cleaned daily in hot weather their ears need cleaned at least once a week.  Dalmations and other medium to large breeds can be bathed in a kid's play swimming pool with a garden hose.    I'm glad you are researching for the best dog to get, but here are some questions you need to ask yourself.  What kind of dog am I looking for? Answer this with a list of traits that you are hoping to get.    What kind of environment is available to the dog?  large yard, small children,  no other pets etc.  (Small apartment small dog, family home larger dog).    Will it be an inside or outside dog?    What is the breed's common personality trait?  This is a big one to look at.  Even though there are common traits with certain breeds each and every dog has their own personality, but the common personality is an average you can look at to get started.    Good luck.  Hope you find what you are looking for.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	I would suggest a beagle.  They are great with kids and with people in general.  They are loving and friendly.  They can be hard to train because they're stubborn, but you can get over this by using treats to train them.  They love food.  But with a beagle, you can trust them to be sweet and behave well with your kids.  I would suggest using a rescue, because rescues are usually very good about telling you if a dog has certain problems.  But I don't think you'll find any aggression problems with beagles.|`|RbrQgwPYaa	labrador retreiver we have owned them for a long time we have one and we love him and so does the whole family which also has a baby in the family,golden retreivers are good too,rottweilers,mastiffs,tibetan mastiffs,they are good,but hands down get a lab you will be so happy|`|12UW991Daa	Golden Retrievers are wonderful with kids and easily trained.  Small dogs can't take the rough play or accidents from kids, and will probably snap in self-defense.  Also, a young adult is better than a puppy.  They have already gone through the chewing stage, and most are housebroken by 9 mo's to 1 year old.|`|YChinX9Jaa	A lab or Golden would be my pick. And go young, under a year, so they have a chance to grow up with the kids and are not already set in there ways or uncomfortable around small children. Remember, kids move more quickly than adults and can frighten a dog, but these breeds have a natural protective instinct that makes them great kid dogs. And don't forget that your children nee ed as much training as the dog as far as being pet friendly, probably more.    Last I heard Cocker Spaniel was the leading biter in the U.S.  and small dogs tend to be hyper and nervous.  and although   Pits and Rotts can be wonderful dogs, their popularity has led to over-breeding, inbreeding and general mishandling and they can be unpredictable  and unsafe. I've known many pits that were sweet, loving lap puppies until they weren't anymore, and that change usually came about around "puberty". As much I  hate to be breed specific, I would never trust one around a child.|`|OdC8Ao9oaa	A pug puppy is great!!!!!!! I have a pug puppy and he is the most loving dog ever!!!!!

I have been involved in rescue for over six years, particularly with Pekingese and Shih Tzu and their little pals, and as you know, rescues will generally not adopt these toy breeds to folks with small children.|`|kme71ipaaa	Hi.  It is my understanding that Boston Terriers, Beagles, Labs, and Golden Retreivers are very good or any of those that are mixed in.  I would avoid the herding dogs (Heelers, Shelties) as well as Schipperkes, Westies and Dachshunds.  I'm sure there are some that are good with young children so this is a generalization.  Smaller dogs have a greater risk of being fallen on when little ones are learning to walk or being tugged on.  I wouldn't go by male/female, just by personality.|`|qBwwiSdRaa	I have to disagree with people that say, don't get a shelter dog. Not all shelter dogs have issues, and people that work at a shelter, and even more so at dog rescue organizations, evaluate the temperaments of the animals they have, so they can tell you which dogs are best with small children. This is something that is not necessarily breed specific, every dog has its own personality and temperament! In general, most rescues are hesitant to place small dogs with children because they are more fragile and many can be a little 'snappy' . I'd suggest talking to dog rescues or looking at rescue sites, they usually say with every dog's picture if it gets along with kids or not. Believe it or not, Boxers are famously good with kids, they are very patient and stoical. Again, it depends on the individual animal, not all Boxers or all Labs or Pugs are good with kids. Good luck finding a dog, and please keep a rescue animal in mind, they make great pets!|`|R47Bj9Q6aa	coton de tuler ( small breed but great with kids and other pets)  havanese(small/medium size dog playful)  king charles spanial( small but has a lot of energy )  check out dogbreedinfo.com for more info on these breeds and petfinder.com to rescue a dog.|`|3p3otDlXaa	A Staffordshire Bull Terrier|`|vxiwr1L2aa	I would get a medium sized dog that is known to be good natured.

Their coats are super easy to care for - just a bath & quick brushing every one to two wks.  They are VERY sweet & loving & gentle with children.|`|bZsrX0Ytaa	Rescue groups are generally MUCH more discriminating when it comes to finding forever homes for their animals - the dogs have already lost their family once, they try to do their best to make sure that it doesn't happen again.  ALso, they may have a dog that's already in a family with small children, so they have a better idea how the dog will react to them.    Labs and Golden Retrievers are often very even-tempered and are durable enough to deal with young kids.  Just make sure that you're not only finding the dog that will fit with your family, you're also sure that your kids understand how to treat a living being.  They need to understand that a dog can be hurt, that pulling ears and poking eyes are not acceptable, and that there are times that the dog needs to be left alone (eating, sleeping, etc.).  That "petting" is not the same as "hitting".  (I've worked in rescue and seen far too many dogs that were surrendered because the children were never taught how to treat the dog properly)    On the smaller side, maybe a Beagle?
b794d44ff9a1b1b3895ef1eac8032c0caa	This is a sign of anxiety in cats.  Grooming is a comforting behavior for them, it's likely that, as a new cat in a new place, she's very nervous and grooms herself to feel better.  I would recommend giving her a daily hairball treatment (that stuff that comes in the tubes works really well, you can buy it at a pet store) and treat her with lots of love and patience.  Make sure she has a place where she can hide when she's feeling scared (like a kitty condo, an out of the way closet or somewhere else quiet and dark) and be patient.  If the problem hasn't improved in a couple of weeks, call the vet and ask for his opinion.|`|Nl3sfXxRaa	take her to the vet as a precaution but you may want to get an oval brush used for shedding and brush her everyday. get some Iams cat food forulated to help shedding.|`|237f1ac86701e8329544cf520d189437aa	it's not that bad it's really normal cats lick themselfs cuz they r just cleanin' themselfs if u bath'em almost 1 a wk or 1 every2wks then he wont like as much|`|o00xBypeaa	I would call the vet anyways just to see|`|0G9tPIHfaa	Cats That Lick Too Much    Nellie, a seven-year-old female spayed tortoiseshell, rolled over on her back and revealed a bald belly. That's when her owner suddenly noticed she had a cat that licked too much. Licking comes naturally to cats, but sometimes this normal grooming urge crosses the line into obsessive behavior. If your cat's licking seems excessive in frequency or duration, don't ignore the problem. Here's what you can do if you suspect your cat's habitual grooming behavior isn't so normal anymore.     Cats typically spend between 30 and 50 percent of their day grooming themselves, says Pamela Perry, DVM, animal behavior resident of the Animal Behavior Clinic at Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine. "It's a huge chunk of their day," she says. "Because cats groom frequently, owners usually don't notice a problem until they observe significant hair loss or skin lesions," she adds.     Why Cats May Lick     Cats will lick when an area of their body is itchy or painful, says William Miller, Jr., VMD, a board certified specialist in dermatology and a professor at Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine. If pain is the issue, the licking is focused on the painful area, like in cases of disc disease or anal sac impaction. With itchy diseases, however, the licking is more widespread.     "We call these cats 'fur mowers,' and their problem is common in cats," Dr. Miller says. "The area being 'mowed' gives us a clue as to the cause [which can include anything from parasites in kittens to neurological diseases in older cats], but there is great overlap," he says. For example, compulsive licking at the tail head may indicate a flea infestation, while cats with pollen or food allergies may lick their backs, abdomens or other areas of the body.     Licking that causes excessive numbers of hairballs or hair loss is abnormal, Dr. Miller notes. "Bald skin is more prone to sunburn, frostbite or other environmental insults," he says. "As long as the licking doesn't break the skin's surface, no infection will occur. If the cat gets more passionate about licking and abrades the skin surface [with its rough tongue], infection can occur. Infection will intensify the licking and a vicious cycle will be set up, resulting in a serious infection," he explains.     The solution to "fur mowing" is to identify the underlying cause and correct it. "The owner can check for fleas, lice and fur mats, but beyond that, a veterinarian should intervene," Dr. Miller says.     "Over-the-top" licking does not always stem from a physical health problem; the behavior can occasionally have a psychological cause. Cats like consistency and predictability, and change can be stressful, Dr. Perry says. A recent move, the addition or loss of another pet in the home, or even a change of schedule can cause anxiety in cats. Licking - which in such cases is considered a "displacement behavior" - may calm and comfort a cat, but it can sometimes become habitual if the source of the problem is not properly identified and addressed.     When It's Stress-Related     "If all medical problems have been ruled out, then we normally treat overgrooming as the result of some form of stress in a cat's life," Dr. Perry says. If possible, she recommends making changes or introductions gradually; bringing familiar items (such as bedding) to a new home; adding cat-friendly vertical space - high places where cats can retreat and feel safe; and keeping their environment stimulating by finding a few minutes (ten to 15 minutes daily will do) to play with them each day.     "Most cats really enjoy interaction," Dr. Perry says. "Finding what your cat likes, whether it's cuddle time with you or a favorite toy that is like a security blanket, can relieve stress."     Finally, if your cat is seriously stressed, a form of temporary anti-anxiety drug therapy prescribed by your veterinarian may be warranted, she says.     In addition, like people who bite their fingernails, the repetitive act of licking may involve a stress-relieving pleasure component that reinforces the behavior, Dr. Perry says. Thus, feline licking can become a habit that persists after the cause is identified and resolved. "Usually, the behavior is forgotten [naturally or with the help of medication] in about a month," Dr. Miller says.     Whether the cause is physiological or psychological, solving an overgrooming problem will require time and patience on the owner's part. For Nellie, who had recently endured the loss of a companion animal in her home, the solution required consistent attention, affection and routine. It took a few months, but her hair is growing back and her life has returned to normal.   http://www.vet.cornell.edu/fhc/news/lick...
Sh6u3qfAaa	Two problems, energy and biting.    For the excess energy, just walk her 30 minutes in the morning and 30 minutes in the evening.... maybe a little less because she is young.... Walk her until she starts to look hot or tired... then be prepared to carry her... But no more than 30 minutes.    Bite inhibition:  Stop the puppy from nipping now, because she will bite when she's big pounds. Not good.  1. When she nips you, then yelp. She will startle. Then pet her.  2. If she nips you a second time (they are hard headed), then yelp, and turn your back for 15 seconds. If she comes around and barks, then accept that as an apology. In either case, pet her and praise her.  3. If she nips you a third time, turn around for two minutes. This is a very long time....then pet and praise her.  4. If she nips you a fourth time (very possible), then yelp, and get up and leave the area. Don't move her, you get up and leave her alone. Stay away for 5 -10 minutes. Then you can return, or just go about your business.  5. Every time you interact with her, go thru this process. By the second day, she should start to learn.    In the litter, siblings will play by biting. If one bites too hard the other will yelp. If he keeps biting, the other will go away and won't play. Sometimes the biter will realize and will apologize. Sometimes he will forget... but this is the process that puppies go thru. This works very well with labs... and You can use this approach for training other things.|`|VS5qCFsbaa	it is normal puppy behaviour, but this does need to be delt with.  try a spray bottle, keep it around and spray her in the face with water whenever she bites.|`|a3af0d3b5b8da3cbc372563bd7815a41aa	The term is Bitchin' Puppy, and bitchin' things bite.|`|vIGqV8QUaa	take her out for a walk 3 times a day buy her a chew toy and buy a very big cage and put a whole bunch of chew toys and old pillows in it then keep her in there until you take her for a walk|`|P1mi6pUYaa	Wow.

mucRUe7Caa	It's not true that large and giant breeds should not be fed puppy food. Rather, they should be fed food that has the proper amounts of the right nutrients.     There is speculation that there are three dietary conditions that encourage rapid growth in large/giant breed puppies - calcium, energy, and protein. Danes, especially, should be eating food that contains the lower end of calcium values (for example, .9%-1.2%). Any kibble with 2% or more contains too much calcium for a Dane puppy. Also, energy = calories. The more calories the kibble has, the more you feed, the more rapidly your puppy will grow. Find a kibble that contains less Kcal per cup. It's difficult to gauge how much protein in a kibble is actually usable. Generally, though, if the excess protein is not used, it is converted into energy/calories that will, again, contribute to rapid growth.    For what it's worth, I used Innova Large Breed Puppy for my Dobe, but I know plenty of Dane owners who like Eagle Pack. And then I know plenty of other puppy owners who feed Canidae for all life stages =) It's all up to you, and they're all good foods.|`|f601a619938c665bc66cf8c63e64d226aa	I would buy Canidae, its the food we were going to get our dogs, but we had to get Blue Buffalo instead.|`|YJmGf4RLaa	large & giant breed puppies should not be fed puppy food.

Eagle Pack makes a holistic food,  but also some lesser quality of the same name - so you need to be careful if buying.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	A lot of the holistic foods are really good.  You did a lot of research on Canidae, so you know a lot about it.  What about this brand?  Do some research on it and see if it sounds better.  I do prefer the holistic type foods for my dog.  I get him food that's made with human grade ingredients and that way I know he's not eating garbage.|`|M1at6KE9aa	Both are excellent foods.  I happen to feed Canidae because it works well for my small dogs.  However, either brand is excellent dog food.  Also watch for corn, wheat or soy in the recipe.  You want to avoid those.  The holistic varieties of Eagle Pack tend to have better ingredients while the others have corn fairly high up on the list of ingredients.  If the Eagle Pack holistic is higher in protein, I would go with that.      My dogs have done very well on the Canidae.  When I started using it about a year ago, the store where I buy sold hardly any of it at all.  Word has gotten around about it and it is now their best selling dog food.  As I mentioned before, it has worked well for me.
9kB3xQrFaa	People ask the questions when it becomes relevant to them.  A lot of young people use this site and it may not occur to them to look at the history of similar questions.  You raise a good point!|`|AA12285639	Well...most people are just playing the YahooAnswers game.  Meaning...no one would earn points if questions were not asked over and over.  It doesn't bother me.      What bothers me is seeing questions like this:  "I have a problem?" or "I need help fast?" or "What would you do?"      Questions need to be more detailed...for instance "I have a problem with my cat?" or "I need help fast choosing the right cage for my rabbit?" or "What would you do with this ferret?"      I always skip over questions if I don't know what animal the asker is asking about...and I'm not gonna click into and read the thousand of them to find out.  :)|`|c56769faa6a17951afc2da21c4ffceeeaa	People are lazy, and they don't read.|`|FnSskhcQaa	I agree.

2be14aaeddfaa187fb19a7f9392bf657aa	She should have been spayed at the time her uterus ruptured..if she went to a good vet then that is exactly waht would have happened..no repair involved.|`|fqiwCpx9aa	I would get a second opinion.  Most vets will remove the uterus entirely if it is ruptured...and they will clean it up properly...|`|fAkHJjn2aa	Give her time to recuperate and then take her to 3 or 4 different vets to get more opinions.  I'm sure they will have to run some tests to see how well she healed from the trauma, but if her recovery is successful, they should be able to spay her later on.    What gets me, is why didn't the first vet spay her while he was in there repairing the damage?  That would seem like the logical solution, but maybe he had a good reason...|`|eab09710c69a5ac7776d5769337649a6aa	I,  too ,  am astonished that the vet just did not remove the damaged uterus -- if she should get accidently bred again,  her life would be in danger.  I would wait talk to other vets,  now anbout her case.  Perhaps even go to the veterinary school in your state if it has a good reputation -- there are often specialists there.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	Give her time.  It won't hurt to let her have extra time to heal and feel better.  Then take her to a different vet to get a second opinion.  It's best to spay your dog, but not if it's going to hurt her.  Good luck!

Try james wellbeloved food slowly mixing in so within one week the dog has finally changed over turkey/rice  Give your dog tuna in sunflower oil,drain off the oil & mix in 1/3 of the tuna 1/2 can (just the small cans) if your dog is medium/large.  Your dog is lacking in oils, you give them this to help there skin/coat/nails from becoming dry/brittle etc.  If this is not going on all the time, have you paid attention to when he/she is getting it? time of the month? feeding table scraps etc change in your dogs diet that it does not usually get.

So, she started getting all dandruffy again most of the time. One day, while I was taking a shower, she got curious and jumped in the shower with me. I figured since she was in there, I would shampoo her. After that, she started jumping in the shower with me a lot more and she started getting washed a lot more. Miraculously, her dandruff went away!     The lesson of today's story is that every dog is unique. For some dogs, that might have made their dandruff worse, but for mine, it helped get rid of it. Try lots of stuff. Try giving her more baths, less baths, and ask her vet about what dog  foods, vitamins, or shampoos could help her.

Then use the shampoo every two to four weeks."
P1mi6pUYaa	Dalmatians are super high-energy puppies for life.  I would only recommend one if you have a lot of land for him to run around on or you go running every day and are willing to take him with you.  I have also known several Dalmatians that have killed their owner's other, smaller pets, like Chinchillas or cats.  So I don't think I'd trust one with small kids.  But if your kids are older and you can handle the energy level, maybe a Dalmatian is for you.|`|aJRP6WWYaa	Their hyper dogs and they have been known to turn on their owners.

I grew up with one and he was fine with us, but I think its because of the training he went through and that we all grew up together.|`|mh5WiYRdaa	Some can be aggressive if not properly raised. Fifty percent of people who adopt a Dalmatian puppy do not keep them past the first year. Young Dalmatians are very energetic, however they do calm down after a few years and people who keep them long enough to get past their active stage tend to be very pleased. If you are thinking about adopting a Dalmatian puppy be sure you have the time and energy for them. If you are a very active person with room for the dog to run, a Dalmatian may be right for you.     The Dalmatian enjoys playing with children, but may be too rambunctious for toddlers. They get along well with other pets, but some may be aggressive with strange dogs; males often dislike other males. Somewhat high-strung, and can be timid without enough socialization.      so to sum up Yes. But it depends on how younge the child is..  a dog of any breed shoudl not be left alone with a child|`|CCgfJ3tjaa	if raised fro puppy hood  one i now nips  but has never punctured skin  hes not very well trained  go to http://www.couleehumane.com/adoption.htm  they have a dalmation  if i was going for a gentle giant  id get a bloodhound  they will let kids full tail fur and ears and just taking it|`|fuDqQtW0aa	some are.

Does he get sufficient exercise for this very high energy breed?|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	It depends on how good the breeding is and how well socialized they are.  Dalmatians can be great dogs, but they can also be unpredictable and unstable in the hands of bad breeders. Years ago they were very overbred, and so there are many lines that I would not own a dog from.   But there are also reputable breeders that still breed from stable lines and produce great dogs.  Just do your research on the breeder and then properly socialize the dog from a young age, and the dog will do great!|`|BbuC28Qcaa	Any breed can be, if raised around them, properly trained, and exercised.    HOWEVER, any breed can also be snappy, if they have a kid pulling at their tail. Keep that in mind-teach your kids to respect our furry friends. :o)
KDYDBD8Jaa	police   dog|`|LPEO6AsCaa	The simplest thing to do until you finds something in your area is to get your Shepherd a dog back pack.  When your going out for a walk put it on him and fill the side pockets with  a few water bottles and a collapsible dish.  Let him carry this.  It give dogs a sense of doing a job and he can have a drink along the way.  I have them for my 2 Golden's and they love to walk with them on.|`|d00bc047d5b2cbd7a719a3772346f4e6aa	GSD's are of the herding variety, tho I imagine that's a difficult one to persue in the city.  But there are plenty of doggie sports you can persue to keep your dog happy.    Just doing regular basic to advanced obedience training has been a huge help with our BC puppy.  It gives her a job and something to focus on.    There's also things like Agility, Flyball and a real easy one, that doesn't require much for professional training is Frisbee.  Any of these will adequately excercise your dog and give him a "job" to do.  It doesn't have to be a real job of necessity, just something to keep him entertained and active regularly.|`|a240f6a29595325552c0b7c4b59c17beaa	Security.  Hey, he's a German Sheppard after all.|`|6291ffb2e8083ad82d6e6f85f69b35c0aa	You don't have to think of big JOBS.  Your dog needs two things: 1. lots of exercise.  I hope you are taking it for long walks.  2. intellectual stimulation.      If your dog had a job (like SAR or a seeing eye), it could get those two together.  But since you are in the city, you'lll have to do it separately.     For intellectual stimulation, teach commands or tricks.  My puppy is half GS and she is only 13 weeks old.  She already knows: sit, down, fetch, come, go get in your crate, stay, let's go, drop it, and go potty.  We are having trouble with go potty right now, but she has learned all the others quickly.  Practicing these commands is her job.  She has to work to get a treat and attention.    Depending on how well your dog learns, teach him other things.  My room mate's GS could bring her leash, open the fridge and bring a beer or whatever can drink she had in a certain spot, open the pantry to get her own treat (that caused problems if we left her out while not home), that sort of thing.  We also used to show her the treat, then make her wait while we went into another room to hide it.  Then we released her to go into the room and search for the treat.  Sometimes it took her 10 to 15 minutes to find it.|`|r7TOAUjIaa	Here is one of the easiest jobs for a German Shepherd, but will be very rewarding for not only you, but for him as well.  Since you live in the city, I am assuming that you walk him regularly.  IU own Two GSDs and I walk them both about 4 miles a day since we live in an apartment.  Get a doggy backpack, I provided a link for you below.  When you take him on your walk, put a few bottles of water, well actually make it an even number to get the right weight.  But you see, the weight will mean that he is carrying it for you and him.  You can also get a travel water bowl for him to carry, and even some of the backpacks listed have them already.  You will find that not only does this give him a job, but it will give him twice the excerise.  A 30 minute walk will seem like an hour.  BTW, this idea is not my own, it is one I have seen and heard on several training shows like "The Dog Whisperer" and "IT's Me or the Dog".|`|da357e4dca3808347fca0ff62f99f424aa	I have one and he is happy just to carry my bag or help get the laundry out of the dryer.Teach him to carry , he will do it proudly .I am not sure what he could do overall as the BIG job,lol!|`|28h8NMqnaa	There are all sorts of activities you can do with your German Shepherd. Getting involved in a dog sport is probably your best bet. Shepherds excel in all dog sports -- rally, obedience, agility, tracking.     The internet is your best tool for finding an activity you can both get involved in. Good luck.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	You mean work to keep him busy and out of trouble?  Try a busy ball (one you fill with treats and he noses around to get them out one by one).  There are also toys that are like puzzles, like the Hide-A-Squirrel ones.  You could take him to an agility class so he can learn agility and then go to an agility course when you are able.  They have doggie spas with swimming pools, if he likes water.  You could take him to search and rescue training or canine good citizen training if you really wanted to.  Then he'd get time doing exactly what he was born to do.  Or you could take him to the dog park so he can run around and burn some energy off.|`|aqEMiZMyaa	There is no rule of law as to what "work" they need....perhaps his job should be being a good pet.....that can be reward enough if he is successfully rewarded for it....but if your hell bent on him working perhaps he could do visits to nursing homes or such......|`|XyYA993gaa	police dog they are veery good with that

IZKDKXWhaa	It's been my experience that the problem isn't your dog... it's that there is urine smell in the carpet in your home now.  They tend to go where they've gone before.  If you can really clean the carpet... even better take it up and clean the pad or replace the pad, too.  Then you can start training them again.  Our dog kept going on the carpet in the bedroom -- 5 feet from it's doggy door!!  We finally replaced the carpet with hardwood floors and she started using the doggy door right away.  It's frustrating when they don't get it, but hang in there.  Don't ever smack or hit the dog tho.  They want to please you.  Good luck!|`|cd0188d1b2920c5a4312a8e14b0eb846aa	when did you get it?  have you had it since it was a puppy?  there are these little potty training pads you can get dogs, and you doggy is a little one so it would work, its jus a pee pad for them to use inside  id try it!|`|P1mi6pUYaa	Crate train your dog.  Get a crate that is small for his size and put him in it while you're at work or away.  When you come home, take him outside immediately.  When he goes potty outside, praise him a lot, give him treats and pets.  Keep doing this until he gets the idea on his own.  You'll have to watch him carefully to see how he tries to warn you he needs outside.  Also, take him outside often so he has lots of chances to be a "good dog".  It also helps to crate him at night.
8phMfVERaa	not per se, but if you find a pup whose parents are of smallish size for the breed, you can be pretty sure of a smallish sized dog, as compared to average size for the breed.  My uncle has one, smallish, but by no means miniature, and she's wonderful,. Good personalitied breed, decent temperament, eager to please as a rule....Yeah, good choice, a goldie|`|vJVvI8huaa	No, Pure breed Golden retrievers only come "Standard". You might want to do some research into other smaller breeds and find the one best suited to you and your family.  Try these websites:  http://www.akc.org/  http://www.ckc.ca/en/    Good Luck!|`|P1mi6pUYaa	I don't think there's a half size one, but you could get one that is expected to be on the small side.  It would still be a big dog, though.  The do need a lot of exercise, and you should be careful to train the puppy not to jump on people, etc before he gets too big (because of your kids).  But Goldens are an excellent family dog.  Try looking on petfinder.com for a smaller Golden or a Golden mix- you'd be saving the pup's life and you could choose the size of the dog.  Good luck!|`|i8sqqZEmaa	never heard of that before.  in the long run you will be thankful you got a golden retriever though, they are one of the best family dogs.  they are great with kids and very loving dogs, yet protective when they need to be.  my parents like to say that the golden we had helped raise my sister and I because she would play with us, protect us, sleep next to us etc.  My mom never had to worry about us outside because our dog was always at our side and kept us corralled and inline.|`|28h8NMqnaa	Doesn't exist I am afraid. Golden Retrievers are medium/large sized dogs. Run a mile from any breeder who offers 'half size' or petite Goldens -- they are probably mixed bred and badly bred.    If you are looking for a smaller family dog, look into another breed. Try a Cocker or Springer Spaniel.    If you are dead set on a Golden, try getting a female from working lines. A working line female will be smaller and leaner than a show bred dog. They are still large/medium regardless but there is a big difference between the two lines.    Good luck!|`|ogX2EUs8aa	It might take some work, but look for breeders who own both dogs, and you can see both parents to see roughly how big the puppy will be|`|rMb40fysaa	I don't think there is, but Golden Retrievers are great dogs. They are easy to train and friendly towards other people. Your puppy may seem a little wild at first but don't get discouraged. Once they're a little older and trained, they will behave better.
b84334dc4c69c929f51e2aaa4f84ec25aa	First thing you have to do with a dog is us the same dry food. Dry food is the best because it cleans there teeth and it is not full of water. Until house broke, the dog should only be feed once a day at the same time every day. Walk the dog after you feed it. And I mean walk do not just stand there. Then walk him again a half hour after that. You should walk him as many times a day as you can until house broke. Walking helps it pass the food. Walk it in the same place every day. When they smell there own potty it makes them have to go. When the dog goes in the house, clean it up with vinegar. This does 2 things kills the smell+vinegar has a urine bass smell and the dog thinks you r marking this as your turf. When the dog goes in the house put the potty outside where you want it to go. Remember smelling his potty makes him want to go. So no potty smell in the house but lots of potty smell outside. You should have a pin or create just big enough for him to lie down. Most dog will not potty where they lay. Do not put anything in the pin that will soak up pee. When you are not watching your dog, he should be in the pin. If he goes in the house, you should catch him in the act and grab him and yell no then take him outside. Clean it up and take the potty outside. So to rap this up. Walk him as much as you can tell him good boy when he goes outside. When your not watching him keep him it the pin. When he goes inside tell him bad boy and take him outside..|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Yep, that's why it's good to crate train to start with if the goal is for him to go outside in the long run.  This is a helpful website on crate training that should help you a lot.  You basically will have to restart housebreaking from scratch since he's confused now about what's expected of him.    http://www.inch.com/~dogs/cratetraining....|`|P1mi6pUYaa	Maybe.  But try putting some newspapers outside.  Then bring him out often so he can get the idea.  Praise him when he goes outside.|`|zw4Yncf3aa	You want to prevent them from going inside and then praise them for going outside.  If there is an accident, you have to catch them in the act and bring them outside.  If your dog thinks that going outside is a reward for pooping inside, you need to concentrate on taking him outside at the right time.  Since he is 1.5 years old, you should know when he needs to relieve himself.  He isn't a puppy, so he doesn't need to go every hour or anything.  Pay attention to his usual schedule of going to the bathroom and make sure you watch him like a hawk and take him outside if he starts to sniff around and act suspicious.      About the crate -- he pooped in the crate?  Make sure the crate is not too big for him.  If he can poop in one side and still lay down in the other side, it is too big for him.  If he only has enough space to lay down comfortably, most dogs will not poop/pee in their crate.  They don't want to lay in it.  So, make sure it's the right size crate.|`|3VqP7cv1aa	The only suggestion I can make is that you treat him as though he were a puppy.  Take him out regularly.  And when he goes outside, give him treats.  But, you have to give him more than just a pee break. He needs the chance to sniff around and whatever then he'll realize "oh! I have to poo!"  And he'll go.  Watch for signs, they start pacing, sniffing the floor, acting all anxious.  Sometimes he might even follow you around gawking at you as if to say "hello!  i have to go out!!!" If he is taught now to go on paper then you need to slowly move that paper towards the door.  And eventually outside...then get rid of it all together.  He needs to see that the paper is where he goes, but now the paper goes outside....so HEY!  I go outside!!!!  Know what I mean?  Be persistent and clean up any accidents as soon as possible.  I heard that rubbing his nose in it actually make them think that pooing was bad, they don't associate the bad behavior as going on the floor, but just going was bad...so stay away from disciplining Fido for accidents.  Just immediately take him outside.  If you start taking him out every 2 hours he'll get the idea that he can hold it for when he goes out.  It takes a little while, especially since he's already trained to go on paper.  Good luck!|`|4d522d96c496eca7eee9797d48cce584aa	maybe you should take him out in the morning and in the after noon and  or when ever you feed him because they will sometimes they will forget.

However, vets know this and so they try to use the very minimum amount that will work.  This is the safest and most reasonable way to use them.  It is when they have high doses all the time that the steroid is hard on their organs.|`|bGnYnFGuaa	Steriods are usually for short term and long term treatment. Like for instance, when a dog gets out of surgery they can put him on steriods for treatment and recovery, take him of the steriod and see how he does.     I would personally not let your dog be as "puppy-ish" as she would like, as it can do more damage then help.       Yes steriods can be long term just be careful ;-)      Claire & Trix|`|3BQUIn6Vaa	It  may be short term. Your vet will tell you.  I had my older lab on steriods because she had bad allergies in the summertime.  The vet kept a close tab on her, and when blood tests showed it was affecting her kidneys, we stopped using the steriods.  When on the steriods, she was a beautful dog, when not, an itchy dog, but one that lived a long life (amost 13 years) without premature kidney failure.  Good luck, your dog may live however long it can and will have the longest lifespan because of all the TLC you have given it.

Many dogs in stores are from puppy mills ( visit www.stoppuppymills.com) and are in ill health. Dogs that are rescued are very good- they are grateful to be saved. PLEASE get a rescue dog.|`|7vEljRzPaa	MYSPACE IT DO HELP A  LOT|`|HdNmPwmYaa	If you are really waiting 2 years, registering with petfinder until you find a pure bred (even  few months or another year) does seem like a small price to pay to rescue a dog or give a homeless a good home.  Even if it means adopting out of your area (I am sure you will be willing to pay for transport fees, etc). You could even make it a roadtrip and go fetch the dog yourself.  Try Braveheart Pit Bull Recue http://www.braveheartrescue.com/.  I surely DO see a few pure breds there?  As someone else said - PLEASE find it in your heart to adopt a needy dog!
OG0J4DSQaa	Talk to your family members and find one person who can be responsible for your dog.    Place a TO DO list  (daily, monthly or yearly items ) for her on the fridge so she wont forget what needs to be done and the date.    Bring this list with you too so you can call and remind them to do what needs to get done.    All the best! No worries, Be positive your family will help out.|`|a5BJjZVsaa	do you have a responsable friend that could take care of her while you are gone|`|S7UEqSMVaa	You said you couldn't take her with you yet, right? If so, let a family member that you most trust in the meanwhile to take care of her. Then when your ready to take her with you, your all set.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	Hopefully, if you talk to someone in your family, they will understand how important she is to you and take care of her.  Otherwise, you'll have to find someone outside the family to keep her.  You can't make someone take care of her if they don't want to, though.  But hopefully someone will step up when you leave....|`|AA10286336	Just an idea....sit down with the family members that are going to be in charge of her care and let them know what the dog needs and all of that. Tell them also, that if they have any questions, they may call you. Another idea, make a list of daily things that need to be done with your dog, and then weekly and how often it needs to go to the vet etc. Maybe that will help them to realize what has to be done. If the family cannot take on the reesponsibility or doesn't want to, then maybe a friend or church member could. I know for a fact that the elderly LOVE taking care of animals. It makes them feel loved and nurtures there maternal/paternal instincts from when their kids were little. So, if family doesn't work out, maybe ask a neighbor who is elderly or someone from a church and offer to pay them a monthly amount plus the cost of food and taking them to the vet. I'm sure it will all fall into place for you. Good Luck though!|`|cMfz5Hvdaa	ask one person to do her meds, one to groom her, one for shots, one for water, or maybe two for one person, etc. that way not one person has too much responsibility.|`|fdc6fbfb1b0c78c29cedb911da91c74baa	Gee Whiz, guess you will have to trust your family members kiddo...

pZmIr9myaa	Here is some useful info for your question.    Dogs are natural hunters and carnivores. Although a dog has been domesticated for thousands of years, its internal digestive system has remained virtually unchanged - a very short intestinal tract geared to the consumption and digestion of raw meat. The balanced raw meat dog food diet is becoming the new standard.    Better in the Raw Dog Food is a human grade dry ingredient pre-mix for preparing a balanced canine diet. No grains of any kind are used. Just add meat and water. For convenience, the finished product can be frozen as individual portions for storage and thawed as needed.    THE COST TO FEED THIS WHOLESOME DIET IS $2.00-$3 PER DAY FOR A 50 LB DOG - BASED ON FEEDING 1 LB PER DAY.     The resulting food is a complete and balanced diet for dogs of all ages. When feeding Better in the Raw Dog Food, no additional food or vitamin and mineral supplements of any kind are required. Treats, of course, are the exception.     Nutrients present in these fresh ingredients are easily absorbed, thereby helping to alleviate your pet from dietary influenced diseases that may be caused by commercial pet foods that may be deficient in key nutrients.     List of benefits:    Weight Control   Clean teeth and gums  tartar disappears   Increased mental acuity   Less water consumption   More lustrous coat   Anal gland impaction alleviated   Increased energy   No more dry, itchy skin, hot spots or alopecia   Increased muscle mass   Ear problems alleviated   Less backyard cleanup   Most allergies disappear   No doggy odor   Fewer Veterinary bills     Order online at:  http://www.knowbetterdogfood.com/product...|`|O3q8Qvivaa	I would get the EP in the orange bag, it is what  I feed my dog when showing and working.  I also think because you have a high energy dog this would be best for him. look up www.eaglepack.com, it will help you with locations that sell it and tell  you about all of the foods they make.. I think it is their "super", I fogot the name, it is the orange bag... sorry, I have a headache right now..|`|P1mi6pUYaa	I really like California Natural dog food.  It's not sold at Petsmart or Petco.  I get it at a smaller pet supply shop near my house.  They have a website, though:    http://www.naturapet.com/    The company also makes EVO and Innova, which I've heard are also excellent brands.  Their foods were never recalled like most others were, because they use all human grade ingredients.  There are no preservatives, either.  Compare their ingredients list with a regular brand of dog food, and you'll see what I mean.  All the ingredients are normal and natural, and there's not a bunch of filler or crap in it.      In my area, I buy the large bag for about $40 for a 40 lb bag, I believe.  You can get smaller ones, though.|`|J7qp6lMHaa	Timberwolf - Organic, about $10.00 for 15 pd bag, they ship for free, or call local smaller pet stores to see if they carry it.|`|oaJN7UNWaa	My husband and I make our own dog food. We have a 20 pound mini schnauzer and an 85 pound giant schnauzer. We use a simple recipe that is approved by our vet:  1/3 portion protein  1/3 portion vegetable  1/3 portion starch    We then add in a supplement to cover any missed vitamins, etc.     The dogs love it! We have seen dramatic improvement in behavior, energy, and skin & coat.  You should look into the book "Smarter than You Think" by Paul Loeb. He gives portions by weight. Our little one gets 2/3 cup each protein/veggie/starch, while the big guy gets a full 2 cups+ each.    The best part of all is that you can completely regulate what goes into the dog's food. And you totally control the amount of "filler" they get, which in my mind is pointless for them to have.    (Just be sure to avoid onions, chocolate, raisins & grapes- all very bad for doggies!)
0xJZJggVaa	Bless you for adopting a dog.    First of all bathe her now by all means! No reason you can't while she's in heat.    She should quit bleeding within a few days. Wait a couple weeks before you spay her. You can call the shelter and make the appointment now, they might even spay her when she's in heat. Some do.    Good Luck with your Pup!

I would try to keep her cleaned up as best as possible, that way she doesn't develop some kind of infection.  If the bleeding doesn't stop, you should call a vet and get their advice.

P1mi6pUYaa	My foster dog barks at people cause she's scared of them.  I have been carying treats and giving her one every time we see a person, no matter what her reaction is.  Now she's starting to associate people with good things.  Don't try to squirt the dog or spank him; that just makes them more scared and excited.  Try to associate people with good things the dog likes.|`|vDvSh092aa	Everytime this happens, call out "Chi, no! no!" and use your index finger as a pointer. If the habit changes, say a car goes by and Chi doesn't bark, then praise him. Take along some dog treats, and you'll see. The dog wants to please you, not disobey you, and doesn't know what you want him to do. He thinks he's protecting you. If you let him know that if something is approaching, or if someone is walking by, or while driving, tell Chi that it's okay in a calm voice and he will realize that there is no danger. Talk to him, and soon he will stop the barking at everything. Oh, and praise him if he barks for a REAL reason. Enjoy him! steve|`|deRunk61aa	Reward him for quiet behavior. This is a situation where a clicker works well--click when the dog is silent, even for a moment, and follow up with a yummy food reward. I did this with my dog, who was very, very barky and reactive around other dogs--at first, the only time I could click was when she was inhaling to start another round of barks. But she quickly caught on, and as she started to be quiet and relax longer I began to use a word, "quiet," to name her behavior. She's still not fond of strange dogs, but she will shut up on command.    Especially in the beginning it will be easier to work on this at home than in the car, when you're presumably having to pay attention to the road. Put him in a covered carrier--he won't bark at what he can't see.    Yelling at or squirting a dog who is already upset or excited is just going to make things worse.

Judging from her fine coat though and the way she is licking her lips, you are dong a great job of keeping her healthy. Keep up the good work.    PS: She should not get over 100 pounds when she is fully mature. If she does, contact her breeder, I am sure he/she would be happy to help you.|`|XEbrGfZuaa	There are no guarantees in dog breeding with toys or tea cups.  I have read many accounts informing me, that there  are no tots, and there are only "runts" from a litter. We have  a toy/runt, that's grown since we got her. She had two pups  in her first litter. One was a standard Chi, and the other a toy/runt as herself. I used to fit her on one arm and she's hanging over now.     We bought our first Chi, thinking she'd stay small in the  toy size. But she kept growing until she was about two. I  guess the breeder knew by the time she was fully grown, we'd be too attached to give her back. She's classified as a Deer Chihuahua. And she's at least twice the size of the overgrown Toy. They are good and affectionate little dogs, & make good companions, no matter what their size though.  So there's not much you can do, except tp continue to love her  and enjoy her, for the rest of her little life.|`|uUYdkjCFaa	love the pic.  Cutest chihuahua I've ever seen LOL  :D|`|cB585JJMaa	Shell still grow, all dogs grow, but she wont get much bigger.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	LOL :D    That was funny!|`|M1at6KE9aa	There is no such thing as a teacup Chihuahua.  That is a marketing term used to take people's money.  There is only one Chihuahua breed.  Dogs can range in weight from two to six pounds for show.  Many Chihuahuas are much larger and weigh ten to twelve pounds.  The larger dogs tend to be much hardier than their tiny counterparts so the breeder may have done you a favor.  :-)  NO ONE can guarantee the size of a Chihuahua at adulthood - not even show breeders.     According to the official A.K.C. Standard, the Chihuahua comes in two varieties or coat types. There are smooth coats and long coats.  This is the only distinction between the two varieties.  Other than length of coat, they are exactly the same breed.     Chihuahuas are the smallest of all breeds belonging to the Toy Group and, for show purposes, they should not exceed six pounds.  There are many Chihuahuas who are nice dogs but over the weight allowed in the show ring.  They are perfectly normal and often make better family pets than their smaller, more delicate counterparts.  However, the goal of every breeder should be to produce high quality dogs in accordance with the AKC standard.    There are also those who remain very small throughout their lives.  In most breeds we would call these exceptionally tiny dogs "runts" and they would sell for less than a normal size dog.  Sadly, this is often not the case with Chihuahuas.  The terms pocket-size, tinies, and teacups are but a few of the frequently used marketing terms to describe these exceptionally small dogs - some of which weigh less than two pounds.  There are breeders who deliberately breed extra small puppies claiming they are rare and selling them for exorbitant prices.  However, these tiny dogs frequently have serious health issues that result in exorbitant medical costs and early death.     Hydrocephalus, heart problems and a short life span are only the beginning of the heartache one can encounter with these exceptionally small dogs and the prospective owner needs to be prepared to meet the extra medical costs that may be associated with owning one.    While it may look cute or cool to carry a tiny dog around in a shirt pocket, one must also consider the possible health risks and be prepared financially and emotionally to support the medical needs of such a delicate dog.  The average life span of these tiny Chihuahuas is about three and a half years compared to over fifteen years for a normal size, healthy Chihuahua.       While not all tiny Chihuahuas are unhealthy, a sizable percentage of them are and the unsuspecting buyer is often left with huge vet bills after a tragic outcome.  We appreciate the fact that some people prefer the smaller dogs.  However, they should never be sold at a higher price than one would pay for a normal size Chihuahua and the breeder should provide a written guarantee to either replace the dog or refund the purchaser's money if the dog is determined to have an inherited defect.       Beware of any breeder who advertises their dogs as Rare, Pocket-Size, Tinies, or Teacups.  These terms are deliberately misleading and used for only one purpose:   TO TAKE YOUR MONEY!  Despite many claims to the contrary: there is no such thing as a teacup Chihuahua!|`|QEUcGYqcaa	did you see the mom and dad alot of breeders lie about size i have a male 1 year old and hes 4 and a half pds. he's not a teacup a teacup is about 3 pounds

The vet recommended ACCENT (for people in the spice isle at the grocery store). We added 1 teaspoons over her food twice a day. It took 2 days to kick in. We continued to it for 5 days, then cut it back to only once a day for 5 days, then down to every other day, then twice a week, once a week, and that was it.....she hasn't done it since, and it's been 2 yrs.

You should wash your dog and treat it with a flea/tick shampoo.  If you dog is very dirty. Then wash with your dog with plain hair shampoo from your bathroom then a dog shampoo with flea/tick in it.  Then treat the area your dog is in.  You have to take your dog out of that area for at least a day.  Then treat your dog with a product called front line/bio spot or another treatment where you put it on it's back down to his butt area.  It helps but doesn't keep them all away.    If you are removing them from the dog, make sure you pull out the head as well the body.  They don't die easily.  You should flush them down the toilet.  I do.  That way they don't invest my house.  Finding them in your bed, can't fun.  They carry diseases that could cause you to go to the doctors.    If you dog has ALOT of ticks on him.  Then I would take your dog to the vet.  Ticks can kill a dog especially small ones due to them sucking the blood out of the animal.      Good luck.
bUtl3fDkaa	A dog is a deterrent.  A dog is an "alarm".  If you want protection, get a gun.    http://images.libertyoutlet.com/prod/p-a...    (Also, don't rely solely on the police for protection; in the time it takes them to respond, everything already done and over with. They'll get there in time to take a report of the incident, not to prevent it.)  .|`|VrOapNUlaa	they are  a deterent for people breaking in and also from people wandering into your yard. Just get a gun and you will feel safer.|`|wOBxFW1taa	I agree. Although some large dogs may scare away some intruders most of them will lick the person to death once they get in the house. Some may not even notice people coming in during the night. The best defense against a thief or violence would be an alarm system or pepper spray. Also in big cities women should not go out alone at night a dog may help to keep people away but they are not a cure all to keep you 100% safe.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	Some people are afraid and they think a dog will protect them.  The truth is that dogs are a good deterent to thieves and would be attackers.  I have a beagle, too, who would probably kiss an intruder to death.  But dogs in general deter criminals just because of their presence.  Dogs have excellent hearing and smell, and lots of people are afraid of them.  They bark to alert their owners when something is wrong.  I don't think it's such a bad thing to want a dog who is good at this stuff.  But a dog is primarily a pet for most people.|`|fdc238a041e621b4c0ba8feabf253058aa	Simple answer. Your dog is there right NOW. How long for the police to arrive.

i0bbjr2Haa	Well, 3 dogs become a pack which can be a problem with some dogs. You may want to talk to your vet before you get the dog.They can give you a very good opinion.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	It doesn't have to be.  They might accept the puppy as part of their pack.  This will probably go better if the new puppy is naturally submissive.  Make sure to give them a good introduction off their territory and with lots of treats.  Over time, even if they don't get along at first, they will probably be fine together.  But since the new one is a puppy, the chances are even better.  Good luck!|`|uYnfSYvWaa	the new puppy is not a submissive breed but is smart enough to probably get the point he shouldnt fight.|`|KeevlZnTaa	It really depends on the dogs. I have an 11 year old JRT, she is great with other dogs. I recently got a puppy, whom she doesn't like. The puppy is jumpy, yippy, and wants to play all the time. My Jack is not interested in the pup and growls at her all the time.    You need to be sure that you are keeping the pack hierarchy in check. The new pup must be fed, pet, played with, etc, last. He is the lowest member of the pack and must be treated as such. You need to be in charge and hold order so there is not a dominance issue.|`|iZ7iwKR9aa	I doubt it.

18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	You can shave the tummy area but be careful not to give clipper burn,  that is a sensitive area.  Do not shave the scrotum! ! ! !   Scissor around there if you really have to but that area doesn't get wet with peeing.    Most don't need to be shaved cause they have a way of not getting it on them.  If the fur gets darker & darker then he is peeing on his coat.  Just scissor the dark hair.|`|rSqSxIyOaa	Hairy dogs don't have much hair down by their privaits.  I have a border collie and you need to brush them daily.  Otherwise it can get knoted up down by the tail because that is where collies have the most hair.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	Samoyeds are beautiful, sweet dogs.  Their fur is work, though.  You have to brush them a lot to make sure they don't get knots.  But dogs usually do it so they don't pee on themselves.  Sometimes there is some hair growing around that area, but you can clip it.|`|M3jRtq2Aaa	The groomer will shave the underside and the back legs and rear where the urine and feces tend to stick.

FnSskhcQaa	It depends on the future plans for the land.  If someone owns land around there, they may be planning a development at some point.  Or the local government may be planning for community growth.    Unfortunately, a lot of farm land is being edged out by development.  I'm very concerned about a cattle farm that has been around longer than the city it's in.  The recently sold the adjacent land to developers who are putting in $500,000 houses.  I wondering how long it will take for someone to complain about the cattle and have it end up in a big legal battle.|`|AA11633699	Maybe that is Gov, owned lands and they use them for agrigulture, or they are not turning it into anything right now and letting the lands rest,or it maybe, that the land isnt fertil enough for consumption of animals, there could be all kinds of reasons, Let me explain, if I can, Some farmers let their lands rest from chemicals and ammonia, which are toxins in the land and the water systems, so the best logical reasons is to let the grounds rest to recover their natural bounty, Its and old way of letting the soil recover from to much abuse. Then when the time is right, they will continue the farming but without the use of chemicals.|`|8aLwA4Z9aa	because they are annoying and don't understand!
P1mi6pUYaa	Dogs bite each other on the face a lot when they are playing.  And your pug might be barking at Sophie to get her to play with him.  Even big dogs know how to play without hurting little ones.  Just give them time to get used to each other.  Don't be concerned if they have to work it out between themselves by biting each others ears, face, etc.  Also, please be careful about how much you leave Sophie outside.  Your dogs will get along better if they spend time together.  And lots of dogs die of heatstroke, etc. from being left outside too much.|`|AA11603761	Did you introduce them first before bringing the other dog home?  That should have been done.  Try reintroducing them in a neutral area.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	There's really not enough information here to really know for sure if there's a problem.  Percy's barking problem should be dealt with as a behavior issue (that's another topic), but basically both dogs are establishing pack order.  Was Sophie's bite a "play bite," a gentle bite to establish dominance over Percy or a real attempt to hurt him?  Dogs of difference sizes will play bite and though it may look like they might hurt each other, they really don't (you should see my dogs play with each other - you'd think they were going to kill each other but no one ever gets hurt - if you watch the body language, it's all play).    Supervise them together and look for signs of real aggression.  If there is a problem, Sophie may not be a good match to be in the same household with Percy.  But if it's play, even rough play, Percy will tell Sophie when she's gone too far.      Also, no dog should be a mostly outside dog.  They should be inside with the family, which they consider their pack, and should especially sleep inside at night.|`|czYGbOttaa	get them away from each other!      good luck!|`|ds3BMvK4aa	well this is normal because percy is the dominate the one in ur house...so she will try to protect it by yappering,,but if this continues contact ur humane society were u adopted the lab...|`|vIGqV8QUaa	one is probably jealous of the other for some reason.if they dont get along, just let them be. when dogs bite each other, they are just playing.so relax and treat them equally|`|YMQmaIxBaa	Just sternly say no and give her a little slap on her back but not to hard.|`|g1khdn93aa	Ask the on what to do about them I have two ferrets and I asked the vet on what to do and he helped.

AA12240035	Yes, take her to a vet.  The mucous could be an indication of other problems such as an Upper Respiratory Infection.  This may be the cause of her not digesting her mouse, or she may have an internal blockage.  Either way, she obviously has problems and should see a vet.    I would recommend a herp specific vet that you can find at this website: http://www.arav.org/USMembers.htm    If you can't find a herp specific vet in your area, ask your vet about their qualifications in treating snakes.    Good luck!|`|819QdAioaa	Take her to a vet. She could have an upper respiratory infection. If she is not digesting the mouse in a normal way this is certainly a cuase for alarm adn she needs to be tended to.|`|YBDns041aa	Your snake could have impaction.  Especially if it has been a few weeks.   A vet is in order for sure.  One thing to note is to make sure you keep your snake warm.  Heat has a lot to do with the digestion process.  Good luck!|`|kBiOM1bQaa	my friend has a snake and it takes a while to digest too so im not really sure if thats a problem. about the liquid it threw up, it could be just some vomit. of course im not a doctor im just talking about my experiences with my friend's snake, but if you are that worried of course see a vet|`|a9d45f5065566439f9ed3b00f035d43faa	vet or more heat
67eb1e4855fbbd1c5305adc6026dce4faa	It sounds like your snake is going thru a mild version of hibernation/brumation. They become inactive & uninterested in food. Their body feels a bit mushy rather than firm because they are letting all the food in their system digest & pass so nothing will rot in their stomach or intestines during this inactive period. Just make sure there is fresh water available at all times & wait for her to become active & start feeding again. It could be a few weeks to a few months, you just have to be patient.|`|fFocO5vvaa	Can you call your vet and ask them to give you advice over the phone? They will probably want you to bring her in. I would.  It sounds like your little one is very sick. Lethargy and rapid weight loss are usually signs of something very serious. Good luck. I hope she feels better soon|`|Iys5pGB1aa	go to any other vet the main thing is to figure out whats wrong right and try to make her comftoable so she feels better|`|YBDns041aa	Contacting a vet is vital.  Inactivity could be due to temperature change.  When a snake burrows it is either too hot or too cold.  Have you changed the heating in the tank or in your house recently?  Try to keep the snake's tank at a good warm temperature ( 80-85 degrees) in the day.  It can drop a few degrees at night.  Make to let it be able to cool off when needed, under something that it will fit under comfortably.  If you already are doing all this and nothing has changed in it's surroundings, a vet is the only way.|`|819QdAioaa	Yes take her to a vet. Extreme changes in behavior in snakes is not good.|`|XW58So5faa	definetly seek a vet. are you sure there have been no changes? temperature? humidity? even photo period could have set it off. feeding behaviors changed? have as much info as possible. also visit www.kingsnake.com and they have alot of support there and alot of people familiar with herp health
CBmLrkCbaa	Whatever you read is bunk.  You should handle them every day EXCEPT just after feeding - wait 24-36 hours after it ate to avoid stressing it and causing it to throw up.  But if you have been doing it all along, i would guess it is used to even that by now.|`|IPkV4Cugaa	thats wrong you want to handle them a lot so they get used to you and friendly. but dont handle them after they eat.|`|67eb1e4855fbbd1c5305adc6026dce4faa	You should handle your snake as soon as is possible to get them used to being touched without getting defensive. Really young snakes can be really nippy, but will get over this only by being handled. Many snakes I've captured in the wild were really nasty about being handled, but learned to calm down quickly with regular contact.|`|wQsVXk1Vaa	no you should handle it every day so it can get used to being around someone|`|b9GpqYXZaa	Handling the snake from day one is good. Let others hold it also so it will be use to all people. The more it is held the more relaxed it will be. You shouldn't hold it if you have fed it within the past day or so because this can be stressful for the snake and can make it throw-up it's food.|`|819QdAioaa	Don't hesitate to handle the snake. They are much better if you handle them everyday for a little while except right before shed when they "blue" & after they have fed.

Todos animais na epoca da pari??o procuram se aninhar para oferecer mais conforto aos seus filhos (calor e prote??o), alem de comodidade e facilicade para a amamenta??o no caso dos mamiferos.

No caso de mamiferos isso tambem ocorre,  eles se aninham para ter a sua cria.

N?o se esque?a que voce tem que fornecer uma boa alimenta??o a ela para que de leite suficiente para os filhotes, mas nada de exageros, se for cirada com ra??o acrescente, folhas verdes, verduras  frutas e legumes, mas nada de exageros.

FnSskhcQaa	I would say take him to the vet.  Aspirin is safe to give, but I'm unsure of the dosage, so I wouldn't give it until a vet tells you how much.    The pain could be caused by something as simple as a pulled muscle or something as complex as hip dysplasia.  My last dog had a type of arthritis called spondylosis.  This is where a bony bridge grows between vertebrae because of an inherent weakness.    As for taking him to the vet, as long as he is eating, drinking and going potty okay, it can wait until regular business hours.  Should he start behaving weirdly or stop drinking/eating or pottying, get him to a vet IMMEDIATELY.|`|TRcLJq66aa	Take him to the vets,and DO NOT GIVE HIM AN ASPRIN,your friend is nuts.|`|p6f4FROdaa	Don't give him anything on medication.The best is you go for a x-ray.Then they can check his colon and his hips.|`|iYqqfFTxaa	I have a dog that sounds similiar to your dog.

qMVWYIyUaa	Is he doing it all the time or just after he's exercised or out in the heat?    Panting is one of only two ways that dogs let out excess heat, so it seems likely. If he's doing it all the time though and even when the air conditioner is on, take him to the vet.|`|SSaURdPMaa	it is because the hot weather makes it sweat more and dogs sweat off their tongues.|`|U0Na2o4qaa	Yeah, it's gotta be because of the hot weather. Dogs can't sweat (last time I checked) so panting cools them down, nothing to be concerned about.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	It's probably the hot weather.  Give her lots of water.
g72cnpQ8aa	That's odd.  You should contact the vet and ask them.  There may be a reason that your cat specifically can't eat or drink. I have 4 cats and all of them are fixed.  The all ate and drank when I brought them home, only a few hours after the surgery.|`|2pvW4M8Aaa	I would call the vet to double check.  When we had our cat neutered we were instructed to not feed him or give him water after 10 p.m. the day before the surgery.  We had no such restrictions when he came home.|`|63be34ac5695e5eb8003b4e6e9eaec4caa	If the vet said don;t do it till the time he said ;[don;t] as it could make him throw up and that would break the stitches so  call them so you'll know the exact time to give him water and food..They won;t mind you calling as it;s better to be safe than sorry,,,, good luck he;ll be fine in a few days ; and needs lots of rest in a dark quite place like a bedroom if possible....|`|0874a669a08c1d79d874acebac5177bbaa	what??????????????? that;s insane... give the CAT WATER!!  the cat will die soon without it.  that's INSANE.|`|zl66LPupaa	Because he wouldnt be good to give them food or water right after they had surgery. Normally they arent aloud to eat or drink before surgery so they wont barf and die on the table.|`|HERzDa1Qaa	usually the vet will recommend that your pet lick ice cubes at first, and to not feed them for a few hours. The anesthesia can cause them to vomit if they eat too soon.  I would call the vet to make sure.|`|MSo1Yyw8aa	You should call the vet and double check the instructions.  Usually after they get home, they should have food and water available.|`|96mAQD9Vaa	Water is fine, usually you shouldn't feed them for a few hours after an anaesthetic because they can feel a bit sick. Offer a small amount of food for now and a full meal tommorrow but you should give water now. Hope the kittys not too sore!!|`|qLc2p2jvaa	I would definitely recommend calling the vet.    I have had my cats both spayed and neutered.  The only recommendations they had, especially for the spay, was to feed them either cottage cheese or vanilla yogurt for the next 8 hours or so.    They were definitely allowed to drink water.    I know they don't want them eating too much food because of the anesthesia.    Call the vet, get the right instructions and you should be fine.    Thumbs up to you for the spay/neuter!    Good Luck!
51eecbc9425ae5db63743426d4560e5eaa	Look up"" homemade dog food recipes"" on the web sights.|`|iHwRxpGVaa	www.rawmeatybones.com  www.rawfed.com/myths  www.rawlearning.com    I feed my dog raw prey model style.  Each dog gets 2-3% of their body weight in food... So at 2%, my 55 lb. girl should get 1-1/4 lbs of food a day, but since she is more active/high metabolism- she gets about 1 1/2 lbs. a day.    For prey model, you feed 80% meat, 10% edible bone, and 10% organ meat (with no more than 5% of that being liver)...    I know, sounds complicated, but really it isn't.    Ex.  Today, I got a 4 lb. chicken out, and cut it into pieces... 3 to be exact.  One of my dogs got the neck, tail, and some of the breast meat cut off- 8oz. worth (1/2 lb), one got half of what was left, and the other got the other half... (so each got 1 1/2 lbs.)  I split up the organs that were in side, so each got some.    That was it.  Don't have to feed them again today, and I know exactly what they are getting fed.  They get the same chicken from the store that I can buy and cook for myself.  They are the healthiest dogs I know.  No allergies, no itching, great skin/coats, no dog odor, white teeth, no bad breath, etc.    Good luck.|`|c9fefd1015efa94f3f3f18a5ed127859aa	I feed my dogs chicken and rice. I boil the chicken, debone it and cook the rice in the chicken broth, adding water as it cooks out. It is kind of pasty when its done, but it is gentle on the dogs digestion, and it is good for them. I keep it in the refridgerator, and warm it slightly before feeding them. They love me for it.  :-)|`|P1mi6pUYaa	I make my dog plain boiled chicken breast with plain white rice.  Then I get mixed veggies from the freezer section and boil them.  I mash them up and mix them in the chicken and rice.  The dog loves it.  I also make him biscuits with flax meal and I give him an omega-3 tablet for dogs every day.  I know, I know....I'm a freak :)|`|aqEMiZMyaa	Here's what Cornell said awhile back: A leader dog in the wild eats first....He eats the stomach of the prey first...it contains carbs in the form of grass (this is why dogs try to eat grass)...next they eat fat....they get the most energy and stored goodies from it...lastly they eat red meat which is protien....which also gets them energy, but no where near that of fat....The amount of fat needed is related to activity levels...if you need endurance...more fat....if not...more protein....but carbs are also needed.....So we feed noodles with oil on them combined with cheap steak cuts (limited amounts) served with dry food for bulk...Hope this helps|`|48VvcTYcaa	I make something different every week. I use a different meat, vegetable, and carb every week, and some extras.    For meat, I use chicken (breast or meat boiled off the bone), ground beef, or liver (rarely), stuff like that.  For vegetables I go heavy on the green leafy like spinach, broccoli, green beans, but also use frozen mix packages and vary it up quite a bit (but no onions).  For carbs, I use either brown rice, long cooking oatmeal, or potatoes.    I brown the meat, then add chicken or beef broth (or buillon and water) and veggies and carbs. Then usually pressed garlic, occasionally a few eggs, and cook for a while.    That's it. When I serve it I sometimes add cottage cheese, nonfat yogurt, other veggies, anything I can think of. I'm going to get some fish oil and doggie vitamins too.    And hey Gracy - all 4 of my dogs have lost weight on my home cooking (and loved doing it!). Some time ask your vet just exactly how many nutrition classes they took in vet school.|`|XyYA993gaa	noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!...  dont  give your dog homemade food.Becouse the homemade food make your dog to get  more weight and then your dog can have dispesia thatis a sickeness on the legs|`|Eqd3F4x9aa	grilled steak

As long as you are their with him you can try putting him in his crate and walk away, if he is quiet then you should reward him for his actions. I hope this will help you but remember it will take some time so you might have to get use to it for a month or so.|`|cf9d7a4fc1fb2659abd7a7ad86d605ceaa	Oh another one that didn't do their homework and plan ahead.  What did you think was going to happen?  You went out and got a PUPPY, not a mature dog.  Your lifestyle is such that you are gone for hours and hours.  And you have a roommate to consider!  A puppy is a BABY dog and cannot be left alone like that.  No wonder he barks!    You have a German Shepherd puppy.  I hope to heaven you are not in an apartment.  If you are, you must be out of your mind.  Have you any idea how big they get?    The problem is not the dog, it's the person!|`|P1mi6pUYaa	He might have separation anxiety.  You can try to cure it by putting him in the crate, then going out the door and returning immediately, gradually lengthening the time you're gone.  And don't make a big deal when you leave or come home.  Or you could get the vet to prescribe you some anti anxiety medication so he'll calm down.
ldfE9vNGaa	If the TV is the only new thing, or change in your indoor environment it could well be the problem. Some dogs are more sensitive to change than others, they prefer things to stay the same and are stressed by new situations etc.    Give her time to adjust to the new TV, keep the volume lower than normal for a while and try not to make a big fuss of her is she acts afraid. Just be matter-of-fact and ignore it if you can. try to keep her routine the same and pretty soon she'll realize that the TV is not 'dangerous' or a threat in any way.    However, if she doesn't settle down within a few days or shows any other signs of stress you may want to talk with your veterinarian to rule out any other causes for her behavior.    Good luck!|`|FIqB1xcVaa	Some breeds of dogs are more attuned to changes in their environment than others. I have heard of dogs barking at a trashcan that was suspicious to them just because it was moved to a different spot in the yard.     The TV is probably the object of suspicion to your dog. Lead him into the house and tell him to "sit" or "lie down" by the TV. Make sure he stays there. When he obeys you, give him lots of praise and treats. Soon he will learn that being next to the foreign object is a good thing, and not something to be scared of.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	Try turning off the TV and bringing her inside.  See how she does.  Maybe the picture or loud noise is scaring her.  Get her on a leash and walk her around the house and see if there's anything in particular she's avoiding.

cd731a89d8c493e5a2e82406e38dcdb2aa	Well, she doesn't provide much info about her Border  Terriers, just 'shots/wormed, health guarantee, shipping'. I see no info regarding health testing on the parents, type of health guarantee or how long of a guarantee. A one year health guarantee is worthless..... MOST hereditary issues (if there are any) aren't going to show up until aftter puppyhood (2 yrs or better, and sometime not until they are 5 of better).    The only thing I can tell from what she has, you need to contact her and ask her for health testing info and what type of guarantee. If when the dog is 6 yrs old and your circumstances change and you can't keep the dog, will she take the dog back?    Not providing much info to begin with, I'd be a little leary, and very cautious.|`|yyP7f8mnaa	Here are some suggested questions one can use to determine if a breeder is truly responsible:    1. Is she an AKC registered breeder of good standing and an active member of her breed Parent Club?    2. Are there AKC Champions listed on the pedigree, showing that the breeder spends her time & money to prove the quality of her breeding stock through competition?    3. Are all the animals kept in clean, comfortable, healthy, loving circumstances?    4. Did the breeder conduct extensive interviews with you and every member of your family?    5. Have the sire & dam received all available health clearances, (eg. OFA Hip & Eye, Thyroid testing, THESE VARY FOR EACH BREED)    6. Is she willing to honestly discuss any possible genetic defects that may exist in her line?    7. Does she have a Sales Contract?    8. Does the contract contain a clause stipulating that you spay or neuter the puppy before it reaches a certain  age?    9. Does the contract contain a clause stating that if at any time in the puppy's life, you can no longer care for it, it must be returned to the breeder? (This ensures that no animal bred by this breeder will ever end up in a shelter).    10. Will the breeder maintain contact with you for the life of the puppy to answer questions and help in general?|`|P1mi6pUYaa	You should go to the Kennel and see how it looks.  Are the animals treated well?  Or are they put outside in cages and not taken care of?  Do the people treat the dogs like part of their family?  How many litters do they produce a year?      See how much other breeders are charging for similar puppies.  Then you'll know if they're charging too much.|`|2ihVxNL0aa	I couldn't find anything on the kennel online. Your best bet is to go to the kennel and see how it looks to you. Trust your instincts. If something seems fishy... it probably is. If your having trouble finding a puppy in your area you could always try puppyfind.com and do a local search. There's puppies of almost every breed in your state I'm sure. They also offer a neat feature of testimonials from new owners. Its kinda like the feedback option on eBay LOL. Then you can also see how much puppies of that breed are going for from other breeders. Good luck with your search and have fun with your new puppy when you get one!!!|`|QT7nsNGLaa	You never said what breed.   I found one for Jack Russel's    No website, very few details.   But I do worry when they say all colors, all coats, parents on premises.    Many top breeders do not keep breeding the same dogs to each other.  So they may have stud dogs on premises, but not always the ones used to sire the litter.    I'd say ask a lot of questions.   Look up the national and local club for the breed.   Check their websites.   Find out the health issues in the breed, make sure they test for those.    So if you tell us a country and breed, it might help narrow it down.    If they breed more than 1 breed, buyer beware.    This is what I found: http://classifieds2.breedersclub.net/ind...    This breeder has puppies available now, also not a good sign.   Good breeders usually have a waiting list and extensive interview process.    Unless you want to show, I'd say adopt a dog and avoid the pitfalls of buying from a breeder that has hype but no substance.   Learn to read between the lines.|`|af2cc80c2f661b39d5f017474e7d9922aa	Those who breed purebred dogs should have some stake in their breed. Responsible breeders are concerned with the betterment of the breed. For example, they work on breeding healthier dogs with the appropriate temperament for their breed. They show their dogs in breed or performance events. These endeavors help them to learn more about their breed. They are members of the national breed club for their breed and subscribe to a code of ethics.   A sample code of ethics may include the following:  ? Puppies for sale are born on the premises, not shipped in.   ? Breeder does not sell puppies to wholesalers, brokers, dealers or retail shops.  ? Dog set up is clean and well kept.  ? Breeder insists that the puppies for sale will be at least eight weeks old before being placed.   ? Sire and dam of the litter are at least two years old and were tested for genetic health before the breeding.  ? Breeder volunteered information on the health testing of most of the immediate relatives of the sire and dam, volunteered proof and offers a guarantee against genetic health problems of at least two years. (Note: It isn't possible to produce dogs entirely free of genetic problems.)  ? Puppies for sale and dogs for sale have been introduced to children and other animals as part of their socialization.  ? Breeder reviewed some of the problems some people have with the breed.  ? Breeder sells pet puppies on a spay or neuter contract.   ? Breeder is available as a resource for advice and support for the life of the dog.   ? Breeder promises to take the dog in (not return your money) if you can't keep it, for the life of the dog.  ? Breeder provides a contract for your review and goes over it with you.   ? Breeder raises no more than 1 or 2 different breeds of puppies and dogs for sale. It is very difficult for a breeder to be competent in more breeds.  ? Breeder is a member of a breed club.  ? Breeder's primary concern is finding a good home for the puppy, rather than getting paid.  ? Breeder asked you lots of questions about your lifestyle, family, experience with dogs and other pets, why you are looking for a dog for sale.   ? Breeder was happy to answer all your questions and made you feel comfortable asking for advice.  Responsible breeders provide   ? a written, three-generation pedigree.   ? health record including a diet,   ? inoculation and parasite control record, and health guarantee.   ? basic diet and care information.  ? time frame during which the puppy or dog may be examined by a licensed veterinarian, at the buyer's expense, and, upon written recommendation of the veterinarian for specific reasons, the puppy or dog may be returned to the seller for a full refund of all money paid, Breeder are well educated and dedicated to their breed.     Before breeding, prospective parents should be healthy, have a stable temperament, be strong and well built, and typify their breed. Responsible breeders carefully research their dogs lineage in order to find the perfect mate. They spend long hours, at first educating themselves, and then, educating prospective buyers about their breed.
QT7nsNGLaa	They are a Working Breed.   I consider them a large breed because as you say they tend to be under 100 lbs...good thing as many giant breeds die young or have health issues.    Train your Schnauzer now to have it's feet and ears handled and start brushing it as a puppy.    I've had to deal with some aggressive Giant Schnauzers that were not well trained for grooming and had gotten thrown out of shops because if being nasty.    They are great dogs with the right owner that trains them.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	Giant breeds are usually bigger than 100 lbs.

I hope this helps and try to train your dog instead of making the rest of its life miserable.|`|M1at6KE9aa	Is your dog neutered?  If not, that may be why he is so aggressive.  This is often a problem with this breed.  Neutering him may mellow him out and solve your problem so you won't have to get rid of him.  Keep in mind that it takes about six weeks for the male hormones to leave the dog's body once it has been neutered.      If the dog has already been neutered and is still aggressive, try contacting some of the local rescue groups.  They will foster him and try to correct the issues at hand and find him a suitable home.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	It sounds like your dog has some serious aggression problems.  You can hire a dog behaviorist to help you deal with his aggressiveness.  There is a chance you might get to keep your dog, but you would have to work hard to get him to change.  He needs a professional who can work one on one with him.  It would be really hard to get him adopted if he went to a rescue or the pound.  Ask your vet to recommend a good trainer who can help you.|`|8wtzHcQJaa	Why don't you take it to training school. Pets stores like Petsmart offer classes to train your dog.  You should also stop spoiling him.  My dog is also spoiled but I don't let him go far enough to bite or scratch people.  You should punish him when he does something wrong.  I don't think he knows that he is being bad.|`|BhxTTXjRaa	If you can, try an obediance class. Or, ask around and see if family or friends could try working with your dog. He needs to be worked with someone who's not showing fear who will modify his behaviour in an assertive way. Spoiling him with food will encourage his biting behaviour.  If he bites someone bad enough, he will be euthanized. He needs to be trained to stop biting ASAP.    How much excersise is he getting? Not enough excersize, or being inside constantly, can bring out very poor behaviours. In my experience with huskies, the more workout they get, the better. They also were much happier with as much time outdoors as possible. At the shelter I work at, we had a husky who'd go bananas indoors. He'd pace, push people around, snap and destroy his kennel. We got a dog house and he stayed outside the entire time (during the winter) he was at the shelter (after closing, we'd move the house in to the garage and lock the garage to protect him).    If you end up having to get rid of him, take him to a no-kill shelter or see if a friend would take him.    There's still hope. Ask people at the shelter you volunteer at about training classes in your area, or even if there's someone there who can try working with your dog. Do a little internet research about huskies and see if you can maybe find something that will help you (ie: certain behaviours, things you might subconciously be doing, etc). Good luck and don't give up!|`|Hk4ICXrcaa	Have you tried taking him to a trainer? Since you got him so young that could probably be the reason why he's so aggressive. I hate when people give dogs away, they are family members in my opinion, I would never give my dog away but sometimes there are extreme circumstances like yours which forces us to think about it. I would try my hardest to fix his problem before giving him away, I would take him to classes and while in training process I would keep him outside most of the times away from the little ones he could harm. Huskies are beautiful btw
XnXbPYd5aa	How did you realize she had kittens?  Did you see them or hear them, or was it that you noticed that her teats were full?    If you haven't seen the kittens, just noticed that she is full of milk or has long teats because she has been nursing, it is possible that she is not returning to her kittens because they are dead.    Lots of things can happen to kittens born outside to a homeless cat.    All sorts of predators such as foxes, coyotes, raccoons (all of which live in and around our cities, to say nothing of the countryside), dogs,  hawks, owls are attracted to nests of helpless young animals, and the mother cat would not be able to defend her litter.   The kittens could also have died from flea infestation -- fleas drink blood and it doesn't take many fleas to cause fatal anemia in tiny kittens.    They might have died because the mother cat was too underfed and dehydrated to produce enough milk for them.    If the kittens were alive, she would go back to them.   Mothering instinct is extremely strong -- a few years ago a mother cat returned over and over to a burning buiklding to rescue her kittensd one by one even though she was so badly burned that she lost her ears and eyesight.       I would continue to feed the cat and give her plenty of nourishing food such as kiten food (she needs the extra calcium and vitamins) and water, and when you can, take her to the vet if you plan to keep her.  She will undoubtedly need flea treatment and deworming, probably ear mite treatment, and above all, she needs to be spayed.   If you don't plan to keep her, take her to an animal shelter where she can be cared for and, hopefully adopted.|`|356aee609aa08102078a2960b94765e9aa	mmm tough question.  I'd say to look around for the kittens and to stop feeding it (but if it is starving then I guess feed it).

G2eh62yHaa	What he's doing outside is marking his territory.  Pretty much letting other dogs know he's been there.  He should not do this in the house, but may if he feels threatened.  If you catch him doing it inside, make a sharp noise, or whatever you normally do to tell him its not ok to do that (spraying with a water bottle, saying NO, etc.).  He should stick to your training inside the house, though.  If he's not neutered, you should neuter him as soon as you can and it will greatly increase your chances of him only doing this outside.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	Hopefully he'll still pee on the pad, but if he gets a notion to mark his territory, he might lift his leg to mark something.  If he's not doing this now, I wouldn't worry.  Most dogs don't do this, but if he does, you'll have to train him not to, which can be hard.  But he won't do it cause he forgot.|`|kFxpqWGGaa	No acctuallly when dogs get older they start to mark their own terretory he hasnt forgotten his training to pee on the pad .But he will keep on marking his own terretory.But will pee on the pad.|`|M3jRtq2Aaa	If you don't neuter them before they start to mark, it becomes a problem.  You can use either a belly band (wonderful product) or else simply start crate training and taking the boy outside often. After they do start marking, neutering no longer has the value it did before they matured.|`|VS5qCFsbaa	he didnt forget his training he is marking his territory
P1mi6pUYaa	It's dangerous to leave him outside.  In general, it's not good for dogs.  All kinds of messed up stuff can happen to him.  But especially at the 4th of July.  This is when the most dogs are put in the pound out of any other day of the year, because many of them freak out when they hear fireworks and break through fences and windows (no, I'm not kidding) and run like crazy to get away from the sound.  Take your dog in until the fireworks are over.  He's scared and he needs you.|`|6NJwkq7baa	let him in! he is your dog ,, !|`|AA10047634	Yes, it's very normal. Please let him in. If you have some sort of tranquilizer, you might feed him some of that, too. It's just one day per year, have pity on him!|`|O0jUUkTCaa	well my dog is scared of the vacuum cleaner and always will be, probably. just let him in until it is over
AA12206156	Oh dear.  Along with grapes and raisins, which all dogs seem to love, cherry leaves, stems, and pits are also toxic.  I know because we have 3 greyhounds, all of them very happy to chomp on pits if we decided to have a "pit spit" contest, so we have to choose our targets very carefully indeed.    I would imagine that one cherry pit wouldn't be an issue, but continuing to consume them definitely would.  Watch your dog for any unusual signs of illness:  vomiting, diarrhea, heavy panting, decrease in vigor, and act accordingly.    If the pit was consumed whole, there's not likely an issue; as other posters have said, it'll likely pass through without being digested.  If, however, you hound chomps like our hounds, be careful.      The site below lists many items that are toxic to dogs.  Have a look, then scout your yard.     luvfastdogz|`|0xJZJggVaa	You'll see it again tomorrow.|`|b84334dc4c69c929f51e2aaa4f84ec25aa	SHE WILL POOP IT OUT|`|02cc5f522ae200429924999d4cbfeeadaa	Oh the power of a good Sh*t.

My puppy, so far, has eaten, and pooped out, 2 of my scrunchies, and a sock.  Very dangerous I know.  I never thought a dog would actually eat a sock.  If he starts acting funny though, go ahead and print out directions to your nearest emergency vet, but a word of warning...be very prepared to pay.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	She'll probably throw it up or pass it.  Just watch her over the next few days to see if she seems to be feeling okay.  If you suspect anything is wrong, or she's having trouble passing it and doesn't throw it up, take her to the vet.|`|d8043f9c983ac001a490a18c9fc2a60aaa	nothing .. do not fret.. he will pass it tomorrow :)|`|PxfP0RGJaa	He'll be ok.

PpQNFq9baa	If he's a puppy and young this is normal.  I remember one of our cats actually lost one of her teeth like a child would, and I remember the vet saying it was normal.  For the dog, I'd make sure she was comfortable and give her lots of water, and give her soft food.|`|a61dba48a983fa5c3d20f3d5a3f752deaa	How old is the dog? if it is a pup this may be the natural process of losing the baby or milk teeth. If the dog is older and it is the adult teeth you are speaking of, you need to take the dog to a vet immediately.|`|APyZP1Txaa	well first of all its natrual to take it to the vet when this happens to older dogs but puppies sometimes loose teeth but if you think it hurts him take him to the vet and see what they can do|`|P1mi6pUYaa	This is normal.  Just leave it there and let your dog take care of it.  Don't pull on it, because it's obviously still attached.  Most of the time, you don't notice dog's baby teeth falling out because they swallow the old ones and the new ones grow in really fast- sometimes the next day they sprout up.  It might bleed some, just like when kids lose their teeth, but mostly it's not painful.  Remember when you lost your teeth?  It didn't really hurt.  Same thing for him.

Scraps! My Grandmother fed her cats and dogs on bread and milk and other scraps,and whatever the cats could catch,and her animals lived to be very old,and were  healthy,with nice coats.I remember feeding bread and milk to pups when I was a kid,and they turned out fine.People worry too much about what their dogs eat these days.And,you know your table scraps didn't come from China!     Just wanted to add that someone mentioned sugar free gum.The ingredient is Xylitol.Look for it in gum,mints,etc.Keep these away from your dog,as only a small amount can be deadly.Macadamia nuts are bad,too.|`|AA10288031	Table food isn't too bad for dogs, as long as it isn't every single meal, and as long as it isn't something with a lot of fat.

Oh... and NO CHOCOLATE... unless of course it's carob.  That kind of chocolate dogs CAN have. They make cookies out of it.  Stick to a dry food that has decent levels of protein and carbs... not supermarket brands.  Try Merrick, Innova/Evo, California Natural, Canidae.  No fillers and increases life expectancy.

But you could get some useful information from a store like that.
DEn2DcmUaa	I crate/kennel trained my German Shepard, Sassy, as a puppy. The secret is to keep the puppy in the crate or under your watchful eye at all times. Once the puppy has gone a month or so going only outside he/she will begin to get the idea. I recommend this be done under the supervision of a dog trainer. Most cities have puppy classes available. It is way too easy to leave the dog in the kennel too often, or too long, out of convenience if you aren't careful or don't know how to do it properly. Puppy training classes run about $100-$150 in most cities and are worth every penny. There are also some very good websites. I've list a few to get you started.   http://www.inch.com/~dogs/cratetraining....  http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/our_pe...  http://www.cuhumane.org/topics/crate.htm...|`|8accb9ae01507e9d4e1ed55a7caec396aa	A puppy is like a baby. He will relieve himself anywhere, anytime. Because a newly adopted adult dog is unfamiliar with your home, he may not understand where he should "go"! Housetraining, or teaching your dog to go outside to relieve himself, is an important lesson your dog must learn.   It is up to you, the new parent, to housetrain your new puppy or dog with patience, love and understanding.   CRATE TRAINING  In the wild, wolves live in a den or cave. It is important the entire wolf pack keep this area clean. The same idea works with your family pet. Your dogs crate is his home, his bedroom. It is likely that your dog will not like to soil his bed. Therefore, he will wait until he is let out to do his business.   HOUSETRAINING WITH YOUR CRATE  On average, puppies can hold their bladders one hour for every month they have been alive, plus one hour. For example, if you have a three month old puppy, he can wait 3 + 1 = 4 hours. If you work longer than this, the best solution is to have someone (a neighbour, a relative, a dog walker) come in at an appropriate time to let your dog out.    100 PER CENT SUPERVISION  Supervision is the key to housetraining! While you are at home, your dog must be supervised. Whether you are watching television, making dinner, on the phone or on the computer, your puppy must be watched. While it sounds like an impossible task, it isnt. Keeping the crate in a social part of the house makes it easier. Using a house lead  a small, thin lead with a little clip on it  also helps immensely. Outside, you put a lead on your dog so you can control him. If the lead is removed after returning home, control is lost. For example, when watching television, have the lead tied to a couch leg. Your dog can have his blanket and toys with him. Hell feel safe and comfortable. The majority of accidents happen when your pup wanders off and you havent noticed. You dont want him to sneak off into the kitchen and find a puddle a short time later. If your pup is kept from wandering, the possibility of an accident is diminished because he will not eliminate where he is sitting. 100 per cent supervision means ensuring your dog is playing with you, in his crate, outside or on his house lead.    SCHEDULING  In the morning, take your dog outside. He should urinate and possibly have a bowel movement. Spend about five to seven minutes with him and then bring him in. Do not play with him yet. Feed him breakfast, either in the crate or with the lead, and supervise it. If your pup did not have a bowel movement earlier, take him back outside about 15 minutes after he has eaten. Use the lead to keep your pup moving along while outside. Otherwise, he may start sniffing, stopping and playing to avoid the job at hand. You can say hurry up and your dog will begin to associate these words with the task at hand. Praise him excessively when he has eliminated. Bring him back in the house and place him in his crate if you are going to work. Continue to supervise him with the crate or the lead if you are home. When returning after being out, go directly to the crate, let him out, praise him and put him back in. Feed him his meal, take him outside 15 minutes after he has eaten, praise him after he eliminates, and bring him back in. Continue to follow the same steps consistently.    While you are home, you should take your pup outside on a regular basis. Even if your pup is in a crate or on a house lead, he still needs the opportunity to eliminate. Also, be careful what you wish for! A pup who barks to go outside may be cute and clever now. However, you must try not to fall into the habit of leaping up every time your dog wants in or out. It is a very submissive gesture on your part. Have your pup wait a moment or two.     Setting up a schedule is also a good idea. If your pup is under four months of age, take him out for five minutes every hour on the hour. If your pup is over four months old, take him out every second hour on the hour. The schedule will help you remember when to take him out. Go out for five minutes only. It provides the opportunity to eliminate even if your pup may not need to go. Take your dog out after active play and also after napping. If an accident occurs, you may have forgotten to take him out .    FEEDING TIME   Having a puppy drink a lot of water and then placing him in his crate is much more unkind than letting him be a bit thirsty for an hour or two. Adult dogs should have access to drinking water at all times. However, this is not the case for untrained pups. Most parents will not allow their children to drink a big glass of water before going to bed. Avoid setting your pup up for failure. Restrict his water intake to three or four drinks daily and make sure you remove the water dish about three hours before bedtime. This will help your dog sleep more comfortably.    If it is a hot evening, supply your pup with a few ice cubes. They will enter your dogs system at a slower pace. When feeding your pup, provide a high-quality food that is a good source of protein. The food must be concentrated so your puppys body doesnt require much of it. If you feed less, your puppy eliminates less. Food is directly related to how well puppies do in their housetraining.    EXERCISE  It is important that your pup gets a lot of exercise, especially while crate training. You can play fetch, chase or hide and seek in your home. You can call come at the same time to provide further training. Anyway you do it, your pup needs to be able to run and play.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	To get the smell out, use Oxi-Clean mixed with water or Nature's Miracle (get it at a pet supply store).    For the crate training part, you have to make sure the crate is small for his size.  You don't want him to poop on one side and sleep on the other.  Dogs won't go where they sleep.  So put him in the crate when you're away or at night.  When you take him out, take him outside and let him go on the grass.  Then praise him and give him lots of treats for being good.  He'll get the idea soon.|`|miki4Jn1aa	its really good you are crate training-- it will help your dog in the long run    i would recommend first cleaning the spot in the carpet where the dog typically uses with a vinegar solution as to get out the stain and dogs HATE the smell of vinegar and will not go there again    second-- block off part of the crate so that your pup has only enough room to turn around and lay-- dogs do not like to poo where they sleep--     leave your dog in there any time you are not at the house and when you get home in order to avoid excitement peeing-- wait about ten minutes before you show them any attention and do not make a big deal out of it when you leave-- this can lead to anxiety issues..     good luck-- any more questions brookie8513@hotmail.com|`|4Xkt1lGAaa	I had the same problem with my chihuahua puppy.  They can smell the scent of the urine even after it is clean.  It is best to buy stain/scent remover at a pet store for that.  Are you training your puppy to go outside or inside?  If the puppy is very young they usually have to go out almost every hour and usually 20 minutes after they have eaten or had a drink.  If you are using a crate they will usually try to hold it for as long as they can because they don't want to mess up their sleeping/den area.  Small dogs can take longer to train then bigger ones you just have to be persistent with them. Good luck.

LOL|`|c773e75fa03db9335d6257f9c16e42acaa	I don't know if that's necessarily true; having natural darwinism instincts, a dog will do whatever it needs to do to live, so I don't know if helping a dog learn would help it's teachings.  A dog learns regardless of being taught to, every animal/mammal/fish/etc. does naturally.  So without teaching, it will act as if it's in the wild, and naturally become very defensive and unfriendly.  So, I don't truly believe in that.  In my opinion, you can only make them learn by training them.  Then again, I may be misconstrewing the question.|`|SpzRykp1aa	Sounds right to me!

Humans can do this, too, but it's not our primary way of learning.  For dogs, it is, so it is very effective to keep this in mind and use positive reinforcement to help a dog learn.  I don't believe in punishing dogs, though.  I think it's not near as useful as other methods.|`|AA10367504	That makes sense to me

23e57bd1ca8f35a8604d6b4cd0dee4c7aa	I train service dogs for college. If you have a petco or petsmart in your area most of them do training, but they encourage you to be there during the training so you know how to continue the correct behaviors in your home. Depending on what type of training you want, basic training is around 20 dollars a session and can be up to 60 or 70. But if your on a budget just pay for one session, go with you dogs and pay close attention. Then after class ask LOTS of questions so you can finish training the dog yourself. Beagles are very smart, they catch on quick. It won't take long.|`|hlI2hgk4aa	try 600 dollars and up per week|`|P1mi6pUYaa	Beagles are hard to train sometimes, because they're so stubborn.

Group classes vs. one-on-one training vs. trainers that actually take your dog for a period of time and train it themselves all play a role in the trainer's fees.

That doesn't mean you can't have a trainer helping you (thats what we are for) but at the end of the day if you hand the dog over to someone else to be trained you won't be happy and the dog will most likely not be trained.    I would recommend puppy or beginner classes which run anywhere from free (local humane society) to 50 (pet stores) 100 (average local trainer) and 80-150 an hour to train privately. I charge on a sliding scale starting at 95 dollars an hour and many other trainer do to. When I ran group classes puppy courses were 100 dollars for 12 sessions with 8 dogs in the class with two instructors.    Since you have a beagle (and I believe this is your first dog) I would recommend working with a trainer and be prepared to do your homework between classes.|`|7UtStVUPaa	It's usually worth the money if you can find a good person to do it. It helps to start group classes at PetSmart to begin with. Those are very well priced.    Private training gets very expensive.|`|aIgTm2E1aa	You should always be the one to train your dog.  A good dog training is there to coach YOU.  Find a training class that meets once a week for about an hour.  The average price in my neck of the woods breaks down to about $10 a session.  So if you sign up for an 8 week class, expect to pay around $80.  I would NEVER recommend sending your dog away to a trainer where you cannot be a part of the training process.  There are too many wack jobs in the animal world that are not opposed to hitting/kicking/or worse.|`|b8e1755da720b51020434b3175ed1c82aa	Look all you need to teach your dog upto the dog been 7 months old is how to sit.  At 7 - 9  months of age you can teach the dog to stop, stay, lie down etc.    It took my Akita one night of training for him to get it right everytime.  You cannot be serious about paying for a professional.  You  are wasting your money.  It takes no time at all to bond with your dog through training.    A few nights no more than three will give it all the basic commands required.

Good luck to you and the kitty.|`|AA10568677	Yes it actually works..I used to leave my cat in the bathroom isolated at night and she usd to do her business in the litter box...I did this for 2 weeks and She was used to it already..try it and see what happens..also if you see her trying to do poo and pee somewhere besides the litter box like on the floor..you keep picking her up and place her in the litter box...keep placing her in it until she does her business in the litter box..make sure you watch her a couple of times so you can see what attracts or distracts from the litter box..dont reward her for pissing on the floor...she'll recognize what she is doing is wrong.. If you need more help e-mail me or Im me at dominibearhot727 =]..I know alot about animals so if you need help ask me!!|`|MSo1Yyw8aa	I have a cat with behavioral litter box issues.  I put her in the bathroom with a litter box and food for a few days, until she was always using the litter box.  Then I just let her out and she was fine (I left the litter box in the bathroom after that).    Every once in awhile she'll have a relapse and then I'll shut her in the bathroom (usually overnight, but until she's used the litterbox again) again.  Usually that's enough for her to figure out the situation, because she really hates being shut in the bathroom alone.

d2550681958ae523a223de537ae17476aa	I would seperate them if possible, and crate train the one with most of the problems. Just get a crate, or a carrier, and every time you leave the area, or leave the house, put the dog in the crate with its own toys, and it will learn not to use the restroom until you let it out. Dogs will not use the restroom in their own living space, if it is big enough for them to sleep in, but not too big. As soon as you get home, take the dog out of the cage, and take it outside to use the bahtroom. The beagle feels threatened by the boxer, being that he is younger. Try to let them play together. I have a 6 month old female rottweiler, and a three year old male boxer, and they get along great. Our boxer is the dominant one, because he was here first. He lets the other know he's the boss, but he also plays with her toys and she shares. It depends on their temperament too. Some dogs pee all over the house to show their owners that they hate being ignored. Our same male boxer did that to us whenever we'd leave the house even for a few minutes, and this was before we got our rott. Training all animals takes a lot of patience on the owner's part, and it takes time. Just find a way to play with both at the same time with one toy, and let them decide. Just don't let them fight aggressively. Good Luck!|`|CcEis9Kyaa	he i just marking territory also i would think of getting the beagle some new toys|`|Zyx6Lfhmaa	Beagles are know to get their feelings hurt easily and are good at holding grudges.My beagle has been mad at me for about 7 months now and started peeing at night in a spot that she KNOWS we will step in first thing in the morning.She was being closed out of the bed room at night.I gave her a bed in my bedroom and she sleeps in it and stopped peeing.By the way,she's 8 and WELL house broken.She had NO HEALTH ISSUES to back up the peeing as a medical issue,I worked for the vet I used.He is most likely peeved that there is a new dog in the pack.Give him time,let him sleep with you at night and close the door to your room so he's not tempted to go and pee.Keep the new dog out so the beagle feels "special".Best of luck.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	He may be marking or with the toys, he may be submitting somehow to the other dog.  At night, crate the beagle for a few months.  As soon as you get up, take him outside right away and praise him/ give him treats for going outside.  Dogs won't pee where they have to sleep.      He may be urinating submissively, too.  Usually dogs grow out of this, and I've heard you shouldn't make a big fuss when he does it.|`|mPigRXDbaa	well my aunt has the same prob. what she does is flick him in the nose it DOES NOT HURT HIM all it does is tell him whos boss.|`|IgffhjB9aa	hes probably marking his territory|`|yZwz4QJ5aa	it is because he is upset, try hard to keep him happy. If this doesn't work go see your vet.
WnjxtqZ6aa	Rabbits do mourn the loss of their mate.  It takes time for them to mourn and patience on your part will help him through his loss.    Just to be on the safe side, I would take him to the vet to have him thoroughly checked over to make sure that he isn't sick.      If he's not eating, it's important that you help him until he feels like eating himself, the vet would be the best person to show you how and inform you of what needs to be done in order to keep your bunny on track.    When's he's not so sad and back on track with his food, I would take him to the nearest rescue or shelter (making an appointment for a bunny date) and find him a new mate of his choice.  This makes bonding a lot easier because he gets to pick who he likes and not who you like.|`|TQcl8Ktyaa	Well, it depends what the other rabbit died from.  Did they have any symptoms like sneezing or any discharge?  What are you feeding them?  How old are they?  There are a lot of variables.  You may need to take the live one to the vet.|`|8phMfVERaa	VET NOW!!!!  It's acting out of character, it is direly in need of attention.  This is not due to sadness, it is due to illness!!!!!|`|aWyKglIOaa	well, i think you should take your rabbit to the vet and tell your vet this problem. i guess it could have caught something, but if not maybe you should consider getting another rabbit so it won't be as lonley.|`|JhbaASauaa	umm it might be because of sadness.. also did your rabbits live in outside cages or hutches? if that  then it will explain your rabbits death.. you gave us crappy details add more and i can help then..|`|31d579d473e6fae5a0f9bbccdacd59a2aa	Please take this animal to the vet.

h0JnXhNWaa	petfinder.com, ADOPT.|`|AA11853631	Check the shelters. Put your name on a list there so they know you are looking. Ask for the number of the chihuahua rescue in your are. Just so you know, there is no such thing as a teacup chihuahua. 5 lb is a standard size, 8 lb would be larger than the standard but is still a small dog. Good luck.|`|M1at6KE9aa	You need to learn more about the Chihuahua breed before buying one.  There is no such thing as a teacup Chihuahua.  That is a marketing ploy to rip people off.  If you contact the Chihuahua Club of America or one of the Texas Chihuahua clubs, they can give you referrals to some breeders in your area.  Just remember that buying any dog is "caveat emptor."  Let the buyer beware.  Anyone claiming teacup, tinies, toys, or "rare" is nothing but a rip-off artist waiting to take your money!|`|AA10036321	there is no such thing as a teacup Chihuahua. some Chihuahua's are born smaller than others.  and based on the parents of the dog does not guarantee size.  i own two Chihuahua's; one weighs 5 lbs and the other 10lbs.  the dog that weighs 10lbs was suppose to be smaller than the 5lbs.  This is what the breeder told me because his mom and dad weighed so little.  But I have researched on the net about the teacup size and found it to be a myth.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	http://search.petfinder.com/search/searc...    Check this out- it's all the female Chihuahuas on petfinder.com in Austin.  There are some really cute ones there, and most of them are 5-8 lbs, like you want.  These are all rescued Chihuahuas who have been saved from being put to sleep.  Getting one of these pups instead of from a breeder will save you lots of money and save your dog's life.  Good luck!|`|l8H5U4GHaa	I just got a Min-Pin/ teacup chihuahua mix about a year ago. I found him in the paper. I usedAustin American Statesman classifeds online. They even have pictures in lots of their ads. He weighed 4 pounds when I got him and now he weighs 8 lbs. He has not gained any weight in the past few months so I think he's done growing. I would also suggest craigslist.
AA11515691	Around where I live people do call in and complain about the dogs disturbing the peace.   I have a hound dog and he constantly barks. He barked before so long that he lost his voice. It didn't matter if I waked him or not he just wanted to go hunting and he sure did tell me about it.|`|Tcm4FUAEaa	my dog used to do the same but we put her to sleep in november. she would bark because she heard something or because she had to go to the bathroom. ask your vet whats wrong        happy to help = )|`|P1mi6pUYaa	They can call the police and you can get tickets for making noise during early morning and late night hours in most places.  You should consider making him an inside dog, it would help.|`|AA12363322	People can call the police for noise disturbances.   I suggest trying a bark collar.  I got one of the those as a last resort for my dog outside and it only took a day for her to figure it out.   Now she doesnt need it.    But this is after I tired everything else, like trying to teach her the word quiet.  My other dogs learned she didnt.
BisUpJX3aa	I would recommend you wait.. what are you going to do with the dog when you move out?  Its not easy to find a place that will let you have a dog when you are starting out.|`|lLtQmzDlaa	cry a little & buy febreeze every week|`|74612366d3f5858710eb2beb14fbb493aa	i got my dog by just asking and asking so try that and keep it up and soon when they think you are ready they will get you one|`|4AeDtspLaa	here is what you do.  i have noticed that around town, especially a Wal-mart, on a Saturday there is sometimes someone selling or giving away some of the cutest little puppies.  keep your eyes open and when you see this, make sure your parents go with you (just to look).  then pick one up (make sure it is the cutest one) and tell them that the dog needs a good home. (and try to get your eyes to water a little).|`|RHhkct43aa	Tell them you will sign a contract. That did it for my dad. lol.  Huskies don't stink, but they shed. Labradoodles (at least the one I know) stinks, but doesn't shed. But I know there is a breed of dog out there somewhere that doesn't do either. Ask them what their problems with getting a dog are, then give them logical and clear answers that they can't say no to. If you can't think of an answer at that exact moment, don't answer, and tell them the answer when you do think of one. If you can't think of an answer for a question they ask, email me. I have experience with that. lol. (the same thing happened to me and I just kept asking them and finally my mom gave in [she wanted a dog but she said to wait a year after our dog died, and I did but she was still not sure] and we went to the pound and found a dog there and my dad saw him and totally fell in love.)  Go to the pound and find a puppy of that breed, wait and be patient, and s/he will come, then show your parents and they will fall in love. All puppies are cute!!!  Also, if they say yes and you are looking for a dog, get some books and maybe even a video of how to train them, housebreaking, sit, stay, come, etc, and they will so impressed and stuff, they will think you're mature if you act it. (haha).  Good luck and PLEASE don't buy a dog from a breeder. They are more expensive, more likely to have health problems, and (on average) live for a shorter time than mutts. They are also very very unique.|`|fc336d5424c16f3e9612fc15f19bdd7faa	Well, I ran into this same problem, although my parents finally gave in. I basically explained to them that I was ready for a great responsibility so that I could better myself as a person. Although a dog is a huge responsibilty and alot of time will have to go into it, from potty training, playing, feeding, and just caring, as long as you have the time and effort needed to give to this dog then you'll be fine. What I did was make out a scheduale of what time the dog would get fed, and when I'd take him outside for a potty break, and show them how I could work around school and other activities I had and still have time for the dog, try something like that to show them your really serious, I even wrote my parents a letter explaining how badly I wanted this dog, and make them a deal, like if you can't care for it then you may need to find it a better home like if it wouldn't work out. And I decided to pay for all the puppy supplies if they got me the dog, and you've gotta make sure you make it clear that you will do all you can to clean up after the dog if it makes a mess, give it a bath regularly, depending on your dogs size the smell may not be a problem, just stay away from schnuazers dogs like them have ear problems which smell pretty bad, just show them you are responsible and capapble of handling this.  Best of luck to you.|`|gK0jjANQaa	Get a bishon poo. My sister got one and it doesn't smell, is very smart and cute.    Oh and don't gimme all that bs about taking care of it all the time. My sister GUARANTEED she would take the puppy out EVERY day yet everyone BUT her takes her out. Very smart :) When my sister pisses the dog off she pees on her bed haha|`|z2rwzJWVaa	I would say give it time, maybe you should dog sit for someone that way your parents will see that you are able to take care of a dog without their house smelling. It will prove toy them that you are responsable enough to have your own dog. Good luck!|`|zxtEb9mOaa	dogs dont smell. tell your parents that you will wash your dog and take care of it and pay for everything.       see im having the same problemn with a chinchilla.     a method is buying a collor and food dish and all the supplies then saying, now all we need is a dog!|`|xtNMm0rYaa	Sometimes you can't always get what you want. I am a sucker - if i see animals at the rspca etc i want to get it, but to me animals are for life - even if the dog/cat was really naughty i still wouldn't give it up. I feel so sorry for all those unwanted animals out there that just want some fun and love in their lives but their dumb owners didn't fully understand the responsibilites of owning a pet.    If you know they you will be a responsible dog owner then i suggest a small dog such as a maltese because they don't shed and also inside dogs don't smell - as long as they are washed once a week. My 2 dogs are both inside and they never smell - i wash then once or twice in a fortnight.  You will also have to toilet train you puppy so be expected to clean up nasty messes all day and night.  Anyway good luck.
97036da6f1d4b340bf2d09b0c3db3e3daa	I believe that all dogs are in heat for about 21 days or three weeks.  If you do not want any puppies, I would watch her very carefully when she is outside.  Watch her VERY carefully around day 10 to 14.  During this time period if she mates with a male she is pretty much guaranteed to get pregnant.  Don't get me wrong, a female in heat can get pregnant during any time of the heat but those four days is when she is at her peak.|`|6pzCNM5Caa	I've heard of dogs breeding on day 22.. so I generally am careful to just past then.|`|wOBxFW1taa	2-3 weeks it would be best to talk to your vet about it|`|onGiq3Aaaa	i am not tottaly sure your vet will be able to tellb ut i thinks its 21 days (3 wks)|`|P1mi6pUYaa	2-3 weeks on average.

When you rescue instead of buy, you are saving you puppy's life :)|`|53a72154af1d1bfa7cae469a2dd9a500aa	They are pretty good with kids. This type of dog is just a little short on energy. It may not be a good match for that reason.     A dog with a good disposition with children would be a choc. Lab or a Boxer. I myself have a schnauzer, he is more into adults and other dogs.|`|9ab264c1b22ecf7e7fb80a5555272515aa	English Bulldogs raised in a loving home are excellent companions to children.  We have 2 in our home, a male and a female, as well as a cat, and 2 young children.  Though my husband and I have both always been dog lovers and have experienced many different breeds/mutts, Bulldogs have become our favorites.  They are so easy-going.  Day-to-day maintenance is a little more than what another breed would require as far as keeping their face wrinkles clean, but as long as you start this when they're young, they'll accept it as part of the daily routine.  They don't require a lot of exercise.  They are content to lounge in front of the TV.  They have more personality than any other breed I've seen, and are just silly.  In our experience, I have found much of the information available online to be exagerated and made to sound like much more work than what it really is.  Perhaps it seems that way because we did start the maintenance (bathing, nail clipping, wrinkle cleaning) at the puppy stage, so it isn't something we have to struggle through.   I do love all dogs, but I honestly don't see us ever having anything but Bulldogs from now on.|`|wazwHteUaa	no|`|97LWGGxeaa	google them - http://www.bulldoginformation.com/  or http://www.bulldoginformation.com/temper...|`|z5j2gLzaaa	English bulldogs are great with kids.

BRQQgg9Laa	First of all, you shouldn't have a pet if you don't have enough money to take her to the vet. It's not fair to her. If she has rabies her mouth will foam and some other stuff. JUST TAKE HER TO THE VET! You are not being fair to this poor dog. You should give her up for adoption if you don't have the money. Take her to the vet, you will be out of money, but you will have saved her life. Put her up for adoption. I'm sorry, but you are not fair to her.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	Rabies won't show up for awhile, sometimes as long as a few weeks or more.  Did you get your dog her shots?  If so, she is probably fine.  But if not, you should take her to the vet as soon as possible.  I don't know if they can do anything for dogs for rabies, but you should find out.|`|UjEB5GYNaa	You can have a rabies antidote administered, I think.  Why not just CALL your vet and ask them what they think?    Here's a link which describes the early stages of rabies.  If your dog displays any of these symptoms, suck it up and go to the vet.      http://www.animalhealthchannel.com/rabie...|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Sorry to say, if your dog has rabies..

Rabies doesn't run rampant in every wild animal. I've seen stray dogs in my town hunt for mice in the deep grass in the fields. None of them has ever got rabies, and they also haven't had shots.|`|6101021cc624ac7e4bf3f970d72d3628aa	There is no sure way to tell if your dog has rabies, unless you got ahold of the animal that bit her and they test that animal, and i will not go into detail how they do that. I'm sure though if your pet starts showing signs, of avoiding eating, being lethargic, and not its normal self, but get her in as soon as you can. I haven't really heard of a major rabies outbreak anywhere so i hope all goes well for you and your dog...|`|O3i1fY3baa	was she up to date on her vaccinations?  that should help keep her safe, but unfortunately, once the symptoms are apparent, it is usually too late   just watch her and keep your fingers crossed|`|wWDAWmBdaa	Has your dog been vaccinated against rabies? If so she is safe. If not you need to find the money somehow to get her tested. If the rat or whatever was rabid waiting so long would be too late for your dog.

Just praying she has had the shot.|`|YAQjlzKDaa	To know if the animal had rabies, you would have to catch it and freeze it and then take it to the vet so that they can check the frozen animal for rabies. but if you didn't catch it, then take your dog to the vet to have it checked.|`|77Q4we3Xaa	You need to take it to the vet.

Just Don't Get A pet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|AA11039147	If this is the first visit try calling around and see who has a first puppy check up.  Some vets do the first visit free and then the rest you have to pay, but call everyone one in your area.|`|LhJc7Doqaa	He'll need distemper/parvo/hepatitus, rabies, heartworm test w/ preventatives & flea control. It'll probably run about $100.00 to $150.00. A small price to pay to be sure he's healthy & protected. And he'll need to be neutered but that can wait a little while. Please get his shots done as soon as possible. Parvo & distemper are fast killers & he's been living on borrowed time as it is.|`|9gqKtzFaaa	we get shots at the feed stores and do them our selfs all but the rabie much cheaper about 5 bucks versus 150 for them|`|P1mi6pUYaa	It depends on where you live.  The biggest cost is usually the office visit, which is about $50 in my area (DC).  The shots themselves aren't really that expensive.  The 3-4 that you need are usually under $40-50 for all of them.  It's worth it though.  You should also ask the vet for a prescription for heartworm preventative while you're there, even if you can't buy it that day.|`|qeGZNOlEaa	At our clinic, puppy visits usually are about $90-$120 depending on if they have worms, what kind of worms, heartworm prevention, if owners buy Frontline, etc. And we generally do four visits if we start seeing them at 8 weeks. If he's already 8 months, your vet MIGHT not think he needs 4 visits(part of the thing when they're younger is that sometimes the immunity from the mom can interfere with the effectiveness of vaccines). At our clinic, I'd guess you'd be looking at the lower end of that, since as a Maltese, he won't be needing the larger sizes of heartworm prevention and flea prevention. Plus he's old enough to be neutered- this cost varies HUGELY, and depends. There are low cost spay neuter places, and different vets charge different amounts. I know the clinic I work for is the most expensive one around here for surgeries, but that's because bloodwork and pain medication are included in the cost of the surgery (can you believe pain meds are optional some places?! OUCH!)   Anyway, if you were coming where I work, I'd guess you'd be looking at like, $360-$400 grand total for all his shots/fecals to check for parasites/deworming probably at least once, and probably $110 to get him neutered. Depending on where you live, and what veterinarian you take him to,that number could be higher or lower.|`|tDj74YbDaa	Call the local county animal shelter in your county or town and ask them where you can go to get free or reduced shots for your dog. They will be able to tell you what vet is offering a shot clinic that month. You should be able to get your dog caught up on all shots for approximately $20.00    Thanks for asking.
P1mi6pUYaa	He's marking his territory.  It helps if you get him neutered.  You can use Nature's Miracle to clean the chair leg.  There is some stuff you can get that will make the dog want to pee only in a certain area of the yard.  I'd do that, but when he comes in the house and tries to pee on the chair leg, you're going to have to be very stern and consistent in telling him no.  You have to treat it like potty training and be adamant that he not pee inside.  You could try putting some pennies in  a can and shaking it near him when he tries to pee inside.  It will scare him and most dogs don't like it.|`|FhdyUQwGaa	neuter the dog.    spray the chair leg with a mixture of white vinegar and water     try a belly band. That's basically a band that cvers your dog's privates when you don't want him to pee...you can find them on ebay.|`|6BaHD8Yzaa	no, i dont think your dog is having trouble emptying its bladder; my guess is that your dog is trying to mark his territory. you could try putting him on leash and restricting the area he has available. i know that most petstores sell stuff to make the grass green again and also to remove the scent, so then your dog won't be able to smell the urine. if the problem persists, it may be wise to take him to the vet.     i know my dog used to do that as a puppy, but stopped as he grew older. Hope this helps!
lVVejVhLaa	A true albino has no pigment,all  the skin will be pink, the hair will be absolutely white and the irises or the eyes will be pink or blue and pupils will be red instead of black.|`|AA10511925	A true albino will be entirely white with pink to very light blue eye color.  They usually have many genetic problems such as eye (blindness) & ear (deafness) as well as others that may not be obvious right away.  They need special protection from the sun since they have no pigment and are susceptible to sunburn and skin cancer.  The albino gene is recessive, so in order to have an albino pup, both parents must be carriers, which means the breeder is either uneducated or doesn't care that she is intentionally creating pups with problems.  If this dog has any cream on it it is not an albino, it is just a white w/cream, which may or may not have 1 or both eyes blue.|`|xd2PDu18aa	It's not really albino if it doesn't have pink eyes (usually).  Albino is a lack of pigmentation. Creme color is created by pigmentation. Result: Conflict. It can't have color and be albino.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	It might be cream color there because it got a little dirty.  But to be an albino, it will lack pigment totally, including in his eyes.  They'll be pink, I believe.

Have a look at the below websites for full information|`|FhdyUQwGaa	well, the right solution to tear stains is that they're caused by bacteria, and to get rid of them you need to go to the vet and get a low dose of an antibiotic. There's a powder called tylan that does a great job. Please don't mess with the dog's PH or rub crap on it's face!|`|Q9eO9kAtaa	Petco and petsmart have stuff you rub there to get rid of it.

Tear stains are related to ph levels, and ACV helps balance ph in the body.  There was a question asked about this recently, but I can't seem to find it now.  Another reason ACV is a good idea is that attacks the problem at the source instead of just covering it up on the surface.     Another preventative is to rub a small amount of Desitin (yes, diaper cream) on the tear stains.  It allows the tears to run off instead of staining the fur.  Also, the tear-stained area around a dog's eyes can become irritated, and the desitin helps soothe the skin.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	There are tear stain wipes at the pet store, and they work pretty well.|`|Ao0OtVj0aa	There are alot of natural remedies, topical treatments, and other solutions to Maltese eye stain that use no chemicals and are all natural. They are painless and work good on sensitive areas. Certain types of topical vinegar and herbal eye washes work great. This site has alot of suggestions: http://www.maltesemaniac.com/maltese-eye...|`|rCPDmgvOaa	Well, getting the stuff from a store that has pet shampoo is a really good idea. Something else you can try if your puppy isn't too excited about having soapy stuff around their eyes is getting a nice and warm wet rag and rub in the direction of the fur. Not only does it help get the stains off, it's also very refreshing for the dog. Good Luck!|`|rQT1PBs2aa	try doing these things....  - make a habit of daily (preferably in the mornings) wiping her eyes with a damp cotton ball  - once or twice a week put 2 drops of visine in each of her eyes.  - also twice or three times a week put mineral oil in each of her eyes!    good luck!
P1mi6pUYaa	That sounds really weird.  I would take her to the vet, because I've never heard of that before.  She might be having a bad problem with her eye; I've never heard of brown gunk coming out before.|`|wX3RzHaRaa	Take her to the vet, this is not normal and could be serious.|`|7LcrQHBMaa	She mostlikely has an infection in her eye.  You will need to go to the vet and get eye drops, she should be okay for a couple of days.|`|yLK5NWzaaa	yeah i would get your dog checked out by the vet,...i hope shes ok :)|`|53dba8548aeeeb2ef05ae37390e4f371aa	it might be process of cherry eyes i suggest u take her to the vet
P1mi6pUYaa	If they are sensitive to fleas, they might keep on for a few weeks.  If so, you should take them to the vet.  But otherwise it should go away within a few days.
MAZBBJp4aa	Were fireworks going on near by where you live on July the 4th? That could be the reason why she doesn't want to go outside. She was probably traumatized and is afraid that she may hear the loud noises again.|`|qKD9uFp2aa	It may be that she's developed an allergy to grass. I had a beagle with the same problem. He didn't mind the walks because they're on concrete.|`|IxKbA67Jaa	Here's my suggestion, eveytime she goes outside, once she comes back in give her a treat. do that EVERYTIME. in alittle while shell realize oing outside is good. WEll it worked 4 me|`|cwb5evBaaa	It  probably didn't like July 4th.  Dogs assosiate pain and scaredness with place.|`|AA10794514	Since the onset of this fear was the fourth of July I'm guessing the loud fireworks had something to do with the fear of the outdoors. Get a tape of thunderstorms and play it on low in the house. Gradually increase the volume when the dog tolerates the noise. Play with the dog or distract it from negative reactions with treats and attention. Praise the dog for going outside and offer a treat as well. Small pieces of turkey go a long way in convincing a skiddish dog that the outside is the place to be. When you have more time at night after work, you can make sure his outdoor time is pleasant by playing games, etc|`|P1mi6pUYaa	My beagle is scared of fireworks, too.  It sounds like yours is really scared, though.  Bring some little treats in your pocket when you take her out.  While you're out, keep giving her treats.  This helps her associate going outside with good things.|`|d8e3c6db7c51cf03a72ff07c3f9ef052aa	maybe since the booms of the fireworks it does not like going outside or because of all the people it gets scared.
a2a4ff53294099cbd968949b90d0807caa	Considering that its still itchy it might be fleas or it is allergic to the cat poop|`|P1mi6pUYaa	I bet it is the cat poop.  He's eating it, and it is made of cat food.  So it's totally ruining all your effort in having him on a special diet.  Try moving the cat box to where only the cats can get to it.|`|lZX6k8Dyaa	cat poop if eaten can become dangerous do not allow your dog to eat it if have to put the cat litter box somewhere high where cats can get but dogs cant.  chris|`|WvO5sl1saa	I went through something similar with my dog - we ended up sending her blood work off for allergy test and she is actually allergic to cats! She has several other things she's allergic to as well - we now have her on allergy shots and she's doing great.    You may want to consider the allergy tests as your next step.  Good luck!
nvPHccPbaa	You know your dog's history, and I applaud you for making sure that this would be healthy for all dogs and people.    It's really impossible to answer this question without seeing how your dog acts. I'd get an animal behaviorist to help you out. He can evaluate if getting another dog would be a good idea depending on how your dog acts.    Do you ever take your dog on walks or to the dog park? That would probably be a pretty good indication of how she is with other dogs.    If you think you'll need to keep your dogs separated, maybe that says that it's really not a good idea. But since you've done it before, you know how feasible it is.    When she attacked your other dog, did she injure the other dog? If not, that's an indication that she knows how to curb her protective drive or jealousy or whatever might cause her to bite. If she had a good opportunity to really hurt your other dog and didn't, I would think getting another dog could work. If she drew blood or really hurt your other dog, I don't think it's such a good idea.    Many dogs who don't really like other dogs are much more lenient towards puppies. If she gets to know the other dog as a puppy she might be willing to accept her. Depends on the dog.    It might also be a good idea to select a shy/submissive puppy. Your girl seems to be quite dominant and I'd imagine she'd want to fight with a dog that challenged her position. Also, females generally get along better with males (and vice versa).|`|LhJc7Doqaa	How does the bulldog act around other dogs like during a walk or at the park? If she's not aggressive, I'd give it a try. Otherwise, given she has already attacked another dog in the home, you'll have to really be cautious & sure that you can keep the new dog safe. I added a new puppy when mine was 7 years old & didn't have problems. Since then, I've always had at least 2. But, this is something you need to decide & be sure if it doesn't work, you can return or rehome the new addition. Good luck & I hope it works for you.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	It might be a bad idea.  Try taking your dog to meet the new puppy first.  See how she reacts to other dogs in general, especially puppies.  If she does okay, let her spend time with the puppy supervised.
P1mi6pUYaa	He's trying to play with you when you bark at him.  You can tell he likes it because he wags his tail and tries to lick you.  It definitely isn't hurting him; it's good for you to spend time playing with your dog.      My sister's cocker spaniel is like this.  He's just very vocal.  It's how they communicate, so it's only natural that they hear something and they want to tell you all about it.|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	I'm not sure but I think it is rather cute!  My cocker spaniel has the most adorable bark/howl too!|`|yMOoc6PIaa	normally its because it hurts their ears. but other times that's just how they play, and it boosts their adrenaline
bUtl3fDkaa	I recommend having:  - a tug toy  - a squeaker toy  - a cuddle toy  - a chew toy  - a kong ( http://www.kongcompany.com/ )|`|P1mi6pUYaa	I think you have enough.  Every once in awhile, buy him a new toy, just to keep him interested.  But he can't play with them all at once, so if he likes the ones he has, don't worry about getting tons of toys.|`|BRQQgg9Laa	I think you're good for now. Wait until he tears them all up, then get some more.|`|QyXj7NUmaa	I think kongs are great too.|`|807dT1jOaa	I have owned 3 labs and when they are pups they chew on everything! get a Baby Kong and stick it in the freezer, then fill it with peanut butter when it's good and cold to cut back on chewing while teething. the more toys they have to keep them busy the better|`|2NpjxKwTaa	Maybe a softer toy with a squeaker for that comfort factor but otherwise you're good!|`|iqiYYin4aa	For a Lab, you'll probably need ALOT more.  They are notorious chewers and you don't want them to turn to chewing something thier not supposed to.  I would get something from Orka, which makes chew products or Nylabones are good options.  It's also ok if small parts of those are ingested.

Make sure u take him out to "go" as soon as u r awake, before u leave, as soon as u get hm & so on. Train him 2 go on command (sounds harsh- but its not), praise him when he does go on command- like a game. If he's left in the house, cover floor with newspapers, and confine to 1 room (perferbably room w. no carpet).  Take a puppy training class at PetSmart- or whatever local chain pet store near u.  A puppy/dog is totally a blessing but tons of work.  All they want is to make u happy.
AA11039147	I would take him to see a vet and see if there is any medication or treatment that could help your dog.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	What's causing the abrasions?  Is he biting himself?

342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	I've had 2 dogs who are afraid of thunder and believe me, desensitizing them does not work like it might for other fears.  They can't control this one - the theory is its because of change in atmospheric pressure.  Sight hounds and herding dogs are most susceptible and I've had 1 sight hound and 1 herding dog with this fear.    I don't like using the vet prescribed tranqs either - because of the side affects, but the dog needs help.  What I use is Bach's Flower Essences, Rescue Remedy.  It has no side affects, takes about 20 minutes to work and is enough to calm the dog.  My grey can just lay on the couch with me and not shake himself to pieces.  He's 70 pounds and gets 4 drops, a sheltie would likely only need 2.    You can get it from holistic vets, health stores and some drug stores.      The other thing that's helped my dogs is to be in a room with no windows or if they can squeeze themselves behind something (like a big chair).  Being in a confined space seems to be comforting.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	If she's 7 and has had this problem for a long time, she probably won't get over it.  You could try helping her associate the storm with good things, like treats, but she might be too upset to notice them.  I'd suggest getting a mild tranquilizer from your vet for storms so she can calm down a little.
86d3fa5e8ea3caa23a01700c8f24522daa	I've seen them  - but  *never*  bred them.      Why would any * * sane, dog-loving person * *  do this ????      If the person is thinking about doing this, it tells the rest of the "dog world"  the person has no clue to the number of dogs and cats killed/euthanized each day.    Now, this is of the understanding that the person is irresponsible.   If the breeder of these mutts is a RESPONSIBLE person, they will meet breeder standards........... and I might think differently upon them.    If this mutt breeder can get a contract on each puppy as to spay and neuter and a $100 deposit from each buyer before the  mother is bred......   I  "might"  think differently.         This is from the ASPCA  but you will find similar standards on any breed club of America or rescue group:    http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pag...    For some reasons, people who call themselves responsible breeders don't like these  statements in particular,  Esp. the last statement of taking the puppy back !      If the breeder  were responsible, there is NO hesitation in getting their puppy back and it SURE would PREVENT  KILLING and EUTHANASIA of those breeder's pups !!!!  : : : :    Taken from a section of the list on  ASCPA:   - Screens potential guardians; discusses positive and negative aspects of animal/breed.    - Ensures animals are weaned (eight to ten weeks of age for dogs and cats) before placement.    - Offers guidance and support to new guardians.    - Provides an adoption/purchase contract in plain English that spells out breeders responsibilities, adopters responsibilities, health guarantees and return policy.    - Provides accurate and reliable health, vaccination and pedigree information.    - Makes sure pet-quality animals are sold on a limited registration (dogs only), spay/neuter contract, or are altered before placement.    - Will take back any animal of their breeding, at any time and for any reason.      Inconsistencies in the mutt factor:   The puppies from the cross were not consistent in looks or coloration because of the uncontrolled genes.    Some were wavey coats, some were curly.   There was more white to the markings.    No one knew if the dog would be trying to herd or trying to hunt !    No purebred dog rescue wanted them because they are mutts.    The unsold pups were dumped in the shelter by the owner.   The shelter would euthansize them in 3 days  since it was an 'owner turn-in."    So they called and placed the pups in an all breed rescue.    It  STILL took almost 2 months to get all 4 puppies placed.     I hope no one is thinking this is a good idea.    If you want such a cross, I'd go to PetFinder.com|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Only backyard breeders and puppymills... It's a mixed breed dog, it's not a recognized breed..

Besides if you teach a dog to be mean it most likely won't know who to be mean to and if it bites someone you'll have a bigger problem than your fear of people comming into your house.  Your fear is what you should be fixing.  To tell you the truth everyone has that fear, it's life.  But either way a dog humanely cannot be an efficient protection system.    However...  If having a dog would make you feel more secure go for it.  When I was a bit younger a rotwieller mutt adopted us.  My dad trained her and socialized her to no end.  She is the most loveable dog you will ever meet, but anyone that comes to the door is terrified of her because, well, she looks like a rotweiller.  She is the most harmless creature on the planet, it's just that she looks like the stereotypical mean dog and her way of saying hello to people is by barking in a friendly way, but people don't see it like that.|`|KnJ9qm6Waa	german sheperd ADVICE don't make it evil just make it look mean|`|P1mi6pUYaa	Actually, you don't have to train a dog like that.  You don't want to make your dog be mean, because any dog will defend you against intruders.  They understand when someone doesn't belong in the house and they are a deterrent to anyone who might want to come in.  Dogs don't have to be trained to protect you; they just do it.  You could get a dog that is bigger if it makes you feel better.  Look on petfinder.com for some dogs that you like.|`|JHRmbDXaaa	Why are you so afraid? Did something happen to you?  Do your parents leave you home alone, and if so does that make you uncomfortable?  The person who said any dog is a deterrent is right, even the sweetest dogs can have very scary-sounding barks when someone knocks on the door or gets near your house.  A nice dog will make you feel safe not only because he can scare off strangers, but also because he will keep you company and become your best friend! Petfinder.com is a great place to look, I got my dog there.  You can sort by dog age, size, sex, breed, even whether they are good with cats and/or other dogs.  Good luck!|`|b4eBUjkoaa	You don't ever, ever, ever want a dog to be trained to be mean to strangers or aggressive. What you need is a well balanced trained dog to be with you. If anyone ever attacked you believe me your dog would attack out of instinct. A large strong breed is not the answer. They take years of training the right way and it is a HUGE responsibility to own a dog that needs to be trained from the start that you are the leader. They can kill and they will kill and you will be responsible. Please watch The Dog Whisper on National Geographic channel and also email him and he will help you. If you are a fearful person it will only make your dog fearful. Dogs don't have language they pick up scents and our energy. It will feel that you are an unstable pack leader if you always have fear and you will have an unbalanced dog that you will end up giving away. I think you could ask your mom and dad to talk to you about your fears and maybe they could help in a different way. I'm a psychiatric nurse so I know this will be the best way for you. I will be so happy if this helps you.

JfBzzXQ4aa	Your dog is only 10 months old. Expect him to have lapses in his focus at this age. Until he really gets into Agility & finds out it's fun in itself, it's your job to keep it more interesting & more fun than anything else going on. Different dogs all have different "ULTIMATE motivators" . Experiment to find out what that is for your dog. For some it's a special, for training only, toy & for some it's food. If food seems to be what your dog works best for, remember to practice with him on an empty stomach. Try different kinds of food till you find something your dog would just die for. Cheese, liver, little bites of chicken, hotdogs, peanut butter, little bites of leftover meat from dinner, cheetos, etc. You might find you need to change it up too to keep him really interested. Keep your training sessions short & fun. Maybe only 10 minutes at a time. Sometimes dogs start to sniff when they are unsure or are getting stressed. If he starts to sniff, call him back into focus with you by asking him for a hand target & then praise & treat that. NEVER tell him NO when you are training. If he does something wrong, just say "Try again" in a happy voice & take him back & try again. Use lots of verbal "cheerleading" when he is learning & treat or break for play often. This will bolster his confidence. Always end the training session on a positive note. Ask him to do something he does well, praise, treat & quit. Hope some of these ideas work. Let us know how things go with your class & training. Good Luck & Have Fun!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  Agility Trainer/Competitor over 9 yrs|`|Uhasekptaa	give him attention

P1mi6pUYaa	She may well have been hurt by her previous owners, or maybe they didn't socialize her properly.  Poor girl!  I'm having similar problems with my foster dog, who is super skittish and runs from loud noises.  But over time, she is getting a little better with normal noises in our house, like soda cans opening, or refrigerator door slamming.  It's important not to coddle your dog, and act like everything is fine.  She'll take her cues from you.  If you try to comfort her like you would a person, that actually makes her worse.  Just be confident and that will help her more.  She will adapt to the baby's crying, etc.  If you haven't had a baby around before, she'll just need time to adjust to it.  But she'll get there.|`|VOfLrxcyaa	Don't hold on to what happened to the dog in the past...your only making it harder for her to get over it. Dogs have an amazing sense of what a human is feeling...she doesn't seem to trust that you can take control of the situation so, she runs from it. If you stay calm and make sure she knows that YOU are in control, and will not let anything harm her, she will learn very soon not to be so afraid. The best thing you can do for her now is to get over what happened to her. Dogs and most animals don't live in the past, they move forward much faster than humans.|`|ce262169ba489a004f002fe3a940f891aa	If nothing gets better before baby comes, talk to your vet...they do make anti anxiety pills for dogs.

Let her explore the baby when it's quiet. If it makes a noise let her run. But she will get used to this, and will probably bond very well. :)
P1mi6pUYaa	There are a lot of good brands out there, but they aren't sold at supermarkets or department stores.  Usually (in the U.S.) you find them at smaller, locally owned pet supply stores.  You could also try to purchase the food online.  Some good brands are Solid Gold, Canidae, California Natural, Innova, Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul, Paul Newman's brand or Nutro.  Good luck!|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Where do you live.. maybe you can get Canidae?? Check their website.. The store locator will tell you if it's available in your area.. Garbage foods are anything from the grocery store, plus many others, but a good list to avoid for sure is Science Diet, Iams/Eukanuba, Purina, Kibbles N Bits, Ol Roy, Pedigree, and Beneful..|`|yc3bSa9Aaa	I reccomend Hillsscience diet if you can get it.

jm0VyjqYaa	Puppies can only hold it for 2-3 hours, more than that and they'll go write then and there.  You can get a "dog litter box" if you don't mind picking up the waste when you get home from school.  The brand is called second nature and is very large pellets made of recycled paper.  Also, you can get puppy pads that dogs will go on (they obsorb).|`|2750612e5f13dce019608698b152c87eaa	Definitly not from 7-3. Depending on how old the dog is....    puppy: 3-4 hours    dog: 4-6 hours    senior: 3-6 hours  (depending on medical conditions as ages)    I take out my smaller dog every 4 hours or so. You would need to have someone care for your dog while your at school. impossible otherwise. sry!|`|d289eb4eace655e028868427c01b8266aa	They have tiny bladders so not too long. Put some pee pee pads down and teach it to pee on those while you are at school.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	When they're puppies, they can't hold it more than 2-3 hours at a time.  After a few months, when they are about 7-8 months old, they might start being able to hold it while you're at school.  You're in big trouble if you don't like being woke up.  Puppies wake you up a lot.  If you don't wake up, they'll just pee or poop in the house.      I would recommend you get a Chihuahua who is old enough to hold its waste already.  Then you won't have to get up as early- you could adopt one that is already housetrained.  Try looking on petfinder.com.  Then you'd also be saving your new dog's life!|`|eFZqX7i2aa	how long can you hold yours? try getting the dog after you are out of school or hire a dog walker if you can't be bothered to get up and walk the dog, the longer they hold it the more risk of infection or risk of going in your house and putting up with you being mad at it for not holding it til you got around to taking it out|`|AA10486121	When you are at home, it is important to take the dog out every single time it looks like it has to pee/poop. You are teaching it that going in the house is not acceptable. If you cannot do that, you will have to find someone who may be able to take the dog out at least every 2-3 hours from its kennel. If a dog goes in its kennel, it is usually an emergency for the dog - dogs do NOT like to got potty where they sleep. If all the above is not possible, I suggest keeping the dog in a more open area (like the garage if it's not too hot), and teaching the pup to go in a specific spot - like on a puppy pad. Dog walks are VERY, VERY important and you may be able to take the pup on a long walk in the morning and let it do all it's business, and then put in the kennel until you are at home at 3. Make sure to give the doggy water, food, and a toy in the kennel so it doesn't feel so locked up - and when you are home, let her roam about so she can still develop physcially and be healthy..

Tudo isso porque,  claro - eu n?o tinha tido uma eperincia legal com felinos...    At um dia que gata vira-lata adotou minha casa e come?ou a rondar pedidno comida... Eu ia dando - ra??o do meu cachorro, um peda?o de salsicha ou restinho de coisas... E a porqueirinha foi se acostumando comigo at que ela me adotou de vez... morava no forro da lavanderia - no fundo de casa... e come?ou at a arriscar de vez em quando descer pra perto do meu cachorro...    No come?o foi uma odissia - uma baita aventura: ela descia pra comer a ra??o do meu Lucky diretamente do potinho dela - uma atrevida... A ele via e saia correndo atrs...    Isso foi acontecendo tantas vezes que meu cachorro acabou se acostumando e eu acabei colocando um potinho pra ela um pouco s distante do dele - e ela vinha e comia no potinho dela...    Ela (Branca) aprendeu rpido e ainda ensinou tanto pro meu tat?lo quanto pra mim, que gato tambm  legal...    Eu passei a me aproximar de gatos e fiquei f? deles tambm... Descobri que eles tbm se adaptam e que tbm criam rituais de amizade, como os c?es...  um barato!!!     Agora onde vou acho um e tento fazer amizades... Algumas vezes n?o d certo, outras s?o aquela alegria...    Sou bab de bicos dos meus amigos. Quando viajam, eu tomo conta dos bichos deles. Um casal amigo tem cinco c?es e uma gata. Outra amiga tinha um c?o e depois uma gata acabou se infiltrando na casa e acabou ganhando espa?o junto com o c?o. Quando eles viajam eu  que vou l dar comida pros bichos.

Adoro cachorros porque eu tenho um institnto "Felcia" gosto de pegar, apertar, espremer e se o bicho tiver limpinho at mordo a pontinha da orelha...rsrsrs (fazia muito com a minha basset que hoje mora com meus pais). Tenho muitas saudades da Paquita.    Como A.M.O. animais, mas trabalho o dia todo e alguns finais de semana viajo optei ter uma gatinha por ter sua personalidade de independncia, seu nome  Juju ela  um doce chega perto de mim pedindo carinho, dorme no meu travesseiro todas as noites e comigo n?o tem essa quando ela entra em seu "mundinho" vou l acaricio, brinco, aperto ela e rapidinho interage comigo. Eu n?o posso ir ao banheiro que ela vai junto e fica arranhando a porta querendo ficar perto de mim. Se ela est no quarto comigo e eu vou pra sala ela vem atrs. As vezes chaga a encher o "saco" .... rsrsr    A nica coisa que me incomoda no comportamento da juju  que ela sobe em cima da pia da cozinha e do fog?o, e quando pego ela dou at umas palmadas com o jornal, ela fica doidinha. Mas adoro quando chego do supermercado cheia de sacolas e ela quer se meter pra ver o que tem dentro. Ela adora sacolas, enfia a cabe?a em uma das al?as e fica correndo pela casa parecendo o super-homem. Quase morro de rir! Tambm quando vou para outro ambiente da casa ela fica na quina da parede e quando passo ela d um pulo em cima de mim e me d uma mordidinha no joelho, local onde morro de ccegas e parece qua ela sabe disso.    Dou banho em juju todo sbado, as vezes a levo no Pet pra cortar as unhas a aproveito para dar um super-banho. Eu comrpei um livro sobre animais e nele informa que n?o  o plo do gato qua causa alergia e sim a sua saliva que fica quando ele resolve tomar o "seu banho".... slep ... slep.    Tenho uma amiga que tambm tem gato e ficamos horas contando as travessuas de nossos "filhos" e uma curiosidade que descobr  que o gato da Nbia, o Stite, quando ela vai lavar banheiro e usa Q-Boa o gato fica todo manhoso miando de forma extensa.... s n?o sei o que ele sente quando cheira o produto, mas  uma comdia.    Penso que o animal  o reflexo do dono, se vc d carinho ele ir ficar mansinho. As pessoas agem com pr-conceitos porque n?o conhecem.

veDvtYhJaa	So now we know you've deluded yourself into believing small dogs aren't ending up in shelters like large breeds.  You sure have made up lots of excuses to make yourself feel better about breeding your dog.  <br>  <br>  The bottom line, regarding your actual question is:  regardless of what anyone claims, WE CANNOT KNOW the answer as we are not vets, and we have no way to examine your dog and test him.  This is what needs to be done.  While he has bred before, there's always the possibility that he's not in proper condition to breed now.  <br>  <br>  The other thing is that, while you thought you had the timing right, maybe you didn't  have it timed right last time.<br>  OR<br>  Maybe the female can't breed.  There are female animals that cannot have babies. If the female has not been tested by the vet, then both dogs should be tested before you try again.  -!-|`|3giaPYe8aa	Oh, so I see that you are coming back for round two.

It's because you don't even know what one is!  You might want to run to Scamps to meet your new best friends....the owners.  I've got an idea, why don't you stick to Chia Pets.

Then you use this incredible lame excuse for why you are breeding dogs.  There are no little dogs in shelters.  Oh for gawds sake, go on Petfinders.com.  And besides that, you, who is breeding a couple of mutts, is STRONGLY against breeding purebred dogs and against the dog shows.  You know what?  The responsible breeders out there have NOT screwed up the breeding by inbreeding diseases and weaknesses.  THAT IS WHAT BACK YARD BREEDERS AND PUPPY MILLS DO.

Because we care about dogs and their health and lives? Shame on YOU because you don't.<br>  Dogs are living creatures. They deserve better lives than any of the human beings I know, or might ever know.<br>  Purebreds are healthier than many mutts. Why? Because the breeders spend extensive amounts of time and money making sure that the dogs they breed are healthy and sound -- and won't produce UNHEALTHY animals.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  As for the "health" of your dogs.

The people who have screwed up purebreds are the ones who breed without any health tests or genetic screenings. I'm guessing you don't do any of that either. Mutts are not automatically healthier than purebreds, and if you don't put any effort into ensuring that you're breeding healthy dogs you're likely to get unhealthy puppies.<br>  <br>  Trust me, you aren't doing your town any favors by producing small dogs.

He could diabetes.  By the way aspca says it runs about even between large and small dogs, my group just saved 50 small dogs from the city shelter.  They would have been put down today and tomorrow.  This is the second time we have had to do this in less than 6 months, so it seems maybe your area is just odd.  I never bred my Batman if I have no place for the puppies to go ahead of time.  I have a health certificate  for him.  He is free of genetic flaws.  He as been tested for temperament, past with a 98 % far above almost any other dog this person as tested.  My uncle bred pur blood dogs never inbred at all, only poor breeders due that.  My family as been involved in dog breeding for over 100 years.  I do know what I talking about.  Unlike others here, I think there is nothing wrong with breeding a mixed breed dog as long as they are healthy.  You should not fall to the others level, hope you get your puppies and they are healthy.  More than you wish for mine, right.|`|EWXzNyk8aa	There are many things that I could correct you on here, but I will just stick to one.<br>  <br>  You stated that "PPurebreeders have really screwed up lots of dogs with inbred genetic diseases and weaknessses." This is only true of irresponsible backyard breeders who don't health test their dogs before breeding (by the way, are your dog and your friend's dog health tested? even if they are not purebred you better have health tested them with all the proper tests and especially to rule against anything that is prone to your breed - but yours is a mix so you better just do them all! Pretty spendy.. Now with responsible breeders it is actually a proven fact that inbreeding/line breeding is helpful to the lines because if you have two dogs that are great examples of the breed and they are pretty closely related, and you breed them, they will produce excellent pups because their good genes combined and their bad genes covered each other's up. Line breeding is actually not "frowned upon" by thereputablee responsible breeders because it helps the breed. Please do your research and learn from what the other answers are telling you too. You are acting very irresponsible with your dog, and you are being very ignorant. Open your mind, and listen to what the experienced people are telling you. I don't know much either, I am still learning too.|`|TJGje2blaa	You go with whatever you want.  It could be that you just aren't giving them time to themselves enough.  Put them where-ever you want & leave them along; don't sit back and let them see you watching them.  You can peek in about every 15 minutes, cause if they tie-up, they'll still be tied up within this length of time.  If you see them tied-up, just go your way & leave them be cause it'll take a while for them to un-tie.  My male was smaller and didn't figure it out, the first time around.  He sure did, the next time around though.|`|vouUQQzBaa	Anti-breeder? No. I disapprove on breeding just for the sake of it.<br>  <br>  Breeding should be done NOT with mutts (we already have enough) but with purebreds.<br>  <br>  Breeding should be left to those who LOVE the breed they work with and would like to help it evolve. For health, looks, temperament..etc..etc..<br>  <br>  Breeding should be done by those who CAN afford the expenses and will do all the necessary testings (including genetic tests) and be ready for emergencies.<br>  <br>  So that's great, you have 2 nice small dogs with great temperaments. Perfect pets, yet you cannot guarantee on health since you do not KNOW where they come from, what's in their background.<br>  <br>  Sorry, this is insane. You are trying to excuse your behavior which isn't acceptable at all

It doesn't have any bones in it so that's good, my chihuahua is so picky she doesn't like to eat dog food, so we have to feed her human food.|`|557vqKhdaa	1 way to know try it if bones r in it the<br>   dog might or will choke and die.|`|ead5TBZWaa	as long as you romove any bones and only give him  some occasionally.|`|EnLs16HLaa	yess it definately is :)

Unless, you're seeing other signs or having issues with him. You can probably do a search for more information.     ETA: I found a picture that shows the "chin-over", scroll towards the bottom of the page. http://www.umich.edu/news/MT/02/Fal02/7s...    ETA: Hmmm, now it's not working. Try a search for: "dog dominance chin over" or "In the Company of Dogs" and "University of Michigan"...that's the article/website the picture came from anyhow. This is what it said under the picture: "Chin-Overs: A common dominance display in play and during greetings, the chin-over can be executed quickly, almost before the other dog realizes it's happening." Here's another website that mentions it, but I haven't read through the entire article. Anyhow, look under "Some Behaviors that May Indicate Dominance". http://www.joycefay.com/articles/dominan...

Doing so may result in a torn up or even a dead female. Only pairs properly conditioned to breed can be kept together, and even then the female has to be removed immediately after.

It's best to avoid a bad situation and return the female.<br>  <br>  Male Betta's can be great community fish. The tank must be large enough and certain fish should be avoided. Guppies, gouramis, long finned fish, known fin nippers, and obviously other male and female Betta's.<br>  <br>  ~EDIT~ I am also a pet store employee, and I never tell customers it is okay to add males and females together.

s9pOojcMaa	my shih tzu has the same problem it is because they have many many alergies mine has alergies to flea bites and many other things that makes him bite and scratch himself the only medicine that will help is very expencive it is called atopica and it is like $150 a month but take him to the vet and can u plz email me with wut ever ur vet says cuz it might help my dog to     thanx    ~*C?J*~|`|f8a3e1916a1358a55f2e47b7e870da88aa	poor little guy.  you can go to a pet store they sell what is called an e-collar. this is something he can wear around his neck and it will keep him from tearing at his skin.  if it's been more than 48 hours since you applied the flea prevention you can bathe him in an oatmeal shampoo to help with the irritation.  do not give benadryl unless directed by your vet.  any human med given or suggested by anyone other than your vet can be dangerous for the dog.  and defiantly take him into the vet as soon as you can.  all you can do for now is try the oatmeal bath and the e-collar to help him until the vet reopens.  good luck.|`|51e23c73d171b11d50a434dac7068f4faa	If he's chewing the area, you can get an elizabethan collar from the pet store (those satellite-dish looking things).    Get him to the vet ASAP, though, because those types of sores can be really uncomfortable and dogs really will mess with them.  the vet might be able to give you some cream or ointment for it.|`|25Yz03hAaa	you could put tube socks up his legs and pin them together at the top. At least that would stop him from scratching himself as hard.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	It's hard to keep them from licking and scratching.  You could try covering it with gauze, if you have some.  You can also buy a cone collar from the store and put it on him.  If you're really desperate right now, you could cut out a cone and make your own cone collar to put on him temporarily, and it will keep him from chewing and licking himself.

OnZDg0AEaa	hi,<br>  <br>  The term gets tossed around casually, but separation anxiety is a very serious matter. True separation anxiety is your dog's panicked response to being left alone. The results--including the destruction of your belongings and the deterioration of your dog's mental and physical health--can be devastating.<br>  here's a treatment:<br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/separation-anxiety.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/separation-anxiety.ht...</a><br>  <br>  hope his helps.|`|f0egZ7Sdaa	Confine him to a very small area in your home until he can be trusted in your home.<br>  <br>  Most people will secure off the kitchen so when their pup does pee or poop, it's easier to clean. Others will crate train so that the pup does not pee or poop at all. With this, young pups need to be let out often to relieve themselves.|`|Szv4G3v4aa	Are you sure he has separation anxiety? And, also what do you mean by "off-crate"? I wouldn't let a puppy roam the house while I'm not home. I recomend leaving him in his crate.<br>  I think you would get your best answers from a real trainer. Try finding a local trainer in your area and ask him/her. If you don't know any, try your local yellow pages, and sometimes even pet store bulletin boards.
P0N3uhOCaa	I think that it's confusing for dogs to go in the house, whether it be on pads, or on newspaper. I think that it sends the message that it's ok to go in the house.     You're doing a good job by correcting him, taking him out. I cannot remember how old your poodle is, but consider crating him. You don't have to keep him the crate at all times, but when you cannot supervise and during the night this will cut down on accidents.    Also, this is just my recommendation, but I think you should get rid of the newspaper and never leave your boy unsupervised.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	It might help to give him treats and praise when he goes where you want him to.  Make a big deal out of it so he understands what he's supposed to do.|`|iJyBrB1waa	hes still doing it because of you letting him use the newspaper... he gets to go in the house so he may go on anything that remotely looks like a newspaper or smells like one... try the puppy pads they have a scent that makes them want to go on it and since that scent will be different from the other house smells it should help him... this worked for all 5 of my puppies that my dog had and our other 2 dogs as well   also if you have carpet or wood flooring the places he goes in the house will still smell like his pee or poo if you dont buy a pet odor and stain remover and spray the spot and if the spot still smells like it he will go there again|`|6wJCPCNaaa	Have just read the replies to this question, and I would agree with the advice to get rid of the newspaper, EXCEPT this is a TOY poodle. I have found the toy breeds are not clean in the house, no matter how hard I try. My other breeds have been so easy and were housetrained by 10 weeks - then I got into toy dogs. I thought it was because little old ladies and lazy breeders couldn't be bothered to try and teach them to go outside - boy, was I wrong.   With toys, it seems the pee pads are the way to go. Make sure they are always in the same place, and clean. And you can buy sani-belts for boy toys - these fasten with velcro and there is a pocket in front to insert papertowel or small femine napkin (sorry guys) to absorb moisture if he does decide to pee inside. Of course you can't leave this on him for hours on end, just when you can't be watching him.  Also, if he is peeing a lot, it may be a bladder infection, and beyond his control.|`|mxyN0zknaa	If you let him pee inside, on pee pads or newspapers or anything else, he will think that peeing inside is ok.  He cannot necessarily tell the difference between newspaper and carpeting.  It is probably all the same to him.    It is all inside and he needs to go so he does.  It is pretty logical.    The best thing is to get rid of newspapers and pee pads and take him outside all the time even if you have to get up in the middle of the night or very early in the morning.  You have to clean up the inside completely with an enzymatic cleaner so he does not have a reminder.    You need to get him before he goes inside, put him outside, encourage him to get busy and when he does give him a treat while he is going or immediately after and then take him for a nice walk or play.  He will soon figure out (poodles are very smart) that going outside means treats and walks.    If you see an accident inside, clean it up and ignore it.  It is too late to try and explain things to him so move on and keep taking him outside.  Keep an eye on him inside or use a crate to help you if he likes crates.|`|bb60640c96610ff5b7eb5df5251f191caa	You taught him its ok.     Get rid of the paper, buy a crate, and teach him to outside only.     He's confused. When you let a dog use papers or pads in the house you are teaching them its ok to eliminate indoors, anywhere indoors is now fair game.     http://www.tiaspetplace.com/housetrainin...|`|kRqeBB0gaa	Just try to keep it simple. Avoid the paper and pad. Get a crate just big enough for him to stand and lay in. If you buy one that is too big, it will pee on one end and sleep in the other. You want to teach your dog to hold it. I'm not sure how old your dog is but a good way to calculate how long a dog should be able to hold it is by taking its age in months and adding 1 to it. ie. if your dog is 2 months old, do not expect it to hold it for more than 3 hours. If your dog is young, it may not be able to hold it through the night. So just like a baby, you will have to get up in the middle of the night (when he is crying) to let him out. When he does, quietly praise him and give him a treat. Also, when you let him out of his crate, pick him up and put him where you want him to eliminate. You do not want the first thing to touch his feet be the carpet when he is ready to go. If you do, his instincts will tell him to go on the carpet. Do not let him play in the house until he has eliminated outside first. If he has been playing inside the house for about 30min-1hr then let him out again. Never leave food and water out all day. Feed him the same time everyday and only allow him 20 minutes to eat then take him out 20 minutes after he has eaten. This will help you monitor when he needs to go. Always take him out: 1st thing in the morning, before bed, 20 minutes after eating/drinking, after every nap, after playing for awhile. Since he is still learning, do not give him run of the house. Keep him close by so you can always keep your eyes on him and prevent him from eliminating indoors when you see him get into position. You are doing good in correcting him.

Como outros anuros, possui membrana nictante e pulm?es quando adulta, mas sua respira??o se d principalmente pela pele.    Alimenta-se de insectos, vermes e outros pequenos animais, sendo quase sempre carnvoros, que captura com a lngua, inserida na frente da boca. Emite sons variados que servem para diferentes propsitos como atra??o da fmea e delimita??o da territorialidade com outros machos. Algumas poucas espcies possuem glandulas paratides produtoras de veneno, que no entanto s?o uma protec??o passiva, j que n?o possuem mecanismos de inocula??o e s tm efeito quando em contato com mucosas.

qDku83JNaa	Oh, YAH I have two peacock eels! I'll tell you this, I have had them in a gravel tank by themselves for the longest time (my fish keep dying so screw them) and they just never die! it's wonderful! I use to have a group of neon tetras and even though the pet store guy said they might eat my fish, they never did.  even when I put ghost shrimp in there, they didn't eat them. <br>  <br>  the first eel I got, would always bury himself in the gravel, he  was  very shy. but the second one I got always swam around the tank openly, so each fish is different, thought I'll say they like to be around each other a lot. also, they seems to appreciate having a rock cave instead of always having to bury themselves. I put a cheap little plastic rock cave in my tank for them and they love it!!!<br>  <br>  OK< most important! they won't behave happily if you have gravel! I had them in gravel for a year, and eventually they stopped digging because they hate gravel! I went to my fish place and bought a 10 dollar bag of fishy sand, and it really makes a difference, and it makes my tank seem cleaner and more natural. <br>  <br>  NOW, I had never ever seen my peacock eels eat until I saw that people said they like to eat 'black-worms'! it's like, a dollar for a tablespoon of  these tiny worms, and you dump them into the sand and they burry themselves, it was so amazing when one floated past my eels face and he smelt it and just went crazy, he love to use his snout to dig them up and eat them, sometimes i use an eyedropper to suck them out of the sand and feed them, and they aren't shy anymore, the one that always burried under the sand, now when he see's the  eyedropper he comes out of the rock cave and starts sticking his nose into it before I can blow them in front of him.<br>  <br>  over all, when they don't have the right enviornment, they don't act well, but when they do, it's wonderful to have them. especially when  you feed them~|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Weekly water changes should be done on an appropriately stocked aquarium.

So cute. They have distinctive black-and-white markings (inverted black v-shape behind the ears) but the colors might have changed with breeding since I had one as a kid. Their legs are longer, bodies shorter and they are not as muscular as Jack Russels. I have not really seen a pure bred specimen of the other dogs you have listed, so I can't compare.|`|YJmGf4RLaa	the parson & jack russel are the same thing     fox & rat terriers are similiar - go to AKC's web site & look them up|`|c56769faa6a17951afc2da21c4ffceeeaa	All those breeds are very similar, you'd have to take some measurements and compare, the jack russell/Parson russell is the most common, at least around where I live, but we see a lot of rat terriers too.  It could also be a mix of one of the above.  A picture would help, the whole dog not just his face.  If you really want to know, you can have your dog genetically tested to determine its breed or breed mix, but I don't remember the name of the company that does it.  You could also check the AKC's website, they have very detailed breed standards that are actually accurate.|`|xwUzmMsKaa	try akc.org it will help more.... maybe...they are all very close in looks|`|OFpl236faa	Jack Russell Terriers are the same as Parson Russell Terriers. The breed standard is 15" or under. There is a Puddin' Jack Russell that is squatier and has shorter legs. True Jacks are square in hight and length. They come in a smooth, broken and rough coat. They were used on the fox hunts and to flush out the foxes out of their holes. AKC wanted to separate themselves from the JRT clubs. It's just  a way to get money. Parson's/JRT's can't be registered in both AKC and the JRT clubs. AKC tends to ruin breeds and breeders for AKC tend to breed more for looks then instinct. Fox Terriers are also a hunting breed. They were also used to flush out the foxes. Fox Terriers have pointier noses and are very elegant looking. They come in either a wired(longer) coat or a smooth coat. Rat Terriers were used to hunt rats in the white house. They are shorter and stalkier. They come in a smooth coat.|`|2SwiwhqNaa	i don't know.  but i know if you mate a pit bull with a sczitsu the offspring is a bullschitz|`|cca354c45210c070973887c85f9adec1aa	did u see images?|`|P1mi6pUYaa	A Jack Russell and a Parson Russell are the same thing.

wbZp6ZcPaa	I would suggest finding a trainer in your area. We used a puppy pen and newspapers to train our dog but it still was an involved process that took a great deal of patience. If you don't want to use a trainer you can read the book 'A Perfect puppy' we found it super helpful. Good luck!|`|8qECRiuMaa	we had the same problum but wat we did is leave the door of the crate open during the day so that she would sleep in there reguraly. also try putting a blanket over the top of the crate but make sure that ur puppy can get air. lastly talk to him while he is in the crate and give him or her toys to put in there that way they think of it as a good place to be|`|OnZDg0AEaa	hi,<br>  <br>  Some people worry that crate confinement is cruel, but if you do it right, your dog won't see it that way at all. His crate can be a cozy den where he retreats from household chaos or just relaxes. And once he's housetrained, your dog will have the run of the house as well as a nice little den of his own--just leave the door open for him.<br>  here are some guidelines:<br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/housetraining-crate-training.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/housetraining-crate-t...</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|C9VXUKGpaa	Try reintroducing the crate with lots of treats and praise.Slowly increase the time he is in there. Make sure he goes out and does his business before getting crated. Give him something to do. If the crate is in a separate room move it to where you are. if the crate is to big try making a blocker for the excess room until he gets bigger. if need be there is anxiety relief|`|eWfkM5vpaa	This may not help too much but puppies sleep great with the tick-tock sound of a clock,and a warm blanket. Good luck to you!|`|OFpl236faa	How old is the puppy? You should not let him pee or poop inside the crate. The crate is supposed to be like a den and somewhere for the dog to sleep and be in when you can not be watching him. Are you crating at all during the day? You need to make it a good place to be and be consistent. Puppies are like little kids, so a routine is good to have. Take water and food away around 8 PM so that there are less night time accidents. Make sure you tire him out before bed! We tried to keep our puppy awake and played with him, walked him and tired him out. That way when we took him to his crate he is so tired that he won't want to howl for as long or as much. We always give treats, even to the adult dogs, when they go in the crate. There should be at least a sheet or a bed in the crate to make it more comfortable. You can try to cover his crate with a sheet so he can't see out, helps some dogs. Also make sure to do one last potty walk before you go to bed.|`|Szv4G3v4aa	Are you taking him out after he has eaten/drunk something? Are you praising him for going potty outside? One way you can tell that a dog has to go to the bathroom is when they start turning circles, or sniffing around. <br>  I think you would get your best answers from a real trainer. Try finding a local trainer in your area and ask him/her. If you don't know any, try your local yellow pages, and sometimes even pet store bulletin boards.|`|CNhmtKDaaa	Instead of a crate you can try using a puppy pen|`|Uhasekptaa	you go to train him or her when they are 10 months old

Also, when you remove the filter, keep them moist like in a bowl of water (best would be the fish tank water), so the beneficial bacterias will not die off.|`|Y1cKH9Tgaa	try this web sight it help my Brother<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.westcoastpetsupply.com/1/aquarium-ich-medications" rel="nofollow">http://www.westcoastpetsupply.com/1/aqua...</a>
kqa9VFrfaa	Is this a kitten or a cat? Kittens are pretty easy to age up until they finish cutting their teeth. Adult cats how harder to tell. When a cat gets past prime they slow down. get groves in their teeth, and loose some of the muscle fat around their shoulder blades and hips. So if the have a kind of gaunt look about them, and the teeth are pitted U know they are past prime.<br>  Kittens under the age of one year are more playful and cuddly. Also kits from 8 weeks to 5 months seem to have very big ears and eyes according to the rest of their body.

Vc faria essas ra?as serem extintas?  D uma olhada ai do lado!!! Essa  minha filhinha, o AMOR da minha vida, uma das coisas mais importantes pra mim.  Nunca pensei nisso, mas se tiver que escolher, escolheria os humanos. Sim, aqueles que pegam cachorros dessa ra?a s por estatus e na verdade n?o sebe nem cuidar de si mesmo.  Tenho muita d do cachorro,  ele que paga mais caro por tudo que acontece. O c?o  criado amarrado, passa fome , sede, apanha, quando ele tem a oportunidade de sair o que aconte?e? Tudo isso que ns vemos!!!!!  Minha cachorra foi atacada por um rot, ele estava amarrado com uma corrente fina, o port?o da casa estava aberto e eu estava passando na rua de baixo com ela, s vi aquele cachor?o vindo pra cima de ns. Eu larguei a guia e a minha cachorra come?ou  apanhar e a tentar fugir do rot, foram trez minutos que demoraram uma eternidade, minha cachorra (que  essa pit) levou quatro pontos no peito, mais algumas dentadas e tremia igual vara verde, a sorte  que eu tinha acabado de tirar a fucinheira pra ela tomar gua, e s n?o foi pior porque o enforcador dela tem garras que n?o deixou o rot segurar no pesco?o.   Viu como pit bull  violento!!!!  c?o de batalha, de briga n?  Ent?o porque ela invez de enfrentar o rot que  do mesmo tamanho dela, ela tentava fugir? Talvez porque eu nunca ensinei ela  brigar, porque ela n?o tem raiva de outros cachorros e pessoas,( j assaltaram minha casa com ela dentro) Essa ai  violentssima.|`|TNGRAO0waa	Sinceramente n?o.

Vai depender da cria??o e cuidados dispensados por sobre cada cachorro. A minha sogra tem um Pit-bull que  mais manso que a minha Daschung.  Conhe?o tambm rotweilers que n?o atacam nem gato, mais isso depende de quanto carinho e aten??o voc d a eles.

ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	My dogs get walked every day, AND they go to obedience and agility classes AND they go to dog shows.    They do not have fleas.|`|6pzCNM5Caa	My dogs go all over the place, including dog parks, training facilities and dogshows.  No fleas.      We moved into a flea infested house, had to treat the house once.. got rid of the living room carpet (lots of vacumning the rest of the house), the yard we've treated twice and the dogs are treated on a monthly basis with Advantage.  No more fleas.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	You have to give them Frontline every month so they can't get infested with fleas.  It kills the fleas on them.|`|ciHFPgUPaa	Well if your taking them for walks in some kind of feild were theirs lots of squirrels, ground hogs, and wild animals, thats were they keep getting it from. Especially if there are ground hog holes and they stick there heads in it. They can also get it from birds. Once you get rid of the fleas i suggest taking them for a walk somewhere else, and see if it happens again. My dogs haven't had fleas, but they are only 8 months old. We have also traveled out of provinces so we get this stuff called reveloution, its for heartworm and fleas, its a cream and you put it on them every month or somthing and they cant get flees. Hope I help!|`|PF6VKIATaa	get flea spray or powder or k-9 advantage
4vwCIdClaa	My puppy had the same thing and the vet said it was normal|`|P1mi6pUYaa	It's normal for them to poop out the worms.  I'd call the vet just to ask if the blood is normal.|`|143a844a8d8e9a3769389ba7cdda7ba6aa	well id call the vet|`|ZHYWrd2Caa	yes it is. it means the medicine is working really good. your pup should be cured in no time!
eWfkM5vpaa	Blood rings are a sign of death BUT IT MIGHT BE A MISREADING!Don't give up yet,if you see the little heart beating and the embryo moving,it is probably still growing, leave it in the incubator until the "expiration date"don't give up hope! it might hatch! Im trying to hatch chicks right now and i haven't even had that much luck!!! Good luck to you and your little ducky! : )|`|rQlzfHqraa	Blood ring or not a beating heart and embryo movement is a live embryo. Leave till two or three days past the hatching date to be sure.
uiap87thaa	Go with the direction of the fur;    They often like chin and ears scratched/rubbed;    If you don't know the cat well, avoid the belly and the back near the base of the tail as these are often sensitive spots on a cat and it might lash out at you|`|BQS0opnQaa	Like any other animal...Don't really know what esle to tell ya|`|237f1ac86701e8329544cf520d189437aa	R U 4REAL|`|pASHauVsaa	put you hand on it and slide it down then up then down so and so forth and they love under theire chins rubbed|`|x14OSRbUaa	How do you remember to breathe?
In1UqryNaa	The first night she will be tired and lethargic from the medication they gave her.  She'll propably want to just lay around and sleep that first night, keep her warm, and well hydrated and in a smaller room with blankets for her to lay on. If she has a crate leave her in that while your gone.  The incision might be tender but shouldn't bother her after a few days.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	My vet keeps the dog overnight to monitor them after the surgery.  I don't think this is necessary, but it is possible if it would make you feel better.    Usually, they give the dog pain medication, and she'll still be sleepy for at least the first day.  After a few days, she be as good as new, though.  You just have to be gentle with her because of her stitches.  Make sure she doesn't chew them or try to pull them out.  They'll tell you not to let her play too rough for a week or two, just to be safe.  But generally, she'll just sleep a lot and rest.|`|Ug6Rm1exaa	After the operation your dog will need to go pee a lot.  Forewarned.    Also you'll need a good crate with clean (washed daily) sheets.  It will take awhile (~3 weeks to full health).  If they offer laser instead of knife your dog will heal better and faster.|`|LhJc7Doqaa	Are they going to keep her overnight? If so, there is not much you'll need to do when you bring her home. She'll just need to sleep off the meds she'll be receiving & she won't be very hungry but she'll be thirsty (again, the meds). Just don't expect her to be real active & keep her stitches dry. You'll notice a little redness & swelling but there should not be any drainage. You'll be surprised that it won't take her but 3 or 4 days to want to play & become her normal self.  If they do not keep her overnight, someone will need to be with her after you bring her home at least overnight. That way you'll know if she has alot of trouble dealing with the meds & any abnormal bleeding. She'll be drowsy & have trouble with balance so you'll need to really watch her when she goes outside to relieve herself.  And even though you may feel bad that she is uncomfortable for a couple days, she'll be so much healthier & you both won't have to worry about heat cycles & unwanted pregnancies. Congrats on your new addition.|`|OutLojh7aa	She should be ok, but if you can get a collar ask the vet if this might help since she will be alone. The only thing my minature  schnauzer did was she wanted to lick the incision.  She was a 9 month old.|`|bLng1pUbaa	If you will be away then you should confine her to one room or a small area just so she cannot run or jump.  You usually need to restrict activities for 10-14 days.  When you bring her home she may be a bit groggy from the anesthesia but you should be alright.|`|3p3otDlXaa	The recovery will be fine.  You must have a friend come over who can feed it and let it out enough.
5d3067153b27777a071a8f609e8d9e4aaa	all dogs can bark, It is not so much the breed as it is the dog it self. As one Havanese might bark alot but it's littler mate will not.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	My neighbor's Havanese doesn't bark hardly at all.|`|0Fxcgjreaa	I have a 2.5 yr. old Havanese.  She only barks if someone she doesn't know comes to the door or she hears a strange noise.  Then it's only one or two woofs.  They are great dogs.  Known as good watchdogs (alert you), but not guard dogs - only 8-13 's!
P1mi6pUYaa	It depends on the individual dog.  Each one is different.  Try getting a few different kinds to see what he likes.  Maybe a stuffed one with a squeeker, a rope, and one that's just a plastic squeeky toy.  If you want, you could try the Hide-A-Squirrel.  It's a stuffed log, and it comes with 3 little squirrel toys you put in the log.  The dog learns to get them out himself.  Every dog I know has one and they love it.  You could also get him a Buster Ball, a ball you fill with treats.  He rolls it around and the treats fall out one by one.  Lots of beagles like that because they like food.|`|TXE2NHGXaa	I have a beagle and she rips every stuffed toy apart in about 2 minutes.  it's kind of a waste of money.  You could try raw hides, Greenies, Chew-ez, any "long lasting" chew treat.  One thing my beagle loves is her Kong.  I stuff it w/ all sorts of stuff, peanut butter, some treats, sometimes cheese, a whole mix of things.  I heard of one person making a tuna mixture, freezing it and giving it to her dog.  The tuna is good for them because of the omega-3 (good for skin). Freezing anything in a kong is good because than it takes them a bit longer to finish it. I also have a plastic ball that you can put small treats in which randomly releases the treats.  She'll roll that around for a long time.  My beagle definitely loves anything squeeky but it's hard to find something that she can't rip apart in record time.  You could try big meat bones.    Once I broke down and bought cow hooves from a pet store (specifically for dogs to chew on).  She LOVED them and she was busy for hours.  I thought I hit the jack pot.  Then the house started smelling like manure!  Pretty gross.  So we got rid of them.  I'm always on the search for something that will keep her busy for long periods of time.    Have fun with your beagle.  They are a great, stubborn, completely lovable breed.  Little stinkers-they'll get into anything.  Feel free to email me if you have any other beagle questions.  I could talk about mine forever...but I won't!  Have fun!!
qWdiY0Vnaa	I work with a great organization called Love of Labs, Indiana.  They are a lab rescue which fosters labs who are at risk of euthanasia all over the region.  You should consider a lab from them--there are so many that get put to sleep every year because they don't have homes.  We even get purebreds--I've fostered three so far and they've all been great dogs.  Look them up under www.lolin.org.  You can see pics of the available dogs on the site.  Good luck.|`|yc58PFmoaa	I have found the regional AKC club for labs in Indiana.  The website has a breeder referral program among other nice features.  The people in the breed club may be able to help you locate a breeder that uses dogs from the lines of your previous dog.  The members of the clubs are guardians of the breed and if they are not able to find a dog somehow related to your old dog, they will be able to help you find a great breeder or a perfect rescue.|`|4378ed52264821b7562610d522f16d09aa	may I ask why you need to have a decendant of his?  I know it is a sad time to loose a loved canine kid, as we have been there too.  But something I would ask myself first is why you need a decendant of his.  is it because that way you will have a part of him always with you?  or you want a pup like him?  both of these reasons are not good answers because you can not replace the pup nor can the new pup ever live up to the elder pups life.  Instead I would reccommend that you search out either a rescue pup or another breeder that you can trust.  This is something that I discuss with potentuall puppy parents that come to me that have just lost their canine kid, along with depending on their reasons I will discourage them from replacing the puppy promptly after the prior pup passes.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	I am so sorry to hear of your loss.  You must have taken good care of him for him to live to such an old age.  I do not know of the breeder you're talking about, but I do know that there are tons of purebred labs for adoption.  If you look on petfinder.com, you'll see their pictures and info on them.  I hope you find a new puppy when you are ready.  Good luck!|`|Zza8tF64aa	Why not call Labrador rescue and save a Lab who needs a home.  I know, how you feel after your Lab passed away. I have a black Lab  who I rescued and never regretted it for a moment. He gets along with our two other dogs and three cats. Labs are wonderful and gentle, sweet dogs. Good Luck.|`|2NpjxKwTaa	I think you can look for AKC breeders on the AKC website for your area. I would suggest like the others to contact a shelter in your area :)
2821e642f26e1d2d0daab24df234f001aa	I don't know about your dog, but I have a yellow labX that will pace like that when she has an upset stomach.  I usually will take her out and let her eat some grass, she throws up whatever was causing the upset (usually it's sticks she's eaten) and then she's fine.|`|2e853def177f0dc358c1df8eb4484cc5aa	tell it to knock it off.snap a news paper at it.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	Well, if you adopted her, you might not know what her living situation was before.  She might be very anxious because she's been abused or something bad has happened to her before.  Who knows what triggered it.  Don't coddle her, though.  Just act like everything is normal so she's reassured that everything is fine.    However, keep an eye on her, if she keeps acting weird or acts sick, take her to the vet.  She might not be feeling well.|`|O3q8Qvivaa	She needs you to leash her and put her in a down position, make her lie down and calm down.  don't talk to her and reassure her, just make her lie still calmly....Don't let her agitate herself into a frenzy. You just got her, she is settling in, she may have many issues and this is one of them. More will come out in time....by doing all the "active" stuff with her, you are telling her it is okay to be agitated/dominant aggressive behaviorly.|`|kaV4UJ7Paa	sounds like she is just a little uneasy ... don't hit or yell at her, it will just make it worse ... maybe she needs another walk. give her something to chew on to occupy her.|`|n5nZFtNQaa	I do rescue & I would say give her time she is nervous & not sure she is home yet.  Was a full blood panel done on her in the past year? If she continues to act this way I would see your vet in a few days to be safe.  Pacing can be nerves, give her time & show her lots of love, but don't over due the attention or it will be hard when you leave.  Have her sit for treats & before you put her food bowl down. Give her 15 minutes to eat, if she won't eat don't worry, just pick up the bowl & try later in the day again.  A lot of rescue dogs won't eat when nervous.  Good luck

WaXRmgPZaa	Check this out.  It is a list of Mini Assie breeders in Cal and the rest of the country and a list on how to tell if you've found a reputable breeder.  It's from the Mini Assie Shep Club of America.    I've seen some fabulous Mini Aussies in San Jose (not owned by a breeder) at the training club I go to.  It was drop dead gorgeous and sound.    I read the above answers.  Do your research before you take anyone's advice.  Not every dog that is currently not recognized by the AKC or what have you is a bad dog or bred by people unconcerned about the well-being of the breed.    Many breeds took many, many years before they were accepted by the AKC.  It is part of the normal process of things (procedure) that it may take years.  Records must be carefully kept, a working standard proposed, and I imagine several presentations to the standards commitee of the AKC.  I know this and I don't breed dogs!      Mini fox terriers are a perfect example of a recently accepted, excellently bred and developed dog breed.  They've been around for years though.  I had one when I was a little kid (I'm older than you may think).  Fabulous dog.  Not too many years ago, if I'd tell people about my childhood dog, they'd say "There's no such thing."  Did they think that the breed just popped up overnight?!  LOL.    Very dedicated people work long and hard on their breeding programs to develop their new breeds and take great care in doing it, too.     No disrespect judge.    but what do I know?|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	That's because there's no such thing as a "good" breeder of "toy" aussies.|`|qrjjo7AJaa	There's a reason for that.    I'm a judge for the Australian Shepherd Club of America in addition to being a judge for the AKC.    ASCA, and the AKC aussie parent club are totally opposed to these dogs.    You've got a great breed in Aussies.    You now have a group of people who are intentionally trying to breed miniature aussies without concern for other factors.    That's why you're having the problem.    Amber - I went to the website.  I've been involved with dogs for nearly 40 years.  If I had to guess there are a few thousand reputable breeders of Aussies throughout the country.  California, because of ASCA links, has a HUGE number.  This appears to be a group of people who have gotten together to form this group.  Nothing to say ANY recognized kennel club affiliation.  Not as an aussie person, but someone knowledgable in dogs, that's a REAL red flag.|`|yyP7f8mnaa	That's because responsible breeders don't breed so-called "toy" Aussies, only puppymillers do.  If you'd like an Australian Shepherd (which is NOT a toy breed, but a herding breed), you can get a referal to a responsible breeder from the Breed's Parent Club.  http://www.australianshepherds.org/   Statement from the Australian Shepherd Club:  Recently there has been a rise in the movement to breed miniature and toy versions of the Australian Shepherd.     The Miniature Australian Shepherd and the Toy Australian Shepherd are not recognized or considered varieties of the Australian Shepherd by this organization, the United States Australian Shepherd Association, Inc. (USASA), or by the American Kennel Club (AKC).   Since these dogs are not AKC registered, they cannot be verified by USASA as purebred, and therefore are not considered Australian Shepherds by this organization.    The USASA does not support the purposeful breeding of Miniature Australian Shepherds and Toy Australian Shepherds, and expects all members who have breeding programs to breed to the USASA/AKC recognized standard of excellence. The USASA further expects all members to be ever vigilant in the preservation and protection of the Australian Shepherd.|`|S4dxECPIaa	I'll assume you mean Minature Aussie.  As others have noted, this is not a recognized AKC breed.  So, it may be difficult to find someone who would be considered a hobby breeder.   I have seen a number of Mini Aussies in agility in the Sacramento area.  They were all high strung and spooky. They do seem to do well in agility, but they just don't have the sound temperament you find in good quality Aussies.  I'd suggest you go to some agility trials and check out the Mini Aussies and then decide if this is what you really want.  You at the same time could find smaller Aussies and find out who they were bred by.|`|E1vdI8Graa	Amber is an Idiot!!  There is nothing wrong with trying to develop a new breed, but everyone knows that nowadays....smaller sells!!!!!!  I believe that is what these...so called breeders are breeding this dog down for.    Dog breeds if you will actually study their histories are bred for a particular purpose.  Different breeds of terriers were developed for such things as hunting small rodents and animals that lived underground like badgers.  Rottweilers, Mastiff's, etc. bred for gaurding.  Hounds, retreivers, spaniels, etc. bred for hunting.  Collies, Shepards, (including the Austrailian Shepard), etc. bred for herding.  Pekingnese (which was bred to actually fit inside Chinese royalties' long sleeved robes, so as to bite anyone who got too close), the Maltese, Japanese Chins, etc. bred to be lap dogs.      So WHAT on God's green earth could they possibly be breeding this dog down for, except profit?  So if you would just think about that, before buying this so called "breed".|`|P1mi6pUYaa	Since only irresponsible breeders are breeding toy versions of aussies, it might be better to select a different small dog for you.  Or you could get a regular Aussie, if you are able to give it the exercise it needs.      I'm really glad you are considering how the breeder is, and whether they're  responsible before you buy.  It's so important not to support breeders who are in it for the money.  They end up hurting the dogs.      You could search on petfinder.com to see if there are any dogs you like.  I hope you find one!!|`|ODduTTaBaa	Thats because "toy" aussies and any toy dogs are unrealistic. There is no "good" breeder because they would just be a breeder breeding smaller aussies.|`|SMIrPoKBaa	What Aussie? There is Austrailian Cattle Dog,  Austrailian Kelpie, and there is the Austrailian Shepard.
AA10421992	No, they will not!!!|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	spayed females will not bleed, they will not come into heat and they will not breed with any other dogs.|`|AA11709234	A SPAYED female dog will NOT come into heat,bleed, or be bred by a male.|`|3cd72da5e9235e69ea921b92d62402c7aa	nope, once their spayed there's no breeding, mating or anything.  Males might still hump things after nuetering but females pretty much just quit.|`|LPEO6AsCaa	NO!  That's all gone when they get fixed.  They will never have another heat so they can't breed.|`|cd731a89d8c493e5a2e82406e38dcdb2aa	If she is spayed, she is unable to "breed", and no, she will not go into heat or bleed anymore.  She will not be omitting scent, so typically male dogs will not both a spayed female. Some males may still try to mount a spayed female, but due to the surgical alteration, she cannot get pregnant.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	If you get her spayed, she won't go into heat and bleed anymore.  And she usually won't mate with other dogs.  If she does, though, she still can't become pregnant after being spayed.
Qe04KxYoaa	You really cannot he is a mix so unless you want to spend a lot for a DNA test which is not really accurate you just have to accept him for what he is.|`|AA10356572	this link pretty much tells you how to know if your dog is a purebred or a mixed breed dog..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.helium.com/items/1353605-what-breed-is-my-dog" rel="nofollow">http://www.helium.com/items/1353605-what...</a><br>  <br>  its exellent help and covers all the bases...<br>  my guess is probably not.. but check the link|`|b0lmWhmMaa	without seeing a picture it'd be hard to tell. if he has shepherd in him, he will have longer hair, about medium length, compared to a lab. he might also have the darker golden shepherd coloring (does he have any black on him? like german shepherd coloring?)|`|EWXzNyk8aa	The only way to tell for sure is to have a DNA test done by a vet. It will tell you what breeds he is a mix of and what percent of each.
IuYekkPVaa	Whilst in North America, the outdoors is not considered safe for cats, the situation in the UK is very different and the vast majority of cats go outside without coming to any harm whatsoever.<br>  <br>  Cats Protection suggest keeping cats inside for the first month after moving house.  This is because they become so attached to their territory, that some of them try to find their way back to their old home.   It's worth having them microchipped before they go outside, so that if they do become lost, it will be easier for them to be reunited with you.<br>  <br>  I think you should keep them inside for a few more weeks, just to make sure that they have fully bonded with their new home.  When they begin rubbing their faces against furniture, doorways etc., this is a good sign because it means they are scent marking your home as their new territory.  <br>  <br>  When letting them outside for the first time, do it before you feed them.  If they are hungry, they will stay closer to home as they won't want to miss out on their next meal.  Only let them out for short periods during the daytime at first, and leave a door open, so that they can see they have a clear entry route back to the house.  You might want to accompany them outside at first, just to help build up their confidence in their new neighbourhood.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	I usually wait 2 weeks before I am brave enough to turn a new cat loose, but if they are driving U crazy U might try to take them out on a tether. <br>  When U do finally let them out be sure to put food and water out near the house too. Maybe even a few card board boxes for them to play in. I always make sure mine have a dry spot from the rain, and in really cold weather a wool blanket for snuggling. Cats are sometimes little house huggers, or sometimes roamers. U won't know till U release them. If U snack them at about the same time each day it helps them know when to check in. I hope they do not try ot go back where they came from. Good luck.|`|lLm5uIuDaa	Cats should never be allowed outside.  It's a kiss of death for them.

It'll be much healthier for your cats to be indoors where they are safe from poisons, loose dogs, other cats, cars, wild animals, malicious people... and so on (the list of dangers is quite long). Indoor cats live much longer, healthier lives than outdoor or indoor/outdoor cats and it's very possible to have a happy, well entertained indoor cat. It's also entirely possible to train a cat to walk on a harness/leash for safe outdoor trips.

It is much healthier for them and you.  They will get used to being indoor cats pretty quickly, even if they spent most of their time outside with their previous owners.  If you feel that you must let them out, keep them indoors for at least a month or a bit longer, so they get used to your place.  It might also be a good idea not to let them out at the same time, since it is more likely that they will come back to be with their companion. I don't have the data on hand to show the statistics, but indoor cats live longer and healthier lives, so you may want to consider making them indoor cats only.  Good luck.|`|0hHw5IK7aa	Generally the rule is to keep a new cat in for two weeks so that they can remember where they live. <br>  <br>  My cat got restless when we moved house, as she was used to roaming - so after a week I tied a washing line to her collar and let her roam the garden. This helped in more way than one - she was pleased to be outside and she scent marked the garden making it easier for her find her way home when she wandered further.<br>  <br>  Another good tip for when you let your cats out for the first time is to put butter on their paws. They lick it off, thus transferring their saliva onto their paws and leaving a scent trail for them to follow home.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Cats that live indoors live longer, healthier lives. Statistically, the life span of an indoor cat averages 12 to 14 years, whereas it is only about four years for the outdoor cat. More than 1 million outdoor cats are killed each year by dogs, traffic, and exposure to disease. In the long run, keeping your cat indoors will also save you money in vet bills.<br>  <br>  There are many risks that come with letting your cats roam free outside:<br>  - They have a much higher chance of catching diseases and other illnesses such as: Feline Leukemia (FeLV), Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP), Feline Herpes Virus (Rhinotracheitis), Feline Distemper, Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV), rabies, tapeworm, ringworm, heart worm, hypothermia and urinary tract infection<br>  - Ingesting chemicals or poisons such as pesticides, home garden products and car/motor products<br>  - Getting fleas or ticks<br>  - Injury/death due to dangerous traffic <br>  - Eating poisonous spiders, insects or plants<br>  - Injury/death due to cruel humans, hunters or neighbors<br>  - Attacks from dogs, other cats or wild animals <br>  - Other accidental injuries<br>  - Getting lost or stolen|`|1iLZqS8Waa	The best thing to do is keep them inside for a while, we usually keep ours in for a month so they can get used to there surroundings which will help them find there way home once they go out. Using this method seems to work for us, we've never had a cat that hasn't been able to find it's way home.<br>  <br>  When you decide to let them out it's best to go into the garden first so they can smell around at the different things. Some cats choose to stay in the garden when there first let out in new surroundings and then start to venture out further.<br>  <br>  hope this helps, take care x<br>  p.s when letting them outside make sure you put a coller on them, that way they won't be mistaken for a stray cat.|`|iZ2J85Hpaa	I had the same experience as you. What I did: I took my kitten out on a harness to beging with, let him alk around and wander abou, sniffing and getting to know his surroundings. Then I let him off the leash a couple of weeks later (he didn't run away, surprisingly). Finally we let him go out himself, and now he is a happy healthy outdoor cat and comes in every hour or so.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped and good luck..x|`|O0AfxH9Eaa	You need to keep them in for 3-5 weeks. AFter that you can let them out.

But that is about to change thanks to a partnership between a UConn researcher and a Dutch pharmaceutical company.<br>  <br>  Jerry Yang, an associate professor in the Department of Animal Science, has developed a transgenic rabbit that will produce a specialized variety of genetically altered milk. The milk will be extracted by the Dutch company Pharming and used to help people who have a debilitating disorder known as Pompe's disease.<br>  <br>  Pompe's disease affects the musculoskeletal system. People with the disease have problems converting glycogen to glucose in their muscles. Glucose serves as the energy source for muscle function. It is believed that by injecting a functional form of this enzyme into individuals suffering from Pompe's disease, the effects of the condition can be reduced or eliminated. Unfortunately, the supply of the enzyme is severely limited.<br>  <br>  But Yang's transgenic rabbit will change this. Pharming provided Yang with an alpha-glucosidase gene which Yang was able to implant in a rabbit genome through a microinjection process. The result is a female rabbit that produces about one gram of the enzyme per liter of milk. Rabbits were chosen because they breed quickly, mature quickly and are easy to care for.<br>  <br>  Yang's rabbit is one of a number of animals Pharming will use. The company plans to have its rabbit-milking facility on line in about two years. It expects to have about 200 rabbits which will be able to produce enough alpha-glucosidase for the world's Pompe's disease sufferers.<br>  <br>  "This is an excellent example of how biotechnology can dramatically improve people's lives," Yang said. "It is also a tremendous opportunity for the University because it puts us at the forefront of transgenic research."<br>  <br>  Yang also has been collaborating with Genzyme Transgenics Corp. of Framingham, Mass., and PPL Therapeutics in Edinburgh, Scotland, to produce transgenic rabbits with other genetic constructs|`|q0rLBQo2aa	If they're mommy rabbits with baby rabbits, they'd better have.<br>  <br>  Pets deserve more commitment and better care than such a vague question and such inexpert answers as you will mostly get on this site.

They are mass dog-breeding operations that have been around for decades. They continue to thrive because they prey on unwitting consumers who are smitten by too-cute-for-words puppies in pet store windows and on fancy websites.<br>  <br>  But behind the friendly facade of the local pet shop, the pastoral scenes on a "breeder's" website, or the neighborhood newspaper ad, there often lies a puppy mill. These canine breeding facilities house dogs in shockingly poor conditions. <br>  <br>  Life is particularly bad for "breeding stock," dogs who live their entire lives in cages and are continually bred for years, without human companionship and with little hope of ever becoming part of a family. <br>  <br>  These dogs receive little or no veterinary care and never see a bed, a treat or a toy.   After their fertility wanes, breeding animals are commonly killed, abandoned or sold to another mill. The annual result of all this breeding is hundreds of thousands of puppies, many with behavior and/or health problems.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Puppy Mills are like cow poop they are everywhere.

If you want to rescue an actual puppy mill dog, I'm sure you can Google puppy mills that are close to where you live and may be able to go to the actual mill and ask an owner (that's how a friend of mine got her dog, in a mill in Lancaster, PA).

JfBzzXQ4aa	Don't get your dog out too early.  Don't ask him to stand & watch a dozen dogs ahead of him run. Warm him up at the practice jump & then stand back away from the ring some. Turn your dog away from the ring. Now you have to get your dog engaged with you. Will he tug? You can tug with him & keep him focused on you. Or try doing little tricks with him, like high fives & weaving in & out of your legs, etc.  Or you can do little obedience "doodles" with him. Quick little heeling exercises, fronts & finishes, pivots, etc. My one dog likes to get up & hug with me & get special loves. Anything to keep your dog's attention off the dog running ahead. Having your dog engage with you before you go in the ring will help improve your runs too. This will get better, if you don't let him reinforce himself. Even the highest drive BC's learn how to wait their turn to run Agility. He'll learn the routine you expect of him waiting just like he has learned everything else. Good Luck.|`|x8Vgu6acaa	You need to work on focus exercises.  Teach your dog to focus on you.  Keep practicing it.  You need to convince your dog that you aree more interesting & exciting than the dog running.  I use a target clicker stick & treats with mine, but every dog is different.  You need to work on the focus starting with few distractions & work up to the major distractions.  <br>  <br>  I found that corrections did not work as well as the focusing exercises.with my dog|`|3zv2bbolaa	That behavior isn't herding, it is excitement based on prey drive.

Because the pinch collar is only a reinforcement, and correction, and you'd only be able to use it before it's your turn. <br>  Make sure your dog knows you are the alpha. Your dog might not totally realize that.|`|d2191893763b20a6b077367a131978aaaa	bcdawgma has given you the best advice.<br>  <br>  To my knowledge, pinch collars are not even allowed on show grounds. Although I can't stand head halters, you might try one.<br>  <br>  This is simply a training issue. Not that I am saying it is a "simple" training issue! <br>  <br>  I understand what you are dealing with, I see it all the time at trials. Fortunately my BC is nice on line: she only lays there, quivering and whining as she stares at the dog running ;-)<br>  <br>  You need to decide how nuts this is making you. Are you willing to really take the time to fix it? You may need to refrain from going to trials for a while, use agility classes to only work on this problem, go back to obedience classes. <br>  <br>  You need "focus on you" training, or if you find it too difficult to be more interesting than a moving object ;-)  at least a "lay down and behave".<br>  <br>  Work on tug play: as soon as distracted, move away and offer toy. Tugging does not need to be a loud, distracting game to dogs around you. You can keep the dog focused on you at ringside, 10 feet away, then set down tug or hand off to someone as you go into the ring.<br>  <br>  While training, you can try making him lay down and stepping on leash. <br>  <br>  If can't be nice and quiet standing in line at training, put him in the car. If nice, let him run his turn.<br>  <br>  It can be done, but only if you are willing to dedicate the time.|`|OFpl236faa	Well you have a Border Collie and yes, they are bred to herd! You aren't allowed to use pinch collars in competition, so really, it would only help when training. You have to learn what motivates your dog and yes, you do need to pay attention to where your dog is and distract them from the other dogs running. He really wants to play and you are letting him control you. You can teach him to tug and play tug before your turn. Also lots of focus games! Your instructor can help you with those. Have you looked into a Halti?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petco.com/product/6008/Coastal-Halti-Headcollars.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.petco.com/product/6008/Coasta...</a><br>  <br>  This way you have better control over his face. You do have to be careful so you don't hurt their neck. Has done wonders for our reactive dog. <br>  <br>  You have to find ways to make you more interesting. My dog also likes to watch, so my requirement is that she has to lay down and be quiet, but she can watch. She also has to look at me when I ask and be able to function if I ask for something such as sit, left/right, around and come to side. You have to take control and do it now before it becomes a bigger problem. You need to come up with warm up games that you can do before your turn. Come up with what is acceptable to you and enforce that and stick to it.<br>  <br>  Border Collies are very sensitive to motion and it's very hard for them to look away. You have to be consistent and persistent. This isn't going to change over night and is going to take some time. Also look into the book Controlled Unleashed. Might help you get better control.|`|veDvtYhJaa	Davey, a BC is one of the most EASILY TRAINED dogs!<br>  BUT<br>  YOU must take your role as pack leader or your dog won't pay attention to you.  BC were bred to work with a handler and your dog doesn't work well with you considering what you stated.  You should be able to EASILY command this dog to "Leave it" without using a pinch collar.  If your dog went wild when you used a pinch collar that way, then you used it WRONG!  <br>  <br>  Stop with that collar.

He is young and not trialing yet, but we are trying to correct it now.  Now I have an advantage, he is a min pin and I can pick him up.  That will not work for you.  I know several people with BC's and GSD that have the same problem.  Some of them stay as far away as possible until the have to go in the ring.  Halti collars work wonders on a few dogs.  They wear them right up until they enter the ring.  The other thing I have seen is tugging.  A few people will tug with their dogs until they enter the ring.  They also do nto enter the ring until the dog in front stops running.  If you let the gate know the problem, most are cool with letting you wait.  I would not sue the pinch collar because again, they are not allowed at the trials.  Also, I would not want to flip the dog over, he could get hurt.  What does he have drive for?  Tugging, tennis balls?  Find that thing he can n ot live without, and use it before you run.  You may have to secretly hand it to someone as you enter the ring, but it should help.  Good luck|`|AE7W7Jspaa	First get rid of the pinch collar, most venues do not allow them to be used on trail grounds.  Second stop trialing, start training.  You need to get your dog focused on you in and out of the ring, or its only going to start degrading in the ring as well.  Get the yummiest, smelliest treats and his most favorite toy, these are things that are going to make an appearance only when training.  Go to a trial and find out how close you can get to the ring without him getting over the top. Get comfortable, get that smelly tasty treatout and sit and watch the runs, occaisionally say the dog's name and when he looks to you give the command "Look" with a treat in your hand point to your nose.  hold for a count of 5 reward  Do this a few times and then move a few feet closer, repeat.  Another self control technique is put a treat in your hand, again the smelliest tastiest you have, let the dog see it close your fist.  Let the dog paw at it, lick, nibble, nudge  whatever to your hand but dont open.  The MOMENT he stops  trying open your fist, if he attempts to grab it close your fist, no correction at all dont say a word or jerk your hand away just close your hand.  Repeat until the dog stays calm when you open your hand and waits for the treat to be offered.  Reward and Praise.  I use both of these tricks on my high drive aussie and my very very high drive bc, I will not tolerate craziness before a run,,.. you can tug, you can lay or sit quietly and watch you can play away from the ring, but you cannot loose your brain before a run and act like an idiot.  Its annoying to me and I know its annoying to the gate and other competitors.

zDBGLp3vaa	I have no idea why your vet said only wash him once a month, unless he was referring to the fact that most dog shampoos / dips are full of pesticides to kill fleas.  Too much of that can probably kill a small dog too.  However, as an alternative, you can bathe your dog weekly with Johnson's Baby Shampoo.  Smells really great, and, obviously, if it is safe to use on human babies, it will be safe for dogs.  I use it on my dogs (chihuahuas) all the time, and they have never suffered for it.  It makes them smell really good, makes their fur really clean and fluffy, and if I leave it on for at least 5 minutes before rinsing, it even kills fleas (by suffocation / drowning, not by pesiticides), if they get any before it is time for their monthly dose of flea killer.|`|AA10034577	Get the dog scent "Unleashed"|`|d5498018d53f97c8c7f315ec4d5ea570aa	First I would suggest washing your dog more often.  I have a shih tzu and give her a bath once a week with oatmeal shampoo and she is just fine.  Also the peke and the shih tzu have short snouts and large prominent eyes that causes them to tear alot.  The hair stays wet and bacteria starts to grow causing alot of staining and stinky faces.  It also causes the dogs to suffer with itchy eyes.  They need to be kept clean and dry.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	You can buy a spray meant to be sprayed onto the dog made by Nature's Miracle.  It really helps the smell.
f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	He is too young to be away from mom.. You aren't making sure that he is getting enough to drink.. He needs more water, or he will continue to be constipated.. Go grab a piece of toilet paper and snap that poop off for the poor little guy..   Make sure you are feeding him a good quality dog food, plenty of water to drink.. If he is not drinking the water on his own, pour water into the kibble.. That way he is forced to take in more moisture as he eats his kibble.. You will want to take him in to the vet if you can't get him to poop...|`|117561ad093a76ea5ed7fdde63921b46aa	Run some luke warm water in the tub and get some baby shampoo or even dish detergent if you don,t have baby shampoo,whatever soak his butt in the warm water and then soap his bottom up and get this poop off !You may even have to have help to clean him and when done maybe even trim around his anus to prevent this from happening again.He must be able to pass his poop or he will get sick!!If you can't do this take it to the Vet in the am and have the groomer show how it is done.Good Luck!!!|`|P1mi6pUYaa	He could have a blockage or really bad constipation.  He should see a vet ASAP.  I'd try to remove the poo, to see if it relieves him, but if he started acting like it hurts him when I try to remove it, I'd take him to the vet right away.  That's not normal.|`|jCr9YOxDaa	Try taking a warm wash cloth and softening it so it will clean off. Might take more than a second to get it to soften, but it will clean off this way. Don't make it too warm though as what feels warm to you may very well feel HOT to the puppy. And after that keep an eye on him so nothing hardens on him and he can stay clean. DO take the puppy to the vet...|`|p8KPAHSdaa	His poop should not be so hard that Oscar strains.  You can try a teaspoon of plain canned pumpkin in his dinner.  If you are feeding dry kibble, make sure you soak the food ahead of time with equal parts water.    For now I'd put a warm damp wash cloth on his butt. Don't rub, just try to soften the poop enough to remove it.|`|5296217da3d515e3bb0b674134d8bcf6aa	Use some disposable gloves and do not pull  hard.  You can get Senna (a natural laxative) the dose is one tablet, but if you are afraid to give that much due to age, it can be reduced to half a tablet. It is natural and will  not hurt animals.  He should be on puppy formula food and this should not happen.   I recommend Eukanuba or Pro Plan puppy formulas.  If he continues to have hard stool he could develop prolapsed rectum (where the rectum actually comes outside the body)    Hope this helps.  http://www.normandyboxers.com|`|bpFwWabaaa	Try weting the poo.Or pull it out|`|u72JBqoFaa	go 2 the animal clinic
P1mi6pUYaa	If he's a puppy, it's probably because he's teething.  It's normal.  But to stop him, you have to tell him "no" and take the thing away, and then give him a toy that's his and praise him when he takes it in his mouth.  You have to repeat over and over, and eventually he'll understand he's only allowed to chew his toys.|`|FiqYQQ53aa	by him a rough chew toy|`|413cfb7eef158b727cd15e4e110059a4aa	Is he teething?

14Z1vZjLaa	Do you mean tear stains?  The black streaks under your dog's eyes?  With those, you have to be really consisitent.  Check your dogs eyes constantly.  If they are wet or crusty, wipe that area for a minute with a damp cloth.  When my chihuahua had them, I wiped her eyes at least 3 times everyday.  They got lighter then disappeared.  This espeicially common in white dogs and small breeds.  Small breeds have smaller tear glands and it is more noticable in white dogs.  I guess your poodle is small and white:)|`|1080fb65630076ed405789e80cd8e0c7aa	well what is it ? and you can give the dog a bath or take him to be groomed .and they'll take care of that .|`|P1mi6pUYaa	You can buy wipes from the pet supply store that remove the tear stains from white fur.  I've heard they work pretty well.  I think there are also wipes for the mouth area, but that area is harder to clean because they get their saliva on the fur, which makes it turn a reddish color.  Try the wipes, though.
trarVq8haa	My girl refused to lie down every single time I tried to coax her into it.  She gave up on cookies, she lost interest in toys and she tried to walk away from me.  What I ended up doing was putting her leash on her and stepping on it close enough to her collar so that she could sit hunched over, but not sit all the way up comfortably.  That way, she could choose to sit up uncomfortably, if she wanted to be stubborn or she could lie down and be completely comfortable.  She soon got tired of trying to maintain that weird sit position and when she started to lay down, I said, "Down" and when she got all the way down I said, "Good, Down" and gave her a cookie.  From then on, when I would give then down command, I would give her a chance and then if she didn't do it, I wouldn't repeat the command, but just step on the leash and give her a minute and then when she laid down I'd do the "Good, Down" and cookie bit again.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	Make him sit first, but instead of giving him the treat for sitting, take the treat and touch the floor with it.  Your dog will follow your hand with his nose, and try to get the treat.  Keep your hand touching the floor until he goes all the way down, and then say "down" and give him the treat and praise him.  You will have to repeat it before you can say "down" and then expect him to actually do it.  Also, practice this on carpet, as a lot of dogs will refuse to go down on a hard surface (I don't know why, but my dog refuses).|`|rXgMY4AIaa	Make the dog sit then take a treat and put it too the nose and keep putting your hand in front of the legs and that almost all the time works!!|`|AA11766909	just keep working at it. When he sits then you sort of put your hand on his back to keep frm getting up and pull his two front paws down to the flooor. Hold them there give him the treat and praise him...      Good Luck|`|zIWnoSSCaa	We taught our dogs by getting them in the sit position and than telling them to lay down with a treat in our hand and slowly moving the treat down  towards the ground and away from them and they followed our hand and ended up in lay down position than we would repeat "lay down" to them and reward them with the treat and eventually they caught on.  Hope this helps you!
yqefjKR5aa	It can be that he isn't fully house trained yet.    OR    It can be that he's being a yorkie. Some to most like to be a little tough guys and rulers of the house. The going in the house can be a result of you not giving attention to him. Set him on a daily time line of letting him out every 3 hours. This will keep his blatter empty and your house dry.|`|tVRdfGkiaa	He hates the crate. He does this after he's been in the crate?Why so you need the crate? Why can't he be where you are, part of the family?  He would be happier and so would you. Just a thought.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	I think it sounds like he's still a little shaky with housebreaking.  I would go back to crate training to reinforce the message.  He shouldn't be going potty in the house.  When you take him outside, give him treats and praise him for going potty.  Work on trying to get him to let you know when he needs to go out.  My dog doesn't bark, so I got bells for the door and he rings them.  You could try something like that.  He might partially have the idea, since he holds it when you are around.  But something isn't clicking with him if he does it when you leave.|`|trarVq8haa	I agree that his housebreaking sounds shaky.  If you can't pay attention to him and his housebreaking is shaky, he needs to be crated.  He needs to learn beyond a shadow of a doubt that the house is not his toilet.  No, he isn't ticked off at you, he probably is just confused as to why sometimes it is okay to go in the house and sometimes not.  Let him know, it is not okay to go in the house.  Starting today, crate him when you can't watch him, do not give him the opportunity to go in the house.  If it means going outside with him and doing the happy puppy pee dance with him to let him know how excited you are that he peed where he was supposed to, do it.  What I did with my girl is took her outside and when she finished I said, "good girl" and gave her a cookie. I gradually moved the cookie from right after the potty to when we got inside, so that I didn't have to carry cookies with me. From then on, our routine was, if she let me know she needed to go out, and she actually went potty, when we got back in she got a cookie (no cookie for holding it and going in and out, but she tried-don't fall for it).
rc7GbYx9aa	bleach or something|`|AA12280631	If it's a dirt floor, maybe it would be best to dig up the dirt for a couple layers down ... then concrete the floor. Maybe this will work.|`|577312d9799114c6f0ed1845f3628bb3aa	Amonia, my mom uses it to get rid of just about any smell.  It works really good, a dog went to the bathroom in our car once (it was not saposed to be in there) and mom got rid of the smell in just about two days.|`|4k1Z9FbIaa	You need to use a chemical with enzymes in it to eliminate the ammonia from the urine.  Using ammonia will help to promote the ammonia already present, and can cause more bacteria to grow even with absence of smell.    First, with the dirt floor, dig out what you can.  Then put something with that enzyme on where the urine was.  Nature's Miracle is the most popular brand, and there are others.  You can use a black light to find the locations of the saturation for added accuracy.  Once that dries, you can use bleach to clean, but you don't need to.    Open windows, set up fans, get some ventilation in there.  And report it to anyone who will listen, because that was abuse of the cat.|`|MANMdzfCaa	Provided the urine and fece clumps are on the surface (minimal digging) I would find a shovel or a scoop and dispose of the waste. If the cats buried the waste, open the windows and let mother nature run her course. An open box or two of backing soda may help absorb the smell until the waste degrades into less odorous products.|`|MSo1Yyw8aa	Vinegar!  IT's cheap and it works well at getting odors out.  I'm not sure exactly how it would work on a dirt floor, though.|`|Zf7cifCUaa	First off, u must try and remove as much dirt as possible that has feces in it, then use bleach, keep bleaching full strength for a few days, use a broom to really rub the bleach into the dirt, make sure no other animals have access to it tho! it is a poison, remember ! The bleach helps knock the  smell out, open any windows you have down there too, a fan blowing will help dissapate any noxious fumes(FYI, you might want to wear a mask for this, the bleach will make your eyes tear up REALLY bad and breathing straight bleach fumes isn't good for your lungs!)and the fan will dry the dirt fast!

AA11338415	Get  professional dog trainer (that does not include petsmart/petco). And act quick if he has already bitten.|`|p7swtBYzaa	Neutering will certainly get him calmer, so will socializing him with people.  You had better do both - fast, before someone sues you for the dog bite.    Best thing would be to take him for obedience classes = ask your vet for a reference to a trainer who gives them or try Petco, they schedule them too.|`|kv3d8wbjaa	Fixing him is the first step.      Professional training would be the next step.      While you wait for the first lesson (hopefully not too long) do not walk him where he will have a chance to bite anyone.  If you cannot walk him where there are no people, then either a mesh muzzle or even a basket muzzle might be your best (hopefully temporary) bet.|`|FUmjD9b3aa	Neutering MIGHT calm him down.  You should really have neutered him when he was still a puppy.  It isn't a common thing for a Beagle to bite, what was the circumstance?  There are many types of muzzles.  I suggest you speak with a dog trainer on the best type for your purpose.|`|2b2db8c17256011e454bde38371abbecaa	neutering can help calm him down but there is a chance it will not help. if you are looking for a good muzzle you should look for one that looks like a basket. these still alow the dog to pant and breath like they should.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	Yes, fixing him will help calm him down.  At least part of his hyperness is from hormones.  But you'll also have to address the behavior part of it too.  Does he have dominance problems?  You might need to do dominance training with him, such as crating him, making him "work" for his food, making him roll over and show his belly to you a lot, and generally showing him you are the boss.  If you don't think you can do it alone, call a professional trainer for help.      You can get different muzzles that are humane.  There are cloth ones that you can buy that are humane.  You could also try getting him a Halti or Gentle Leader head collar.  Then, whenever he launches forward, the collar will close his mouth.  Might help on walks....
AA12241765	First off -  some dogs (like pugs) are NOTORIOUSLY stubborn when it comes to housebreaking. I have two pugs and I feel your pain!    Spanking, yelling or rubbing your dog's nose in the mess won't help. Dogs live moment to moment and unless you get his attention WHEN he is "doing the deed", she won't understand WHY he is getting disciplined. It will just make her afraid of you. As much as puppies act like kids, you can't treat them like one. Again, I am not yelling or nagging at you. I am speaking from experience.    There are a few things that you need to do. First - clean EVERYTHING that she has marked with an enzyme cleaner. I personally recommend Nature's Miracle. If she can smell even a LITTLE bit of where she has "gone" before, she WILL go there again. You need to clean the rugs, furniture, etc. Basically, you need to wipe the slate clean of scents.    The key to getting her trained RIGHT is to pay CLOSE attention to her and give her LOTS and LOTS of praise when she DOES go outside.  You will basically have to confine her to a certain area when you can keep a direct eye on her at all times. Let her drink, and then take him RIGHT outside to the place where you want her to "go". Say "Time to go pee" when you are taking her outside. Do NOT play with her while you are outside. Wait for her to go "pee" and if she DOES "go" outside, give her LOTS of REALLY tasty treats. Sing praises. Make a fool out of yourself. Remember, dogs act on a strictly "cost/benefit" analysis. "What does doing this behavior gain me?" If "going" outside gets her treats and praise, she will WANT to start doing this. If she doesn't go outside on the first trip, bring her back inside and put her back in her crate for about a half hour. Don't give her any more water. Wait about a half hour and take her out again. Remember, DON'T play with her on these trips and to say "Time to go pee". Keep making the half hour trips until she goes and THEN take her for a walk, play a game with her. Make it WORTH HER WHILE to go outside. Make that "cost/benefit" analysis mentality WORK for you!    Dogs ALWAYS give a sign when they are getting ready to "go". They may circle, start sniffing, etc. That's why it is SO important to keep your dog in a place where you can DIRECTLY keep an eye on her. They also generally will not "go" in the house if you are watching them. They will "stealth pee" (go into another room or wait until you leave). When my stepson was helping housebreak one of our pugs, he kept her leashed to him when she wasn't in her crate. Within two days, she was "going" outside.      If you haven't had her "fixed", you need to do that. Dogs that are fixed don't mark NEARLY as much as those who aren't. Also, there are MANY health benefits to having a dog fixed.    I truly hope these tips help!  Good luck!|`|kzLi2YBkaa	I just got a dog and I keep her in the cage. Everytime I take her out of the cage, I make sure I see her every move. When she looks like she'll pee, I will motion her to go to the pad and let her pee there. When she pees at the right place, I'll give her a treat and act really happy by clapping and saying "Good girl!" in a high voice. She started to understand that I'll get happy only when she peed at the pad so now she knows where to pee. When she pees at the wrong place, just be quiet and clean up really quick. Dont scold her or say anything.  But be extra praising when she does the right thing and remember to give her treats.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Put the water dish outside.. Dogs find it much easier to learn to ask to go outside to get a drink than they do to ask to go outside to pee...|`|06ec886c7d8a90ee05f754772645f600aa	First, how old is she? Yorkies (and many other small breeds) are notoriously hard to house train. You may just be expecting too much in too little time.     If you've tried all the "no brainer" stuff, the only thing I can really suggest is a doggy door. It can work wonders for difficult to house train dogs. Of course, it will only work if you have a safe area (like a fenced-in backyard) for them to go.|`|FZQusTstaa	Take her outside every few minutes and give her a treat when she goes potty outside.  Or you can try using the "doggie pads"  (I don't know what they are really called)  Keep moving it towards the door then move it outside and leave the door open.  That's how I trained all of my dogs.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	Crate training is the best way.  Terriers can be really hard to train.  You have to get a crate that is on the small side, or she'll just pee on one side and sleep on the other.  Take her out often and give her a treat and praise her for going potty outside.  When she's not in the crate, watch her like a hawk.  If you see her start to go in the house, grab her right away and take her outside.  The most important parts of this are: small crate and treats for going potty.    You can also try wee wee pads or dog litter.  If you do crate training for about 3 months very consistently and she still doesn't get it, call a professional dog trainer for help.|`|pLCtEBf5aa	Well, I don't know what you have tried yet. But I will tell you if you put ANYTHING down on your floor in the house you will begin to teach your dog that you want her to go in the house, on the floor. When you decide that you are tired of that, you will have one heck of a time getting her to understand. Dogs need to be taught from the very beginning what you want them to do. Consistency, and repetition are the only way they learn. So..If you use paper or pads and try to move them around the house, when there is no paper or pad she will either look for any paper she can find, or just go in the last place the paper was. Unless moving the paper around closer to the door, makes her think she can go anywhere in the house. Consistency and repetition. Remember. So. you will need to take her out after every meal. You did not say how old she is so I really don't know if she's stubborn or just young. But keep letting her know that you want potty outside. Praise the heck out of her when she gets it right. If you take her to the same place in the yard every time she will smell that she has gone there before and begin to figure it out.  Good luck
P1mi6pUYaa	You should see your vet.  There's only a short window of time where you can get their ears cropped, and it's when they're pretty young.  Once their ears' cartilage stops growing and strengthening, it's too late.  You can get it done at the vet's office.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Depends on the vet.. Some won't do it past 12 weeks some will do it up to 16 weeks ( YIKES) There are BAD vets that will do it after 16 weeks, but it's likely the ears won't stand at all when you do it that late.    You should research vets in your area if you really want to get the ears done.. There are good ear croppers and there are butchers. Talk to others in the area that have dogs w/ cropped ears that you like, find out who did their ears..    It is hard on the dogs, and don't let anyone tell you that it isn't.. It is surgery.. Much longer surgery than just a spay or neuter.. There is alot of blood loss.. There is no reason to crop the ears unless you are trying to look like a tough guy.. Or if you fight your dog.. It is easier to socialize a dog with natural ears as people are more inclined to help you by approaching you and your dog and helping to show the dog that people are good.. I think it's a bad idea..      Edit : The ears are NOT cut off using NO pain killers.. That is ridiculous.. It's just like any other surgery, the dog is put under with proper anesthesia, and the ears are done.. Only some backalley fool is cropping ears without anything for pain or anesthesia.. Do some research before you make statements about something you don't know about..|`|ubrYk78waa	You can have cropped about a week after you have yours cropped to look like Mr. Spock.|`|2rJONL48aa	Who would be cruel enough to hurt a puppy? That's vanity-- cropping ears does not help the dog in any way-- it helps the owner because they think it's "cool". It's called "animal abuse". Do the dog a favor and realize what you're about to do causes a lot of undue pain.     Would you like your ears cut half off  just because someone decided it would make you look better? That's a pretty rotten thing to do to any animal.    EDIT: I've seen people do some pretty bad things to animals without painkillers. Including cropping ears.|`|ill19Iizaa	One of our pitbulls' ear was cropped when it was five months old, when it should have been done on its fourth month.|`|CsKGdUx0aa	I don't know of any vet that will do this after 12 weeks of age. Either way, it's painful for the pup. Why not leave the ears natural?|`|iZWBFGaraa	you are so cruel to have that done to your dog, what pain you inflict on your animal wil come back to you three fold...|`|gU0hNkaVaa	Why crop their ears? People only crop pit bull's ears to make them look cool or mean. It is unnecessary and painful. Just leave their ears the way they are supposed to be....natural.
P1mi6pUYaa	http://search.petfinder.com/search/searc...    This is a search I did on petfinder.com for Bassets in Denver.  I'm so glad you are thinking of adopting.  There are so many sweet rescue dogs that are homeless.  You can take your puppy to meet the new one, too, to see if they get along.  Good luck!|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	The Basset Hound Club of America has information on basset rescue groups.    http://www.basset-bhca.org/Finding/Rescu...    Here's the Colorado rescue group  http://www.webiphy.com/bassetrescue/    Or if you're looking for a puppy from a breeder, here is the BHCA's breeder information.  http://www.basset-bhca.org/Finding/Findi...|`|1FopKjA8aa	My best advice is ... don't get another puppy!  Rather, get an adult dog from Breed Rescue.  If you adopt an adult (even a young adult) from Basset Rescue, you will be doing yourself and your pup a huge favor.  Your older dog will help train your younger dog!  AND ... the older one will already be spayed/neutered, up-to-date on shots, and socialized/trained.    Adopting from Breed Rescue is win-win, for you and the dog that you adopt ... and your pup reaps the rewards, as well.  I recommend you look into it.  Good Luck!    Ooops, sorry ... forgot to say this ... look at akc.org to find out how to contact Basset Rescue in your area ... or contact the Breed Club ... these people WILL help you!|`|ATxCmUKXaa	there are a few shelters in denver  go to all of them and see if they have any which they probably will    http://muttcats.com/shelters/colorado.ht...    also petfinder.com  good luck

2P5WRadhaa	Most cities have spay/neuter clinics at little or no cost.  You'll probably have to pay a little fee to take care of expenses.  Sometimes animal shelters contract with vet clinics for reduced rates.  Check it out.  Some breeders can maybe direct you to a source.  Good Luck.   PS You're being wise to spay your dog.  Even if it ends up costing you,  the benefits are well worth it.|`|wX3RzHaRaa	Contact local shelters in your area, they will help you find a low cost spay/neuter clinic.|`|ySI467Seaa	Dont know where there, but there is always a place who takes care of it.

Also, maybe one of your local vets may know of a place that spays for free.|`|P1mi6pUYaa	Call up your local animal shelter or animal control department and ask them where you can get free or low cost spaying in your area.  They always know that stuff.  Also, search online for free or low cost spaying in your state.  Sometimes there are independent organizations that do it.

Sugest?o, verifique as capsulas injetveis com efeito de 21 dias, os efeitos colaterais, na maioria das pessoas, s?o nulos e tem a vantagem de lhe deixar "mais" tranquila com rela??o sua esquecimento/eficcia.

KLkjAcPPaa	La socializacin y el adiestramiento del cachorro son de extrema importancia tanto como la "infancia" del cachorro es la etapa ms crtica y ms importante del desarrollo del perro. Qu hacer y qu no hacer ahora afectar la conducta de su perro para siempre.    Una apropiada socializacin del perro hace de nuestro amigo una buena compa?a. Es importante que el cachorro no sea ni asustadizo ni agresivo hacia cualquier persona o cualquier cosa que apareceran normalmente en la vida diaria. Un perro no socializado es poco fiable y una deuda no deseada. Pueden convertirse en mordedores por miedo. Con frecuencia querrn pelear con otros perros. Son difciles de adiestrar e intolerables. Los perros no socializados no pueden adaptarse a situaciones nuevas y una simple visita de rutina al veterinario es una pesadilla no slo para el perro, sino que para todos los que estn involucrados. No deje que esto le pase a usted y a su perro. Comience a socializar a su perro ahora mismo. La Universidad Cornell de Medicina Veterinaria (Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine) acepta que el perodo de socializacin dura hasta las 12 semanas (3 meses) de edad. No obstante, pasadas las 12 semanas, el cachorro debe continuar socializando para afinar sus habilidades sociales. La mayor parte de la socializacin ocurre antes de los 3 meses de edad. Un poco ms tarde que eso y se volver un proceso agudsimamente difcil y consumir ms tiempo; sabiendo que muy pocos due?os tienen el tiempo, la energa y el dinero o la paciencia para afrontarlo.    Qu hacer    Asegrese que cada una de las siguientes situaciones sean agradables y no amenazantes. Si la primera experiencia de su cachorro con algo es dolorosa o atemorizante su propsito se arruinar. En efecto, usted estar creando una fobia que posiblemente durar toda la vida. Es mejor ir muy lento y asegurar que su cachorro no sea intimidado o da?ado al apurarse o forzarlo a conocer cosas y personas nuevas:    > Invite a sus amigos a conocer a su cachorro. Incluya hombres, mujeres, jvenes, ancianos y ojal personas de diferentes razas, etc.  > Invite a cachorros amistosos, sanos y vacunados o incluso gatos a su casa para jugar con su nuevo cachorro. Lleve a su perro a las casas de otras mascotas y de preferencia con gatos amistosos o acostumbrados a los perros.  > Lleve a su cachorro a centros comerciales, parques, plazas de juegos, etc.; lugares donde haya mucha gente y lleno de actividades.  > Lleve a su cachorro a cortos, pero frecuentes paseos en auto. Detenga el auto y deje que su cachorro vea el "mundo" a travs de la ventana.  > Presntele paraguas, bolsas, cajas, la aspiradora, etc. Anime a su perro a explorar e investigar su entorno.  > Procure que su cachorro se acostumbre a ver objetos diferentes y desconocidos creados por usted mismo. Coloque una silla patas arriba. Coloque un tarro de basura (vaco) botado, coloque la tabla de planchar de un lado un da y cabeza abajo otro da.  > Presente a su perro sonidos nuevos y variados. Los sonidos fuertes y molestos deben ser presentados desde cierta distancia y acercarlo gradualmente.  > Acostumbre a su cachorro a ser cepillado, ba?ado, inspeccionado, a tener las u?as recortadas, a dejarse limpiar los dientes y orejas y todas las rutinas de aseo y examinacin fsica.  > Presente a su perro a las escaleras, a su propio collar y correa. Presntele cualquier cosa que usted quiera que su perro acepte y con la que se sienta confortable.|`|Tvva1cYzaa	LA SOCIABILIZACION SE DA EN FORMA NATURAL ENTRE LOS 45 Y 90 DIAS DESPUES DEL NACIMIENTO Y LO QUE SE LE PUEDE ENSE?AR DESPUES ES TOLERANCIA ESTO L?O PUEDES REALIZAR AL SACARLO A PASEAR CON UN COLLAR DE MANEJO ( LLAMADOS DE CASTIGO) Y UNA CORREA LARGA DE 2 METROS DE LARGO CUANDO TU PERRO SALE CONTIGO YA QUE NO DEBE SALIR SOLO A LA CALLE PORS U PROTECCION Y HACIA LOS DEMAS LO VAS A CORREGIR SI EL LADRA U GRU?E O WERIZA SU PELO DE LA ESPALDA CON UN LIGERA JA?ON DEL COLLAR PARA QUE SEPA QUE ESE COMPORTAMIENTO ESTA MAL AHORA SI NO TE SIENTES CON LA CAPACIDAD PARA LLEVARLO A CABO LLEVALO A UNA ESCUELA PARA QUE LO EDUQUEN Y AHI APRENDERA CON LOS DEMAS PERROS ASER TOLERANTE MEDIANTE LA ADQUISISCIONDE ORDENES.MVZ ALEJANDRO GERARDO SANTIAGO SANTIAGO CED.

Os termos zoossexual e zoossexualidade descrevem toda a gama de orienta??o humana/animal. Um outro termo, bestialidade, se refere ao ato sexual entre um humano e um animal n?o-humano (chamado a partir daqui apenas "animal").
