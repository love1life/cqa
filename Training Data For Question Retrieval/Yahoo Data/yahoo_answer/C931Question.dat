I work in a hotel at the front desk and this is what happened:      I reported to my General Manager on the weekend when I had a chance about how my cell phone number got leaked to a hotel guest.  I had no idea as of who it was and I was nervous because that following week the guest called me cell phone twice and left voicemails (I did not know the number - thus I do not pick up).  It was busy due to groups so I had no chance a few days after the event happened to explain it to my General Manager.      On Monday I found out who it was and it was one of the girls I really do like at work who gave the guest my cell in which I gave her ages ago because we talk and text sometimes.  She got written up but in a way I feel bad.  She said she was going to tell me that she did it and figured it would not be a problem because I do talk frequently to this guest/client.  However, she never got the chance to do so.        I feel bad that she got written up.  She is like 8 months pregnant and I wish I could have known because then I would have not told my General Manager.  When I reported it was that right?  I was seriously worried as this is my privacy here.  I dunno what to do or think.

When the stock is first sold the company gets paid for issuing new stock I understand this, but the stock then sells on the secondary market in the exchanges. The company no longer owns the stock so how does the stock value affect the company. I don't see how the stock price and the value of the company are connected.

My boyfriend (28) and I (21) have been dating a little over two years and are considering buying a house to take advantage of the cheaper market and tax breaks right now. We would probably only stay in the house 2-3 years and then rent it out or sell it depending on the market.      My boyfriend is currently in school but worked a lot before he started college and saved up a good sum of money and established very good credit. I graduated from college last year and am now working for a moderate level income but I will be going to graduate school this year.      Basically, if we buy the house, my boyfriend would have to pay the entire down payment because I have no money saved and I would pay half of the mortgage. His perspective is that I should have no ownership of the house because I have not done the difficult part to save up money and establish good credit. However, being that I am usually the one taking care of all administrative parts of our current apartment and doing most of the cleaning, I don't feel right putting time and emotional energy into something that I don't have any rights to.      Does anyone have any advice on a similar situation and how they handled it? I am not with my boyfriend to take advantage of his money and I know that I could never purchase a house on my own right now, but I guess I also would like to maintain some sort of independence and not just live in "someone else's" house, even if I only own 10%!

We have a shop, about 6,000 square feet (imagine a big room about a third the size of a football field) and one of the employees whistles all day long, from the minute he walks in the door in the morning until he’s walking out the door at night.      Drives me fricken insane!      There are seven of us all together, the whistler, two that don’t seem to mind, two that are annoyed and two of us that are about ready to beat him to death with a baseball bat. (one of whom is me, the owner of the company)      He is an awesome employee, an older guy (50ish) always shows up, works hard, does a good job and is generally a nice happy guy.

One is for sale and the other we are going to have to evict the tenant because they have not paid rent for 3 months. We are currently living with my parents in Tampa because of my husbands job. What would you do? I would like to foreclose on both houses, but I know that hurts your credit really bad. We are paying both mortgages which equal to a littler over 2 grand a month. Plus we just had a baby in November. Would you hold out to see if Obama will sign something about homeowners and foreclosures? Would you foreclose because how bad can it hurt your credit anyways in this kind of economy? We just struggle finding renters that can take care of the property and not trash it, especially when we are not in the city to keep a good eye on it. Any advice would be helpful. Thanks!

20090225081920AAHmf6k	Business & Finance;Credit	So where the hell do I even begin...?	First off I would like to Thank everyone who is taking the time to read this.      Im 23 years old. When I was 18-19 I made some bad choices that have affected my credit...go figure.      Im really not that much in debt. My guess is anywhere from 2,000 - 3,000 dollars. Its probably about a total of 7 or 8 things that I have not paid off including an electric bill for about $120, a cable bill for about $100, a cell phone bill for about $800, and then I took a couple small loans out through some finace companies.(stupid i know) I owe about 3 of those finance companies about $150 each.       Now I know I was stupid. I was very young though and I have no parents so I didnt know what I was doing. Now that Im older I want to fix this. I have paid my bills all on time for the last two years, and have not created anymore debt since then. Im going to get a secured credit card through Bank of America and make small purchases every month and pay it right off.       My question is about paying my old debt off though. Someone told me that since a couple of those things are from 5 years ago that I shouldnt pay those older ones because in 2 years they will fall off the report? The thing is I do want to pay them off though. Its my resposibility to..I heard that if I start paying them off then they will stay on the report for ANOTHER 7 years because im "opening" the account back up..even though im technically paying them off..if that makes any sense.      Should I just start paying them off from smallest amount to largest no matter how old they are? Ive heard sometimes you can talk the amount down as long as you promise to pay it off..is this true?       Again, I really appreciate any advice you guys can help me with. As mentioned I have no parental figures so im figuring this all out on my own....

Save this file and then change the extension to .pdf and open it.      They have made it hard as possible since if you double click the .aspx file, the PC does not know what to do with it because it has the wrong extension for a pdf file.      Also, when you mail your cancellation send it via certified mail as you will need confirmation that they received it for legal purposes, otherwise they can deny they ever got it.

I recently went through a divorce.  My ex allowed some property we owned to be foreclosed on.  At the time there was nothing I could do (financially) to stop it.  There currently is a lis penden judgment against both of our names for around $40,000.   I know, I know…..disaster.    I tried to stop this by providing documents from the divorce showing he was responsible for all debts, etc.  This paperwork does not apply in general court.       My thinking is that I would like to own the home and remain there as a stable environment for the kids.  I have heard that these judgments usually will only sit-in-wait for about 10 years.  I have no desire to sell and I was hoping to surpass the 10 year mark so that the lien would not affect me.  I hate to lose the ability to claim interest etc by not owning the property.        I am currently living in the home I would like to purchase (property is in my mother’s name). Can I purchase the home “in trust” or “rent to own”?        Advice?

Ich ersetze einen renommierten, ?lteren und allseits beliebten Lehrer, und frage mich, ob ich dem angetretenen Erbe gewachsen bin.

Es wird immer schwieriger mit Freude zur Arbeit zu gehen.    Ich weiss nicht, ob ich kündigen oder mich durchbeissen soll.       Ich bin dankbar für jeden ernst gemeinten Ratschlag.

I called my bank only to find out that no one knew anything about it. Just that it was done at my local teller. Now if it was five bucks, I'd be calm and just wait for someone to contact me, but this was almost 200 dollars AND it brought me down to the negatives. Needless to say, I was charged an additional 20 bucks in overdraft fees. I've had them send a request for an investigation, but I was wondering if anyone (preferebly someone with banking experience) knows anything about this and if it's common. Will I get my money back?

Can they hire a sheriff to come into my house and just start taking stuff?  I live in NC.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.
