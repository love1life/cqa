20090226144144AA9Noyg	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	Any REAL air combat sims on the way?	After seeing the Hawx demo (in the Euro store right now) I am disappointed, after all the secrecy about its content it turns out to be an arcade game with no attempt at realism, except the token inclusion of stalls. Not surprised though since it's made by Ubisoft, who are legendary for their terrible "flight simulators."         Anyone know of an actual air combat simulator in the works for ps3 - meaning, with g-force limits, realistic control, weather, and with realistic ammo counts (like, 8 AA and 4 atg missiles, the most any fighter carries today).      And where your F-15 actually handles like an F-15 and not like a Warhawk! (download the Hawx demo and see for yourself... it is pretty silly). And where you can turn off the alpha limiter without going into a faraway 3rd person mode where you can't aim your cannon...     Not just ranting here... seriously, anyone know of any... or are they all still on PC?     Can Ace Combat, Blazing Angels and Hawx really be all there is for consoles...

20090226153120AAamjPd	Consumer Electronics;TVs	My TV in LIMBO...any ideas or suggestions?	So, let me just preface this by saying NEVER buy a TV made by funai (Sylvania or Emerson). I "have" a 32' lcd hdtv emerson and last summer I noticed a dark smudge appearing at the top of the screen. It soon traced all the way down the screen as if someone had run their thumb down it. I called customer service as I was still under warranty. I was told by the operator to take it to a service station (which was over and hour away) and if it costs more than $60, to call them and they would take care of it...essentially I wouldn't have to pay any more than $60 to have it fixed is what I was told. Well the service station said I needed a new display panel and it would cost $140 on top of the $40 I already paid them to look at it. Needless to say I called funai and talked to the same operator...he said oops...I meant if they wanna charge more then $60, just ship it to us and we can fix it...we only charge $60. Oh well. So I drove an hour away to pick up my tv and had it picked up from my apartment a week or so later. My tv was then gone for about 6 weeks, then I got it back on saturday. I was very excited...but once the tv was on for over an hour I noticed that they fixed NOTHING. The smudge was still there. The following monday I called AGAIN and the new operator told me...oh yeah...it wasn't supposed to fixed in the forst place...they were just supposed to exchange and send you a new one. So, THIS TIME I was sending it in for an "EXCHANGE". My tv was picked up on November 12th and it has now been over 15 weeks. I have no tv. I have called them numerous times. They will not offer me a refund. I have talked to "floor managers". One gentleman even said he has no idea where my tv is or when I will get it. The last person I talked to said that they were waiting to get a new tv in the warehouse to ship out to me. This is where I currently stand; no tv...and what seems like no recourse...any ideas????? PLEASE HELP!!!!!! Again, this has been going on since the beginning of August '08.      p.s. I already plan on contacting bbb.

20090226095441AAoST9Y	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	Xbox 360 Return policy, UK?	I have a defective Xbox 360 console that refuses to read discs about 75% of the time.       I have tried literally brand new games in it that have not worked properly. Errors are quite random - occasionally the problem will occur during the game and result in a "Disc Read Error", other times the console will recognise one of  the discs as a DVD and ask me to "Play this disc in an Xbox 360 Console".      I assume this is a problem with the laser but I am unsure as to what Microsoft's policy in regards to this is. The warranty I have from Gamestation has expired so this is unfortunately no longer an option.      If anyone has experienced a similar problem and has returned a console to Microsoft then this would be very helpful thanks.

I have a 60GB ipod which is near enough filled......My laptop is playing up at the moment so I wanted to transfer the contents to the itunes on my childrens' PC.  However, when I plug it in, it opens as a disc drive but only shows folders for photos and a couple of other things - it doesn't bring up any of my music at all!!  The only tunes I could transfer were the ones I had purchased from iTunes store.  Surely there must be some way to transfer my own albums across as I don't fancy sitting for days, importing them all again! Thaks in advance for your help.

It seemed fine and worked fine afterwards. I decided to charge it cause it was running low on battery, and then went to bed. But, I woke up this morning, after about 6 hours and it only got to maybe 30%, usually it gets too 100% after an hour or two max. I'm charging it right now and it still isn't getting anywhere. The iPod itself works and nothing seems to be wrong but the battery won't charge all the way! Has this happened to anyone else? And does anyone know how I could fix this?

I'm becoming not to happy with the phone company, and not land  line, companies that promise perfect coverage and don't deliver.       I have Verizon Wireless, and my girlfriend has Sprint, and one of us are losing the messages, it's either she isn't receiving them or I'm not sending them, either way I'm getting annoyed.      Could it be the phone that have the problems?    Or would it be the providers?      Either way next year my contract is up with Verizon and I'm not to sure if I want to keep them anymore, I'm buying a BlackBerry Curve, should I keep Verizon? Or ditch them?      Also if you could answer if it's the phone or the provider, that would be great.      Note: If you could provide some explanations it would be greatly appreciated.

Just wondering whether anyone else has come across this and if there is a way around it. I've been playing the single player game then a mate came round and i wanted to let him start from the beginning so it was a bit easier so i started a new game under my user. Now when i play i have to go in to load a level rather than use the continue option. That's a bit of a pain but not too bad. The problem is that it doesn't seem to remember any checkpoints, i have to finish a whole level for it to save properly now. I normally don't get to play for long sessions so i'm never gonna finish it like that!       Any ideas on how to get the game to remember the checkpoints and go back to using the 'continue game' option?      Thanks

20090226145740AACD9ZH	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	SUSPENDED ON XBOX LIVE ???!!!! When time zones do new days start and is this messed up or what ?	So idk how, but i got suspended from xbox live. I have been asking for ms. pnts. codes, but idk if that was it, i did post a few questions on this site too about if u can still file complaints on gt to change them, and i said it was for my friend and if u can than do it, bc i'm really poor and i dont like people to know. i only got my xbox bc i had a job. i get SS cuz my dad died, and i live wit my gparents, and there retirments going away cuz they cant use my money unless its related to me, and most of it goes to my ins. and meds. I have to help pay bills wit my work money, and the rest i save which is like $20 - $50 a month for college. And like 3 wks ago i had to quit bc a cook slapped a cup out of my and hand and pushed me into the dishwasher agressively, and the manager was right there and didnt do s***. i posted a blog on myspace to see if u could there too, and i said if anyone wants to try my gt is ******. add urs and ill complain too. (both stupid ideas, i dont want to hear a word bout it, but i had no choice ). My mother if ur wonder is in cal. and was an unstable at my fathers death. Now shes fine but shes in the buttcrack of society too. So i've been asking for lots of things. So if microsoft knew this maybe they would have thought twice about suspending me since it's the only life i got. ( if your wondering why i have an xbox and internet and a computer, i got the computer when my dad died bc i got his last paycheck from work cuz my gparents felt bad). We were doing good till 9/11 ( dad died same year in april ). My gparents had a lot of stock in the trade center like lots of ppl. then they had to take care of me while they retired.( no interest in retirement, just savings). so i turned 14 and got a job and saved money to get an xbox. They pay electricity and stuff, i pay for our cell phone, internet, and xbox. So yea thats why i've been trying cuz its like the only thing i got besides friends. So then I was on xbox.com yesterday in school and i wasnt banned then. I also win money and points in tourneys on halo, but I have to use it for live and bills, left over goes for college. I came home and posted my two ?'s on here and blog on myspace. I tried to go on and i was suspended till the 27th. ? #1 Do you think that is messed up that they can suspend you when they dont know what your going through? #2 So what time zone does xbox count to start the 27th ?    (srry this is a duel category so i didnt know where to file it )   P.S. I am serious, so if u don't believe it, critisize it, or use a then why can you _____ statement you can f-off.   Srry for language. not intended to affend anyone, companys, just venting.

If not, will they re-issue coupons for those who were unable to attain a converter from the first batch that stores were selling? Does anyone know about this?

I can use Alltel, but it costs $10 a month for each phone, but if i can do it without that extra $10 a month, i would love to use it. Also let me know if i have to register with the site. Is there anyway to get the program to integrate with Google Earth, because that would make things a lot easier to use.

My friend give me his Ipod touch and when you select settings the first to appear is the wifi bar but it says no wifi and it is greyed out and it wont let me choose any option for wifi.

A salesman at Staples told me that all new gaming systems already had  a wireless card or whatever it needs.  My son always plugs in the ethernet. If we can get some of the cords out of the way I would love it.
